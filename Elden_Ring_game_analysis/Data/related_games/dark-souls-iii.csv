Dream_For_Game,"Dark Souls III: An Examination of a Challenging and Evolved MasterpieceDark Souls III is a title that immediately conjures an image of a breathtaking challenge and an evolved experience compared to its predecessors. In a succinct description, it can be deemed “extremely difficult.” While the first two installments of this series also received similar reviews upon their release, this particular iteration has proven increasingly difficult and challenging, deterring many from continuing the journey, unaware that they are being deprived of experiencing a high art **** mechanics and gameplay of this title are significantly in line with the previous two entries; the player steps into the cold and soulless world of Dark Souls with a slew of unanswered questions and uncertainties regarding their motivation for battle. As mentioned earlier, the gameplay has overall integrity, but is accompanied by more finesse and fluidity, completely eliminating the dry and disjointed feel of Dark Souls II’s gameplay. In fact, from a gameplay perspective, Dark Souls III demonstrates remarkable and significant progress. However, other aspects remain largely the same, and the player is required to upgrade their weapons throughout the game. Also, if using a “magic build,” searching and discovering various spells becomes essential. The overall structure of the game, despite the vastness of the environments, follows a linear path, avoiding providing the player with unbridled freedom of action.From a visual standpoint, the game’s graphics have improved compared to the previous version. However, what has always been of great importance in the Dark Souls series is the atmospheric and innovative design of the game’s environments, which encourages the audience, despite the excruciating difficulty of the game, to persevere and advance. In addition to the eye-catching environments, the side characters and side quests are designed with such quality that they encourage the player to experience the game repeatedly in order to fully understand the events; a point that was also evident in NieR: Automata.Meanwhile, Boss Fights have always been known as one of the most memorable and prominent pillars of the Dark Souls series. This version not only preserves this authenticity but also provides battles with far superior and more challenging designs compared to the previous two entries. Although the design of the game’s environments and boss fights appears impressive overall, some environments lack sufficient appeal, and some bosses ultimately appear so weak that they can be considered ordinary enemies.Nevertheless, Dark Souls III confronts the audience at every moment with its novel challenges and unique surprises. Each environment, in addition to its specific boss, benefits from unique traps and special enemies. In this game, there are numerous ways to complete: using hand-to-hand combat, using magic, or a combination of both. Ultimately, the game’s ultimate goal will be to ignite the First Flame, extinguish it, or enter an age of darkness.Regarding storytelling, Dark Souls III refrains from providing a straightforward narrative. With the exception of the game’s initial cutscene, the storyline continues to be presented solely through the texts in the items. This allows the audience to determine the amount of clarity or ambiguity of the story. Although many players, due to the difficulty of the game, the challenging battles and the attractive boss fights, do not pay much attention to the story, Dark Souls III has a rich and complex story that can be confidently considered the richest and most complex story in the history of video games. In order to understand this story, a careful examination of all the items and a study of the narratives related to them is essential. Interacting with the game’s characters can also help to better understand the story.Ultimately, Dark Souls III offers an experience that transcends the ability of any other game.",10,2025-02-12,PLAYSTATION 4,user
BumpkinSTABBY,"this is just a classic dark souls game. it has everything you would expect in a good ds game. bosses are great, movement is great. and the difficulty is reasonable. what i didnt like however, is that the game started to grow bigger, more open spaces, more open fields but less branching paths. it honestly feels like they were prepairing for an open world ds game. honestly if they had released elden ring instead of ds3 and called it ds3 i would absolutely love it. as it stands though, ds 3 is great and elden ring is just ds 3 with big open fields.",9,2025-02-04,PLAYSTATION 4,user
ultrasoft,"Smooth and fun to play, they really refined the mechanics of play nicely. It's the best feeling in the hands that Dark Souls ever gets. There is a multitude of fun stuff to collect and play with, and tons of character builds to make. I had a lot of fun as a sneaky sorcerer, a twin blade wielding sellsword, and a healing cleric, and many others. The bosses are some of the funnest (and toughest) in the series. My favourites being the epic Slave Knight Gael fight, the Twin Demons and the Lothric and Lorian fight, which I feel comes closest to a DS1 boss in terms of tonality. Unfortunately, the game is far more linear than DS1, which weakens replay value. The lore, story, characters and writing failed to provoke the same gutpunching emotional connectivity of DS1 for me. There is a similar lack of genre (and game convention) bending innovation, mysterious weirdness, and just plain oddball stuff that made me fall in love with DS1. It's a bit too smoothed over in many regards, which I am sure is a pro to newcomers to the series and more casual gamers. It suffers from being a sequel and being the most formulaic iteration of Dark Souls so far. DS2 took more risks, which I respect, even though I am not a great fan of DS2 overall. There are fewer truly low points than DS1 (there is no truly obvious nadirs like Izalith) which is a positive, but there are fewer highs. It is a fun game (I played many hours, mostly co-opping bosses) but it just cannot stand up to DS1 or Bloodborne, and in that regard I couldn't help but feel some dissapoinment. There is a lot to like, but ds3 fails to be a brilliant game transcending experience I felt I got from DS1, which is, to be fair, an extremely lofty standard to live up to.",7,2025-02-01,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Universe_s,"This game feels more like a missed opportunity than a cohesive experience. While its core gameplay revolves around defeating enemies, there’s little to no narrative to provide context or purpose. The lack of a compelling story leaves the experience feeling hollow, as if the sole objective is to overcome increasingly difficult challenges without any meaningful **** difficulty itself is more frustrating than rewarding, often relying on cheap mechanics rather than skill-based progression. Coupled with uninspired level design and repetitive encounters, it fails to capture the player’s interest or offer a memorable **** the end, this title struggles to find an identity, leaving it as a forgettable entry in its genre.

I also mostly see people play this game because it is hard but I would rather call this game a no-difficulty-option game instead of a hard game!

zigacesen,"Pretty good, 8/10 because of bad UI design decisions and technical issues (a lot of pop in textures):kick should be custom bindable and input buffering shouldn’t exist, camera should not be this bad in a game from 2016, the boss should not ever leave the screen, lock on system should be omni directional with further range and should work regardless of line of sight, also there should be an option to disable the R3 to center camera, nameless king and king of the storm should be 2 separate boss encounters and aggro range for mobs should be smaller. After two playthroughs the cracks start to show and the general clunkiness starts to get annoying. Why am i constantly getting knocked down by normal enemies? Why am i constantly getting interrupted when attacking? I swear in my 70h of playing my attacks got interrupted at least 10 thousand times. It really starts to just feel bad to play. Also non-boss enemy design is too fast with too many combos that do too much damage. You can easily get completely stun locked to death by just two-three enemies. Cant heal, cant move, cant attack… its happened like 20 times. It doesnt make the game harder, just tedious and annoying",8,2024-08-30,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The music of this game is definitely at an award-winning level. In addition, the fact that it is a sad work increases its level of memorability even more.

AdoMobA,"Pros - crisp combat that feels fair - the best boss design in Dark Souls - the Ringed City DLC only serves to elevate the game - massive amounts of build variety // Cons - way less interconnected map design - the only good thing about Ashes of Ariandel is the final boss fight // Being the third game, following what many people consider a disappointing entry and ending the Dark Souls series, DSIII had to stick the landing. We are all lucky it didn't just stick it. DSIII landed on its feet and decided to do cartwheels. Best boss design among the three entries. Massive weapon, armor and ring variety that allows for an unimaginable amount of builds. Combat that doesn't feel like two trucks trying to flip each other over. It does everything right. As to the previously mentioned boss design, it is goated. Nameless King and the Slave Knight are my two favorite fights amongst everything Fromsoft has ever released. Dancer, Pontiff, Abyss Watchers are iconic. The only bosses I would label as bad are Aldritch, Wolnir and Scat Tree. DSIII also does something that is not just rare for a Fromsoft game, it is very rare in media in general. It provided one of the most cinematic and mechanically engaging fights as the very final thing you engage in. And where Gale runs, Nameless walks. Both of them are so mechanically perfect, that dying to them truly feels like a mistake on my part instead of a wrong hitbox. Ingenious. Dark Souls III is the rare media conclusion, where everybody left satisfied at the end. If you have doubts about jumping in, just take the leap and experience one of the best products, from one of gaming's biggest darlings.",10,2024-06-25,PLAYSTATION 4,user

tensioly,"Dark Souls III es el Dark Souls definitivo y el perfeccionamiento de una fórmula que durante años se ha ido puliendo para ser a día de hoy de las sagas más influyentes en la industria. Con unas 32 horas de juego habiendo completado gran parte del contenido opcional, este Soulslike ha conseguido encandilarme gracias a una jugabilidad muy completa y versátil, con multitud de formas de jugar, lo que otorga gran rejugabilidad. Los combates desafiantes frente a enemigos y jefes son en su mayoría magistrales y varios de ellos llegan a un nivel de epicidad y puesta en escena que consiguen colocarse en algunos de mis combates favoritos que he jugado nunca. A la impresionante jugabilidad se añade un gran diseño de diseño de mundo y un apartado artístico excelente que te transporta al Reino medieval de Lothric. A nivel gráfico es cumplidor y de rendimiento en PS5 funciona fluido a 60 fps. El apartado gráfico viene acompañado de una gran calidad a nivel de sonido y con una banda sonora con temas épicos para el recuerdo, probablemente siendo la mejor de la saga junto a Bloodborne. El DLC del Mundo Pintado de Ariandel me parece algo mejorable pero el de La Ciudad Anillada posee los que son fácilmente los mejores combates del juego y llega a un nivel de maestría excepcional. Como punto negativo puedo destacar la historia, que aunque estemos acostumbrados a que sea sutil, tanto en esta como en el lore del mundo me ha costado seguir su hilo más que en otros juegos de la saga. Dark Souls III es una obra maestra y un juego muy recomendado para todos los jugadores que deseen una experiencia desafiante y gratificante. 9,6/10 (06/2024)",10,2024-06-12,PLAYSTATION 4,user

PlagueTHEboy,"Dark Souls showed to be the greatest challenge for the franchise, and giving the fans an unforgettable experience. The game is not merely a challenging action RPG, but rather a captivating culmination of the series' expertly crafted formula. The combat itself is exquisite, a deliberate dance of precise strikes and strategic evasions that is truly unparalleled. Achieving mastery over it is an accomplishment in its own right, as is simply surviving in this eerily beautiful world. Every placement of enemies and every hidden corner feels meticulously designed to provide a constant sense of excitement. Dark Souls III is a triumph, a game that will leave a lasting impression long after the final credits have rolled.",10,2024-03-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user

nh59bany,"Dark Souls III is one of the rare games that feels like a constant icy shower on first playthrough with moments of constriction and discomfort, that erupt in joy and relief and a pride of success that I perceive as unparalleled in my long history of playing video games.I do not know how it feels if this is your first kind of game that is as uncompromising and unyielding as the Souls games than Dark Souls. It was my third after playing half through Bloodborne and being completely absorbed by Dark Souls I. If you found any joy in its gameplay style, in its gatekeeping and abstract story telling, in its shady and dubious worldbuilding, you will find in Dark Souls III a piece of art that is at the peak of presentation of atmosphere, boss fights, story-depth and the tragic twisted philosophical themes that stuck with me ever since. Read no further, start it and let it tumble over you - The only things keeping it from being a 10/10 is the occasional involuntarily over-powering on subsequent playthroughs, the equipment load juggling I simply do not like as an skilling moderator in the Souls games and the swamp level at Farron Keep that I perceive as bloated and redundant in its size.",9,2024-02-15,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Onebit,"Dark Souls 3, the final installment in the legendary series by FromSoftware, stands tall as a majestic and unforgettable swan song. With its refined gameplay mechanics, breathtaking visuals, and hauntingly atmospheric world, Dark Souls 3 delivers an experience that both honors its predecessors and carves its own **** of the standout features of Dark Souls 3 is its impeccable combat system. Building upon the foundation of the series, it introduces fluid and responsive gameplay that rewards skillful timing and strategic decision-making. Each encounter is a thrilling dance of life and death, demanding both patience and quick thinking. From tense sword fights to intense spellcasting, the combat is a true masterpiece that keeps players engaged and on the edge of their **** world design in Dark Souls 3 is an absolute marvel. Lordran and Drangleic may have been awe-inspiring, but Lothric surpasses them both. Every area is meticulously crafted, showcasing a breathtaking blend of gothic architecture, ruined castles, and eerie landscapes. The interconnectedness of the world delights players, offering shortcuts and hidden paths that make exploration a true joy. Unraveling the secrets hidden within Lothric is an adventure in itself, providing a sense of discovery and wonder.Graphically, Dark Souls 3 sets a new standard for the series. From grandiose vistas to the tiniest details, the game showcases stunning visual fidelity. The lighting effects, intricate textures, and attention to detail all contribute to an immersive and atmospheric experience. Dark Souls 3's gloomy yet beautiful art direction flawlessly captures a sense of impending doom and the decaying grandeur of the **** storytelling in Dark Souls 3 delivers a poignant tale that ties together the loose threads from its predecessors. The intricate lore is interwoven into the world, leaving breadcrumbs for players to discover and interpret. From enigmatic NPCs to cryptic item descriptions, the narrative unfolds gradually, offering moments of revelation and emotional weight. The somber yet captivating storytelling enriches the experience, leaving a lasting impression on the player.Multiplayer functionality in Dark Souls 3 continues to be a highlight. The seamless integration of cooperative play adds an element of shared triumph and camaraderie, while the unpredictable invasions keep players on their toes. Whether earnestly assisting others or engaging in intense PvP battles, the multiplayer component adds depth, replayability, and a sense of community to the game.While Dark Souls 3 excels on almost every front, a few minor blemishes prevent it from achieving a perfect score. Occasional technical issues and minor balancing inconsistencies detract slightly from the overall experience. However, these do not significantly impact the game's brilliance and are negligible in the face of its many achievements.",9,2024-01-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user

El mapa y los jefes están increíblemente diseñados y nunca he visto un juego tan bien diseñado como este, el mapa es muy extenso pero equilibrado a su vez y los jefes ni hablar simplemente es brillante cada batalla parece la ultima por la ""epicidad"" que tiene, pero hablando de la batalla final en si, aunque su dificultad no sea mucha como otros jefes es simplemente una de las peleas mas épicas de la historia de los videojuegos, la música, el rival, y por sobre todo un escenario increíble hace que sea una experiencia inolvidable.

Shockscape,"I will start with the positives. Overall all the bosses look cool. The combat is very similar to Elden Ring, so therefore great. And some of the bosses are just great, I mean the last bosses of both the base game and the DLC’s are exceptional. Also the story is quite interesting, but I can’t say I understood it from just the game. I had to watch a YouTube video to understand it. And you can’t forget some of the tracks in the soundtrack. They’re amazing. Now for the negatives. It’s just too tough in certain areas. I had to get lots of help in the form of online co-op just to get past some of the bosses, so it kinda ruined my enjoyment of the ones I got help for. Luckily I beat the final bosses for the base game and both the DLC’s because they’re the best in the game, however I got help for around half of the rest of the bosses. However I think you should enjoy it if you feel ready to master the game mechanics, or atleast get to grips with them. And don’t feel bad if you need to get help from online co-op, this game is hard, and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. There are people that will say your trash at games if you got help, and that you ruined the whole game. Don’t listen to them.",8,2023-09-16,PLAYSTATION 4,user

La sensación de estar perdido y solo en el mundo hace que cada uno se pueda centrar en crear a su personaje de forma inmersiva (tú personaje no sabe nada, por lo que tú tampoco). La historia está fragmentada en cientos de objetos, lo que le añade misterio. El diseño de enemigos normales como de jefes es perfecto y propio de una obra maestra como lo es este título.

JesseDillinger,"Ngl, some of these bosses are doodoo (Looking at you Curse-Rotted Greatwood, Deacons Of The Deep, and High Lord Wolnir). I wasn't liking the game at first because 5 bosses in a row was you vs a boss and his helpers. So it was always unfair. But I managed to get past them and overcome those dogwater bosses and get to great ones. Though Pontiff does technically have a clone he's actually one of the good ones. I'm in the minority for saying this, but I appreciate that this game is more linear. I get lost in these games so easily but I didn't need a guide at all for this one. In summary: After getting to the good bosses I ended up loving the game. I love FromSoftware.

Aqualonuss,"So es wird Zeit, dass dieser Review das gleiche widerfährt, dessen Schicksal auch alle anderen guten alten Spiele, oder Resident Evil 3, teilen. Ein REMAKE muss her. Jeder kennt es, fast jeder hat es schon einmal gespielt, und viele lieben es. Das ""schwerste Spiel aller Zeiten"" (aka. Dark Souls). Ich liebe diese Reihe und Dark Souls III gehört zu meinen absoluten Top Spielen, weshalb sich diese Review vielleicht so anhört, wie ein K-Pop Fangirl, dass dir versucht zu erklären warum BTS, die beste Band aller Zeiten ist. Im Vergleich mit seinen Vorgängern, hat Dark Souls III, eine etwas schnelleres Kampfsystem und eine wesentlich lineareren Aufbau was für den einen schlecht, für den anderen gut sein kann. Die Bosse und ihrer Inszenierungen sind bombastisch und gehören zu der Spitze der Reihe. Die Gebiete sind abwechslungsreich und schön düster gestaltet, was den Reiz am Spiel ebenfalls ausmacht. Der Soundtrack ist wundervoll und es gibt nichts was mehr mitreißender ist, als den Schlägen eines fast besiegten Bosses auszuweichen, während im Hintergrund eine aufbrausende Musik ertönt. Das Kampfsystem ist grandios, denn nicht umsonst ist es der Maßstab für gute RPG Kämpfe. Die DLCs sind auch empfehlenswert, wobei mich vor allem das zweite, sehr gepackt hat und mir endlos viele Stunden meines Lebens beim bekämpfen eines bestimmten Drachen genommen hat. Beim erneuten Durchspielen entdeckst du immer wieder neue Gebiete und durch seine verschiedenen Klassen und Spielweisen, wird es auch nach dem 8ten Run, nicht langweilig Also zum Abschluss, grandioses Spiel, grandiose Reihe.

ZangBang,"88/100 Dark Souls 3 chooses to focus on a more contained exploration than its predecessors, a much more streamlined map with few branching paths and thus less secret areas and less freedom given to the player on where to go next. This design philosophy allows each new area to be bigger and wide-ranging, but the lack of a tangled web of interconnecting paths like in the past diminishes the sense of freedom granted by exploration, and a slight overabundance of bonfires hurts the sense of tension, ultimately making the journey through Lothric significantly less adventurous than the one through Lordran or Yharnam. Nevertheless, the level design within each area remains of superb quality, as the traditionally multilayered dense map structure is chockfull of treasures and secrets to find and, as previously mentioned, the bigger scope of each area grants more room to explore. The combat system received a clear influence from Bloodborne, as it has a much faster pace now that ultimately ends up making rollspam a little overpowered, but with the usual focus on shielding and weight typical of the Dark Souls, and a magic system now better integrated with the rest of the mechanics. Testing our mettle with these systems, a traditionally excellent, fairly challenging set of enemies and an even better set of bosses. Dark Souls 3 hosts the absolute best, most high-quality array of bosses in the whole Soulsborne series. They frequently display incredibly distinct multiple phases and utilize varied attack patterns that rely on exclusive mechanics or unique playstyles that constantly challenge the player in new exciting ways. Even the worst ones are still highly entertaining thanks to interesting gimmicks that twist the usual formula without compromising on challenge. Narratively, Dark Souls 3 ends the trilogy with a somber, melancholic conclusion that delves deeper into the established concepts of the series, with a main focus on the human drama and tragedies linked to them.",8,2022-10-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user

BobsityJonesity,"A near-perfect end to a legendary series. This game is an improvement on nearly all accounts from the first and second game and hits back on all the themes presented. It starts out a little slow but quickly ramps up, especially near the end. Almost every boss has incredible polish that blows the first and second game out of the water and holds its own against bloodborne. The pace is much faster, which while making the combat feel different from 1 and 2, also allows for more fluidity and dynamic action. The DLCs follow in the soulsborne tradition in being the best part of the game's experience. While the ashes of Ariendel felt somewhat lackluster (except the sister Friede fight which I think is the best in the series), the Ringed city was easily my favorite DLC experience from any souls game, sporting compelling gameplay sections with groundbreaking bosses, 3 of which (Demon Prince, Midir, and Slave Knight Gael) have legitimate claims to be called best in the series.

9bb,This is from the perspective of a returning souls player. The bosses are very well designed. Bosses like Geal and pontiff really set the bar high and first seem like insurmountable challenges. Personally I wouldn’t actually mind more gimmick bosses. Like in demon souls. This is because while dark souls 3 bosses certainly are good. Few of hjem actually stand out. In demon souls bosses like maiden astrea felt really unique and memorable. A lot of bosses in demon souls were about outsmarting your foe this is something that has been lost. And I don’t think it would hurt dark souls 3 to experiment once in a while instead of all the bosses being about dodging at the right time. Not that the bosses in ds3 are bad its just that variation helpes. Another problem is that dark souls has a bit of an identity crisis. It has the setting and themes of dark souls with abit of bloodbourne dna. With references to demon souls dark souls and dark souls 2 every thirty minitues or so. Ds3 feels like it tries to be a best of dark souls arcade game. While this may sound good on paper. I think it works against the game and makes it feel like it doesn’t have an identity of its own. The level design of ds1 has not carried over. Some may like this many wont. The aesthetics are very grey. But they are supposed to be this way. Some may like it some may not. But over all it is still an incredibly good game. The bosses are still really good. The combat is very simple yet engaging. The world is for the most times well crafted. And I do recommend it,8,2022-07-29,PLAYSTATION 4,user

QilBoy,"Dark Souls III is an incredibly precise, elegant and fresh way to end this series. It takes (almost) all of the elements that made the previous installments great, and scales back or removes altogether (most but not all) of the series' weaknesses, resulting in what is unquestionably the overall best Dark Souls experience ever. Firstly: let's talk about the Level Design. The world interconnectivity of DS1 never came back, alas, and even the constant branching pathways that were still very much present in DS2 have been mostly lost: the progression through the game world of DS3 is more linear than it has ever been. This design choice makes the journey of DS3 feel a little less player-driven than the previous two, but it also comes with two great improvements: firstly, by streamlining the progression FromSoftware had better control over the difficulty curve of the experience, and secondly, the world doesnt really NEED many branching paths since the areas themselves are now IMMENSE: i got lost within DS3 areas way more than I ever did in the previous two entires. Areas are huge, vast playgrounds full of twists and turns, hidden rooms and caves, with a greater focus on vertical exploration. So in the end, although we'll miss the replayability value and feeling of agency that was lost by removing the old, web-like world map progression, the trade-off was necessary to receive these new wide-ranging more open Areas. A very much still missed feature is the amount of Estus flasks being linked to each specific bonfire, upgradable through use of Humanities in DS1. That mechanic granted players the agency to manage their resources to make each section a little easier, adding a captivating long-term layer of strategy and resource management. By comparison, the Embers raising HP in DS3 IS an interesting feature, but nothing exceptional. Going over to combat: the fights in DS3 have a much faster pace than previous entries, with your attacks being much quicker and enemies more aggressive and with longer combos. This isnt an improvement or a flaw per se, it is a change that will land differently on each player depending on personal preference, but this new speed of movement makes the roll an excessively powerful option, trivializing some (not that many) fights. The quality of the enemies themselves returns to the greatness of DS1, especially in regards of bosses. Unlike the lackluster, awkward bosses of DS2 (for the most part) or the mixed bag that was DS1, DS3 offers the overall highest quality array of bosses of the entire trilogy, with non-stop challenging, exciting bossfights that almost always offer something to test the player's reflexes and adaptability in satisfying ways, up until the credits roll. To face these enemies the game offers you, as per usual, a pleasantly rich selection of different weapons, with many different combo attack animations, to suit different playstyles, now with even specific abilities tied to each weapon expanding the replayability factor and personalized nature of the experience. Backstabs have been nerfed excessively, and some balancing issues are still present, but nothing as terrible as Magic in DS1. Another unpleasant return (at this point, sadly, a tradition) is the ability of the enemies' weapons to go through walls and obstacles, whereas the player's cannot. NPC Questlines have always been a charming and immersive way to give more weight to the player's journey. By witnessing the personal tragedies of some of the wandering personalities that inhabit this land, you learn more of the world and its history, or simply get entertained, moved and surprised through small little moments inbetween your own quest. DS3 is a return to form compared to the scarce and dull NPC Questlines of DS2, with many NPCs to meet and many stories to watch unfold. But unlike DS1, in DS3 the time windows and criterias to meet most of these NPCs are waaay to narrow and strict: as a result, players will miss out on 50% (if not more) of these encounters, and therefore entire Questlines, whereas DS1 was much more forgiving, giving plenty of time to meet most of these characters. Or, in other words: Dark Souls III is an excellent way to end the franchise. The world map is a lot less interconnected than it used to be back in the DS1 days, sadly, with a more streamlined progression, but the quality of Level Design within Areas themselves is higher than ever, and the more streamlined nature allows for a more precise difficulty curve. Bosses are almost all of extremely high quality, the best collection of the entire series. The more fast-paced combat rhythm gives the adventure a breath of fresh air compared to previous chapters, and it's best balancing of the series thus far (not perfect still). But some of the series' traditional flaws still refuse to die (like enemy strikes going through walls), while some new ones emerge (like an excessively generous roll that rewards roll-spam a little too much)",8,2022-06-05,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Dwideshrude1,"Let me preface this by saying, READ the user reviews. Theres bots, many saying the same thing, giving it a 10/10. Im not saying From did it, but I'm also Not saying they Didnt. Now, onto how this game was developed- They read all the hate Dark Souls 2 got for being boring lazy and easy, so they just said ""screw it"" and copy and pasted bloodborne enemies until its impossible to even move without 6 (of the same exact) enemies pushing you up against a corner. Just extremely lazy attempt at ""difficulty"", when 1 on 1, the enemies are easy as hell. Its just awful. You cant fight 3 bloodborne dogs and 3 enemies that can teleport and spam magic. Or any of the other examples of awful, literally unwinnable enemy placement. That isnt combat. Thats just lazy. Oh. And theres of course things you will never find unless you look them up on google (google -aka fromsofts excuse for a quest guide), but I **** you not, theres a weapon that you need to kill a boss, and there 0 way youd ever know how to use it without looking it up. Literally 0 indication of what to do, how to use it, anywhere in the game. You hold down L2 to use weapon skills right? Obvious. Great. But would you ever think to hold it down for SIX SECONDS WHEN THERE A BOSS RUNNING AT YOU? 6 S E C O ND S??? Thats just bad game design. You cant damage a MAINLINE BOSS unless you GUESS to hold down L2 for SIX SECONDS. (YOU DONT HAVE 6 seconds except for ooonnnneee moment in the fight) I mean cmon guys. Everyone knows that you cant excuse that. Oh. And when you beat that boss, you get teleported to the next one. Youd think, oh if I die, I'll just get to retry, right? hahahahahaha what are you, logical? This is Fromsoft. You die, and then get sent back to the last bonfire. So you go back to the boss room, and theres a bonfire **** where ****.... boss? Youknow? The one i just fought? Can i figure out where it is? Ask someone in the game surely? No. Oh. Its that bad, huh? I have to reach out to the ""Fromsoft Quest Guide( ****)"" oh, but nobody has actually played this far and there misinformation everywhere, nowhere can i find where to go. Lol but 10/10. Maybe play the game before going onto message boards to defend the indefensible. Speaking of indefensible- the input lag, queuing, and hitboxes. As we have seen more recently with the terrible dropped inputs and hitboxes of Sekiro, and the awful input queuing and dodge lag of Elden Ring, clearly whoever used to be in charge of making that aspect feel smooth just isnt at the company any more. It feels extremely clunky, and it only got worse when Elden Ring iterated upon it.This game was when it started to rear it's ugly head ot seems. And its a shame that their older games have better dodge mechanics and less input lag. Technology should improve. And there isnt an excuse. Another thing- Balancing and progression- a foreign term to this development team. I'm on the final boss and I just realized the **** stick with a couple nails sticking out of it (from the beginning of the game) is literally more powerful than any other weapon, whether from a Lord or not. That's not balancing. Sorry. You know what else is dumb? How for about 50% of the game, your best move is developing into the vitality stat, to up your equip load and damage negation, as every other stat has a crazy low first soft cap. It's almost as if they didnt play their own game lol So, anwyays, I beat this game. It felt extremely hollow, as the last boss is just completely down to RNG and input lag whether you can win, and I beat with a **** stick, since it was stronger than weapons enchanted with godly powers.

FuriousAegon,"Dark Souls 3 is the best part in the Trilogy. After completing DS2 I’ve diced to rewrite my old essays, and now I think DS3 is my favorite dark souls **** gameplay became much faster in-spite of the success of Bloodborne fast gameplay, when u don’t have any shields and u need to rely on your reflexes and make successful dodges.Because of that gameplay became skillful and action-based. There a lot of good bosses on the main game (Lothric and Lorain, Soul of Cinder, Abyss Watchers, Oldrich, Nameless King, Pontiff Sulyvahn ) that are really interesting and provide unique and good fight **** bosses from DLCs in most cases are great.Only Slave Knight Gael is one the best FromSoft bosses,lore,ost,location of this boss provides perfect experience to the player.Also there’s a Darkeater Midir, the Hardest Boss of DS3 ( for me ), also has very intense fight, good ost, awesome looking arena, and good lore and design of f boss gives a player fair and very hard **** same situation Sister Fiede and Father Ariandel **** this bosses are really good. Locations of the game are “next-level” comparing with DS2 and ds1, locations are interesting to explore and have well-build **** example of good level-design are Irythill the Boreal Valley - Anor Londo, Great Wall of Lothric, Ringed City, Achedragon Peak are my favorite ones from the game with DLC. The whole story is hugely connected with Dark Souls 1, and how Aldia Scholar of the first Sin once said that Gwyn made a First Sin linking the fire , and because of that the worlds of Dark Souls started **** the result of that we can see in the **** the stories of Lords of Cinder are really interesting especially Lothrics and Lorians.DLCs share one story, and it is as good as games story, the story of Gael and his Ladies Painting that will save every living being from this fading world is awfully interesting and really sad.When you witness last breaths of this world, and these last attempts to save only the people of this world, not the world itself is tearing me apart. I really like this game, for its lore, gameplay and DLCs but Bloodborne,Sekiro,Elden Ring I consider better ones that this **** it is still a really good game. 8.5/10",8,2022-03-25,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Axxypie,"Blood, sweat, tears & souls What a game! Probably the most freedom and difficulty I‘ve ever experienced in a videogame. It‘s presentation is also really beautiful (for the most part). It is not flawless though. Newcomers will struggle with most of the bosses and exploration. I really like the lack of a map; since that encourages exploration and a strong sense of orientation. This exact thing also lead to not really knowing where to go after a certain point; which was annoying. What I didnt like was the extreme difficulty spikes and drops with certain bosses. I understand its (for the most part) an open world game where different players encounter bosses at different times; but about 5 hours in, the boss-difficulty spikes through the f***ing roof; dropping immediately on the one that follows. Linearity in that case would‘ve considerably helped iron out the inconsistency.",9,2022-03-17,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Jollyolfun,"Dark Souls 3 is fun. Definitely. The souls series is known for being extremely difficult. But personally I find there is a disconnect between being tough and being fair in DS3. Although I beat every boss in the game, I can recognize why so many people think this game is too hard. For example the Farron Keep swamp at the beginning of the game. You are posioned, cannot run, and have many enemies who defy all geographical obstacles coming to kill you which they will as they have every advantage.

Yet amidst the misery and oppressive environments, you encounter those who continue their fight, who still seek purpose as the world crumbles around them. As the player, you too find yourself at the heart of that struggle and each triumph, no matter how small, registers significance. I fell head over heels for Dark Souls 3 not long after starting it. My top 3 favorite boss fights are in this game and I can still remember when I beat each of them for the first time. Nothing compares to the feeling of wielding a greataxe, donning heavy armor, and slaughtering everything that gets in your way.

joel_tdl,"El Souls Definitivo JUGABILIDAD: En este título, y por fin, la jugabilidad es rápida y fluida lo que en juegos anteriores no ocurría. Esto hace del gameplay mucho mas disfrutable y adictivo. La cantidad de armas, hechizos, milagros y piromancias parece aumentar. Aunque claro que hay muchos ""repetidos"" respecto a títulos anteriores, también hay muchos nuevos que le dan una ligera variedad a la jugabilidad. Además, los materiales para subir de nivel las armas (o imbuirlas) son mucho mas abundantes ésta vez por lo que podemos probar varias sin tener que elegir que una sola para llevarla al máximo poder. Por su parte, diseño de escenarios es excelente, superior a los anteriores y casi a la altura de Bloodborne. La interconexión es buena y la inmersión, sin abusar de las áreas a nivel de hacerlas laberínticas a lo ridículo, está bien lograda. El diseño de enemigos es un gran complemento y hacen match perfecto con dichas áreas. Eso sí, seguimos con los ya conocidos enemigos que hacen sus combos de 1989 golpes ininterrumpibles. Los jefes son memorables e infinitamente superiores a los vistos en Dark Souls II, no solo en diseño sino en moveset y arenas de combate. Además, aquí ya encontramos las transformaciones/segundas fases (como las vistas en Bloodborne) que hacen las batallas más complicadas e interesantes. Como siempre, podemos invocar ayuda de npc (menos rotos que los vistos en DS) u otros jugadores para ayudarnos, (gracias al que me ayudó contra el Pontífice Sulyvahn, se que no hice mucho, pero no lo habría logrado sin ti lol). Por lo demás, tenemos zonas ya vistas en DS y otras DEMASIADO similares a áreas del primer título, lo que claramente le quita un poco de mérito. GRÁFICOS: El primer Dark Souls que es bueno visualmente. El diseño y detalle de escenarios es sencillamente delicioso: las cinemáticas son muy buenas y la narrativa de las mismas es riquísima. el diseño de enemigos es muy bueno. ¿La cámara? Salvo cierto Boss en especifico, aquel montado en un ser alado, es funcional. Primer juego en la saga en que no pierdo por culpa de un mal diseño y funcionalidad de la cámara, o malos ángulos de visión (salvo el jefe ya mencionado). Por vez primera en la trilogía puedo decir que disfrute de VER el juego. SONIDO: Solo empezar la canción tema, antes incluso de dar el primer click, nos queda claro la altísima calidad de la banda sonora. Y es todo lo que tengo que decir al respecto... excepto que ese track de los Vigilantes del Abismo. Wow INNOVACIÓN: El agregado de dotar a las armas con habilidades o trucos definitivos es bueno. Pocas veces me aprecio útil in-game, pero se agradece. El gran aumento de ítems es también un buen valor pero, como ya dije, el juego peca de repetitivo con respecto a ciertos escenarios y el diseño de otros.",9,2022-02-08,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Huevos_il,"Este juego puede ser o muy bueno o muy malo, dependiendo del gusto personal del jugador. Sin embargo, no se puede negar que este juego tiene puntos fuertes y puntos flojos: Puntos negativos: Muchas veces y según la persona te puedes frustrar jugando a este juego, por ejemplo si te tiras 100 intentos contra un boss llamado La Bailarina del Valle Boreal o si por otro lado te tiras 41 intentos para saltar a una cornisa sin morir en el intento. Muchas mecánicas son frustrantes y aburridas, aunque depende del boss. El sistema online que viene activo por defecto es bastante innecesario debido a los mensajes trampa que te dejan el resto de jugadores y al sistema de invasiones en el que tú estás tan tranquilo yendo a x zona y te sale un tío de color rojo que te quiere matar, como si no tuvieras suficiente con los 8000 perros que se teletransportan a tu cara o a tu espalda a medida que huyes de ellos. Las misiones de personaje requieren consultar una guía, porque no son intuitivas en lo absoluto. Las pantallas de carga hacen la experiencia un tanto más lenta ya que te tienes que comer una cada vez que viajes o mueras, y por último, los gráficos no están del todo mal, pero podrían ser un poco mejores a la vista. Puntos positivos: La mayoría de los jefes molan un taco, hay zonas bonitas, el aspecto RPG está bien logrado, no es injusto, a medida que vas avanzando en el juego vas a ir aprendiendo y dominando mecánicas ya conocidas, cuando derrotas a un jefe en el que llevas tiempo atascado te produce una gran satisfacción, puedes usar varias builds, se te puede ir la cabeza e intentar cosas como una no-hit y la historia, aunque escondida, es bastante buena.",7,2022-01-02,PLAYSTATION 4,user

kurteSUS,"If you kill the woman that gives you the banner, across Vordt of the Borreal Valley a new boss will spawn called Dancer of the Boreall Valley. I highly reccomend u do this. Also the final boss is Lord of Cinder. Unkindled are failed Lords of Cinder, succeeding in linking the flame, but too weak to survive the burst of fire. Lords of Cinder cannot Link the Flame on their own, and all five are needed. The Lords of cinder have linked the fire long ago, but it still fades and it was deemed ""not enough"". The new order was to have all 5 of them link it again, this time together for a stronger sacrifice. Only Ludleth of Courland was willing to make the sacrifice. He had his legs removed should his will waver, as the first time he linked the fire must had been traumatic. No one else wants to link the flame. It might be that they barely survived the first time or it hurts like hell. The champion of ash, along with many other unkindled are awoken from death, possibly by the fire's call, to bring all mighty Lords back, dead or alive. Despite having served as the fuel for the First Flame for this long of a time the Lords of Cinder still retain a good amount of the fire within their body. This aspect in itself is somehow standing against the purpose of “sacrificing oneself to prolong the inevitable” as it implies that this power is taken from the already dying First Flame and thereby weakening it even further. This in fact could be the very reason the Player Character has to find the Lords of Cinder, slay them and thereby retake their souls to then feed them to the First Flame again by Linking it. The young prince Lothric is being called a Lord of Cinder, even though he is implied to have never actually linked the First Flame. He is also not shown to have any of the fire powers the other lords use in their second boss phase. All the fire attacks used are stemming from his older brothers sword (which got its effect from Demon fire)",10,2021-10-09,PLAYSTATION 4,user

alagharrr,"10/10. Фуух, вот и настало время Dark Souls 3, игра в которую я поиграл после Bloodborne, игры весьма схожи но и в то же время супер разные, но тут не будет сравнения бб и дс, а просто впечатления. Сюжет. Игры Миядзаки сана(Souls-Like) известны тем, что сюжет раскрывает для себя игрок сам, в соулсах сюжет простой(что не скажешь про лор) у тебя есть цель- собрать души мейн боссов в игре, чтобы возродить огонь, ну про сюжет в принципе сказать больше нечего(No Spoilers). Боевка. Одна из главных фишек соулсов- это боевка, убивать казуалов в дарк соулсе приятно, супер много оружия, за 2 нг насобирал более 120 уникальных экземпляров, понравилась прокачка оружия, есть несколько типов оружия которые качаются разными титанитами, так же присутствует магия, хотя я ей почти не пользовался так что сказать мне кроме того что есть много уникальных заклинаний нечего. :) Атмосфера. В плане атмосферы дарк соулс это очень крепкое произведения, чего только стоит Иритилл Холодной Долины. Боссы. Пройдя бб я подумал что в дс мне будет играть легче, от части это правда, но с другой стороны некоторые боссы в этой игре сложнее в разы чем в бб, стоит упомянуть: Танцовщица Холодной Долины ~20~ траев, Безымянный Король ~15 траев~, Братья Близнецы ~12 траев~.

You start of into your first playthrough dying dozens of times - and you will die over and over to new enemies, whose movement you have to learn. The game has great boss designs. A lot of variety for builds is given with the amount of weapons and armors in the game. The difficulty is just perfect - you wander on the edge of frustration but getting a bit further every time, seeing a little success keeps you going. So far I did a ton of NG+(++, ...) runs and the game still is fun. In a few spots the controlls can get a bit annoying, thats why I have to take one point away from a potential 10/10 and another point for the bugs I had to experience along the way (some of them can be really frustrating, if you bug out of the map and are not able to get your souls back, that you loose on death).

The lack of story told is cleverly construed within the items you find throughout the game and optional box storylines. The graphics are empirically better than DS 2 and the map design is flawless.

Environments offer great a great variety, from gorgeous snowy cities to underground secret labyrinths filled with ferocious creatures, each environment feels distinct from the other.

Not only that, these encounters are each accompanied by a magical soundtrack, making fighting these extraordinary foes even better.

Raios-Rogue,i rate this game 9.5 the only thing this game messed up is it allowed to much save scumming giving everything to your friend and than reloading your safe file online everybody is already maxed out at level 1 having the best gear because his friend gave him everything killing the entire reason to play this game and facing people in PVP that are super overpowered at the beginning life cycle of this game it was not like that PVP was so fun and i never liked that this game rewards straight swords to be the best weapons in PVP in the game fast weapons dominate when you hit somebody he is stunned and a second hit is guaranteed otherwise invasions are still fun PVP is still fun CO OP is still fun even if people throw a bunch of dookie pie and point down at you a 100 times when you lose A PVP match like it's a big deal that they won a PVP match it's not like we are playing for money on a tournament the DLC PVP arena was a good idea i enjoyed the ring city so much and loved it the ashes of ariandel was good too a bit short but the boss was worth it she was my most challenging boss out of all in DS3 because i steam rolled the entire game without using a shield which i am used to in bloodborne after all i am a soulsborne veteran i have 1000 hours in DS1 DS3 Bloodborne and 300 hours in DS2 and Sekiro the only game that i have missed playing is demon's souls remake which i am playing now on my PS5 and i have bested many people in PVP but it's not a big deal to me when i win or lose lol not a big deal at all like some people make it just have fun with the game that's what matters to me it also matters that i am improving my skills and pushing myself to the limit so i can get better at what i am playing and having fun at the same time the PVE aspect of this game is phenomenal one of the best boss designs out there with bloodborne sekiro Devil may cry 5 special edition Nioh 2 the weapon arts where a great addition to the game making the combat a lot better all the ncps where great the story the narrative was good the weapons fashion choices armor sets are really good my favorite weapon is the paired ringed knight greatswords that they nerfed to oblivion the best part of this game are the boss fights in my opinion and you get 60fps on PlayStation 5 via backwards compatiblity,9,2021-01-31,PLAYSTATION 4,user

ToPlays,"Incredible game with an incredible history and universe, in my first time playing, I played 6 hours in a row, and I don't had realized the time passing, the difficulty can make you be stucked in the same boss per 6 hours, that maked me spent 60 hours completing it, and 20 hours in the DLCs, for me, that's the best game I had ever played, it has good controls and a lore told by the itens descriptions and the scenario, making you really need to search for the lore in the game or in internet, but, the camera is the worst thing in the game, sometimes I falled in cliffs cause of the camera turning to the side. The negative points are: the camera, the teleport between bonfires(checkpoints) makes the game easier and bonfires(checkpoints) positions don't make sense sometimes.

There is a wide variety of content in the core game, more than what you get from other game developers. The music is so-so in whole, with some very memorable tracks in part.

Although the combat is different and not as style as Bloodborne, it;s still pretty amazing. The bosses are so **** cool and hard which make the game so fun to play.

Intenselime,"There is not a lot to be said about DS3 that hasn't been said already. The game is a visual masterpiece and the gameplay is intense. It also features some of the most grandiose boss fights you can get in modern AAA gaming. I do feel as though some of the level designs and areas are a bit less inspired than previous entries (DS1 & BB still being the better contenders for 10/10, ""best in the series"" spots) and the frame pacing issues are still somewhat present on console (though not as bad as bloodborne) but once you get used to it, the game's performance is serviceable and runs well. I actually found many of the areas in-between boss fights to be more challenging than the bosses themselves which was the opposite of my experience in DS1 (the only other souls game I had played prior to DS3). Having played BB since, I can see why some may have felt as though there were too many similarities between the two, but to be honest I think DS3 does a fantastic job at remain true to the soul ""spirit"" in its art direction, character cameos and gameplay to be an amazing game in its own right. If you are a fan of fast-paced, challenging yet rewarding gameplay and somehow have still not yet played the Sekiro/Soulsborne series, DS3 is simply put an absolute must buy!",9,2020-12-11,PLAYSTATION 4,user

UmCarinha,"Dark souls 3 é a minha quarta experiência em jogos da From software depois de Demon's souls, Dark souls 1 e 2 e está é minha análise: Gráficos: Graficamente o jogo deixa a desejar, especialmente pelo ano em que o jogo foi lançado (2016). Veja, o jogo não é feio, no entanto ele é inferior graficamente a Bloodborne que foi lançado 1 ano antes e mais ainda a outros jogos triple A da época e a desculpa de que bloodborne é somente de uma plataforma enquanto DS3 está em 3, não é aceitável, visto que tem muito jogo multiplataforma bastante bonito. Além disso no PS4, o jogo está lotado de Pop In e o cenário as vezes demora para carregar. Nota 7 para os gráficos Ambientação: A ambientação é bastante interessante com bastante variação de cenário, nisso eu não tenho a reclamar, a from foi bem nessa parte, nota 9. Gameplay: A gameplay é a mesma velha gameplay de DS1 e isso é bom, com a adição de movimentos especiais de cada arma a gameplay no modo offline ficou mais interessante, no entanto no modo online esses movimentos especiais tirou muita habilidade dos jogadores, basta apenas escolher uma arma com um especial forte, apertar L2 e pronto, vc venceu o PvP... O pior de tudo são os malditos lags, o ataque de seu oponente passa a 4 metros de distância e mesmo assim você sofre o dano, isso é ridículo, além disso o jogo está lotado de Glitch e a desenvolvedora parece não se importar com isso. Por conta do modo online eu terei que dá somente nota 6,5 para a gameplay. Bossfighter: DS3 tem as melhores bossfighter da franquia e são bastante divertidos os Boss tem uma grande variedade de movimento o que me trouxe bastante diversão e rage rsrsrs. Nota 8.5 Trilha sonora: Acho que o DS3 tem a melhor trilha sonora da franquia, o que deixa ainda mais divertido a luta contra os bosses, realmente acertaram nesse quesito.

DKR,"I loved, loved, LOVED DS1. After several ragequits, something about it settled into my heart as a flawed masterpiece....eventually. No matter my hatred for its excessively punishing respawns, DS1 had a great charm to it from its lore, fantasy world, and OUTSTANDING level design. It was dark, somber, but somehow, beautiful, like its ending theme song (youtube Nameless Song ost). Seriously, this team has some amazing imagination. It earned the name ""genre-defining"". DS3 had big shoes to fill, and missed it. The one thing that immediately turned me off was the input delay. C'mon, folks: it's 2020, this shouldn't be an issue anymore. From swinging your weapon, to casting a spell, to most unforgivable of all: DODGE ROLLING. When you press O to dodge, there's a .5s delay until you roll. That alone broke the game for me and made it unplayable. In DS1, my style THRIVED off of wearing minimal gear, but out-maneuvering my target. The enemy attacks are sometimes super fast, so it rewarded reflexive dodging. I could beat most bosses naked! DS3, you wear heavy equipment in every slot, bc nothing else is viable. There's also no 3 levels to movement speed. You're either under-weight, or overweight. There's also some research that suggests leaving a single slot open largely increases the damage you take. The death system also feels dated. Dying, respawning, and running to where you were gets obnoxiously tedious. Combine that with the numerous OHK's plastering the world or losing your precious currency AGAIN, and you often feel more like you're running on a treadmill. 75% of your game time will be fighting the same enemies over the same stretch of land again and again and again and again bc your roll delays, you're stunlocked, and back to spawn. Worse yet is this punishes you for exploring. Why wander off the path just to be OHK then lose everything? Eventually, you'll just run straight for bonfires bc the combat isn't fun anymore. What's supposed to make this better is summoning others into coop, but they STILL haven't fixed another issue: invasions. Look, if I want to fight a no-life 16 yr old thats spend 1,000 hours perfecting his toon's stats, gear, spells, and every cheap kill on the map, I would say so, but I don't. I want to play COOP: THAT MEANS ME, WITH ONE PERSON ON MY TEAM, VS THE GAME. There's no option to tell these no-lifers to f*** off and LET ME PLAY THE GAME. Once you're invaded, you might as well just turn off your console, bc you won't have a prayer against the no-lifers. Even if you've done all you can to empower your toon, the invader is at least 5x stronger than you in every way, and has about 30 hp potions to your 5 or so. Even if you DO get the upper hand with some outplays, they'll just roll, roll, roll, roll, drink a pot to full hp, then come back, rinse and repeat as necessary until they exhaust all your options. WORST OF ALL, all these ppl do with their lives is sit here, afk in a video game, waiting to invade someone, so you'll find that same kid again and again and again until you burn out your resource used to summon help. Don't EVEN get me started on how buggy, laggy, and sloppy the pvp is, which means even pvp **** guessed it: a huge waste of time. Another beef I have is how DS3 is sooo cryptic, that unless you have the wiki open next to you, you're going to miss 90% of the content. Getting NPC's to join you is waaaay too complicated, the weapon upgrade system isn't explained, the backstabs system is WHOOOOOOO wtffffffff? NOTHING is explained to you. AT. ALL. You have to do so much research, it feels more like school homework. So much time is wasted researching and reading. The game is way too meaty with you chewing and chewing and chewing, through meaty layer after meaty layer of research, respawning, dying, getting invaded, researching, dying, (ofc most of those deaths being the controls or glitches) and never ever getting anywhere. Before you know it, you've spent 10hrs dying, researching, and fighting off an invader b4 you've even seen the 2nd boss, not enjoy a moment of it, and eventually conclude: you'd rather be playing something else. DS3 is nothing but a huge, empty, waste of time. If you have absolutely nothing to do, if you are obsessively competitive, unemployed, or if you can't function w/o bragging and mocking someone, if you get off on tormenting ppl that can't defend themselves and cuss you out, or any of the above, this is your game. I'll leave you with a conversation I had with a DS fanboy that couldn't let criticism of his golden cow go unshamed: ""I have np with the game. You're just bad. Gid gud. I got all the achievements."" ""I got a job.""",3,2020-10-22,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Everything just moves too damn fast to my liking. The co-op is okay. It feels really difficult to find embers in DS3 which allows you to summon other players.

Red-Eyes,"In an industry plagued with microtransactions, mediocre open-world games and bribed critic reviewers commanded by the likes of EA, Activision and the likes I feel FROM Software is some sort of Batman to give us at least some hope, and again they deliver the goods with Dark Souls 3. The combat is the absolute best, you can't ask for something better than this. Attacking, managing stamina and dodging at the precise time are a gaming art as the punishment for being overconfident is right around the corner. Bosses aren't as memorable as in Souls 1 but they are still good (my highlight is the Nameless King, visually, lorewise and the fight itself) in the main game and astronomically awesome in the DLCs (Midir, Friede and Gael). Changing builds add a lot of replayability because a section that is easy for a caster maybe harder for a melee and vice-versa. You can respec your status 5 times per playthrough so if you don't feel like going to NG+ with the same guy, just change your build before going. The online system is the same from other games however now you can summon 3 guys to co-op. Being ganked by 4 dudes when invading is not the greatest thing in the world and if you don't have an insane ability (mastering spacing and parrying to the fullest besides pivot and rolling back-stabbing) and patience you're gonna die and get frustrted. But you can always play at certain soul levels to avoid ganks (they are rarer at SL60 for example and it is a popular level for PvP) or just jump straight into the arena for a one-on-one honorable duel. Anyway, this is just what you would expect form a Dark Souls game and although some might say it doesn't reinvent the wheel, I'd argue that the execution is so perfect that they don't have to push boundaries (besides you can always check Sekiro or Bloodborne for a ""different Dark Souls tone""). Beating a hard boss after trying for hours by memorizing their combos and exploring their weaknesses it is still the best thing one can experience in a video game; the feeling of getting better and overcoming a hard obstacle not because your character is stronger but because you, the player, became stronger is still done perfectly",10,2020-10-07,PLAYSTATION 4,user

AlexvaderII,"Dark Souls III es el magnifico cierre de la saga y evoluciona en los combates ya que se sienten mas fluidos y cuenta siempre con un gran combate estratégico en el cual tendremos que enfrentar enemigos difíciles pero mas dinámicos que en las entregas anteriores porque se siente que peleas contra alguien con un comportamiento mas variado aquí se mejoro la IA. Desde el inicio hay que ir con cuidado para no morir aunque si morimos no hay problema este es un juego de probar nuevas maneras de afrontar el reto como en las anteriores entregas. La ambientación y diseño de niveles vuelve a ser importante y se corrigieron errores cometidos en la segunda entrega. Hay gran cantidad de enemigos y todos son diferentes y agresivos pero tendremos una gran variedad de escudos para protegernos y armas que podremos mejorar bastante y de diferentes maneras para que las adecuemos según creamos que sea lo mejor para derrotar a tal enemigo. Adicionalmente obtendremos hechizos y piromancias que básicamente lo resumo en magia estos se obtienen de diferentes maneras los mas fáciles son de pago con almas dentro del juego pero serán los mas básicos, al final de cuentas esto hará los combates muy divertidos y variados. Algo que hace especial a este juego es que desde que encontremos nuestro primer ítem nos revelara partes de la historia del juego como un gigantesco rompecabezas, ya que la misma se narra atreves de los NPC´s que nos encontremos en el camino las pocas cinematicas y los ítems así que aquí todo es importante. En resumen tenemos un juego solido con grandes combates finales, gran historia y ambientación, divertido a mas no poder, y con componentes online que mejoran al original ya que podremos encontrar a nuestros amigos de una manera mas fácil y como siempre podemos ayudar a jugadores que ni siquiera conocemos o podremos estropearle la aventura a otros jugadores invadiéndolos y estropeando su avance, esto se escucha sencillo pero hay unos ""PACTOS"" que haremos dentro del juego con NPC´s que nos darán recompensas según lo que decidamos hacer o ayudar o eliminar a la persona online. Conclucion: Dark Souls III esta a la altura de la primera entrega y es un gran cierre para la saga.",10,2020-09-16,PLAYSTATION 4,user

memokmo,+ Great combat with new weapon arts + Epic and challenging bosses with best soundtracks + Large content and DLCs are excellent - There are so few interesting areas.

Keitha313,"The worst of the Dark Souls game to put it in sbort imagine you have a winning formula and you decide to trash it to appeal to a casual market i.e. Call of duty and Fortnite crowd... THIS IS WHAT DARK SOULS 3 IS!! I'm not going to go into too much details ill give you all tje maom points why you shoulsm't buy the game. The pacing of the game caters to a casual low IQ audience who can't deal with real timing. The gameplay is essentially just a boring hack and slash. Constant roll spam, the roll spam goes unpunished because what it takes to roll is minimal in stamina department therefore gameplay is very lacklustre. Just forgetable dodve dodge dodge dodge Boss fights are incredibly easy no challenge at all Honestly im telling you this game isnt worth getting its a massive downgrade on DS1. The high positive scores are fake bots casual souls fans who didnt play the original.",5,2020-09-05,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The difficulty is just right however, some players will find it difficult as there is no hand holding beyond the basic controls. Each enemy is unique with stellar boss fights that get your blood pumping. Each death in this game is a fair death, you just **** up. The visuals might not be the best however the detail put into the game negates all visual complaints. The soundtrack for this game is one of the best I've ever heard right alongside Bloodborne.

MasterMoonfire,"After the disappointment that was Dark Souls II, I was sort of skeptical about if Dark Souls III would deliver on its promise, but after enough encouragement I decided to give it a try, and after playing through the game, I realized how amazing and kick-ass this game was. Not only did Dark Souls III fix most of the problems the second game had, but it also has the best combat system in the entire Souls series, though it was still missing something that made the first game a masterpiece. Simply put, not as good as the first but a lot better than the second game and is a great addition and a satisfying conclusion to the Souls series. Dark Souls III is the best game of 2016 and is definitely a must play if you're a real Souls fan.",9,2020-08-29,PLAYSTATION 4,user
JD1872,"The thing that stops this being a much better game is the poor design of the bosses, they would have been better making the game a bit shorter and focusing on maintaining the quality level. The DS series prides itself on tough but fair skill levels but some of the later bosses seem a bit cheap, focusing on trying to make it so you can’t heal while one wrong move and they one shot you or you are spending half your time trying to fight the controls where you can’t lock on. Maybe my issue was playing Bloodborne first which is a much better overall game with better bosses, combat and much more satisfying weapons. DS3 seems slow and frustrating in comparison, I spend the last half of the game wishing it would end",7,2020-08-28,PLAYSTATION 4,user

I told myself I would try a dark souls game and it was either dark souls 3 or remastered so I chose this one. I was aware of the difficult gameplay but I didn’t know how similar to bloodborne it was going to be. I was pleasantly surprised that it’s very different in a good way. They’re both hard in gameplay but they both have very different mechanics. I like the weapon system better in bloodborne but that’s just me. I beat the game and got through both DLCs and now I’m on NG+. This game is really fun and I enjoyed the PVP system. The boss fights seem a lot easier than what I expected.

Bosses just went too far with having up to three phases and being more of a fight to reserve resources than defeat by combat. The Ringed City DLC is surprisingly recycled and many assets are just fixed into it from previous sequels. Even just got old enemies in. It's clear they have run out of ideas and funnily enough they have announced that they do need to move away from dark souls.

Sus1216,"Después del bodrio que supuso para mi Dark Souls II, tenía muchas esperanzas en la tercera parte. Bueno, pues el resultado fue mucho mejor y casi al nivel del primero. La fórmula es la misma. La historia no se cuenta de una forma narrativa, la vas descubriendo a través de diálogos con los personajes del mundo y los diferentes objetos. La idea básica la sabes, sigues un hueco que tiene una misión: avivar la llama del mundo que se está apagando, si no el mundo se sumirá en la oscuridad. Podemos personalizar a nuestro personaje con un editor más complejo que en los anteriores juegos y elegir una clase. A partir de aquí es avanzar por los escenarios eliminando enemigos y consiguiendo sus almas para así subir de nivel. Conforme vayamos subiendo de nivel, podremos llevar ciertas magias o armas más potentes y pesadas. Los enemigos te pueden aniquilar en un par de golpes si no tenemos cuidado. A esto hay que sumarle el plataformeo en algunas zonas y, por supuesto, los jefes que ponen al jugador en un aprieto por su exigencia. Dark Souls III es un juego exigente en ciertos puntos que requiere habilidad por parte del jugador. Dado que es el tercero de los Souls, se nota la mejoría en el manejo de nuestro personaje. Es más rápido y más ágil. A nivel visual y artístico, los personajes, enemigos y escenarios son muy buenos. Se nota que es un juego de esta generación. Un muy buen juego que si quieres un desafío, debes jugarlo.",8,2020-07-16,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Vaeu,"My first experience with Dark Souls was Dark Souls II. I don't remember much of my time with it as I was rather young, but I didn't play much of it as I wasn't technically ready to play it. I was naïve then, but there was something that drew me to Dark Souls that made me pick up Dark Souls III - it was the challenge. Therefore, I believe that Dark Souls III is my first true Souls game, and it was spectacular. The challenge was extremely fun to overcome, and the medieval dark fantasy aesthetic along with the glorious music helped to immerse me into the world and the boss fights. There was a tragic beauty with the characters you meet and with the character you play.

The soundtrack is easily one of the best of the last years and the general sounds of the game are inmersive and very scary sometimes. The levels are made in a great way, so you feel rewarded when reaching a new area. The bosses are, at least most of them, very dynamic, fluid and tough. Maybe there are a couple of bosses that are just too easy to kill. The game also lacks of better mechanics when talking about replaying it. After you beat it and go for the New Game + it just feels more of the same. It's a great game of this generation, and maybe the best of the trilogy.

Shukri,"When reviewers know that a certain game is a best seller, or an instant internet sensation, they no longer write reviews, they simply hedge our bets. That's the syndrome of which Dark Souls is afflicted. You will hear people say that ""this is a hard game"" or ""git gud"", is it hard for the right reasons though? That is almost never discussed, or if it has been, I've certainly missed it before I made my purchase. Put simply, Dark Souls is a PS1 generation game, with the graphics of a current generation game. In fact, not even up there, but I do bet that without the graphics advantage, you would never tell this apart from a PS1 port as far as mechanics go. In another way, if the main character of one of your most favorite action RPG's was yourself instead of the main protagonist, and you mastered no martial arts, that's also Dark Souls. Proof enough, you make your own character, so he/she could very well be a stick figure for all we care. It's almost never a good strategy to rely on your reaction time, or your skill set (which technically there is none), or even try to find an efficient, cool-looking way around this game. Why are there even enemies that die with one hit!? Dark Souls plays like a horror ride from an amusement park, I get the appeal in that, but it's not an ""action"" RPG, it's... a very dated, wasn't released before, refurbished, old generation game, where the combat mechanics are as simple, and as brutally punishing, as poking an enemy's hitbox in whichever way or form and moving away.

The worst game in the world because this game is too difficult to fight. Just one hit from the boss then I died. What is the purpose to make a game such like I hit a boss that it will dodge my attack. Then when it attack me and I just one hit die? I really so angry and want to throw the controller.

Like Bloodborne, this is very much a thinking man's game.

Gamer1465,"Dark souls 3 is my fourth favorite Soulsbourne game (Bloodborne, Dark Souls, Sekiro before it), but that doesn't mean this game isn't amazing. This game starts of at the Cemetery of Ash after finding out you need to bring down the four lords of cinder to link the first flame.... just like the previous two games, sure it lacks originality but it has the second best souls game bosses almost topping Bloodborne. The bossfights are epic, apart from a few I had my mouth open meeting these bosses like twin princes and Pontiff and the soundtracks with them are amazing and epic. I never got bored throughout my play-through and loved some of the areas although some are boring and bland. The NPC quest are great as well although I didn't complete them all. By the end you will feel satisfied with this being the last dark souls game no matter which of the four endings you get. Ashes of Ariandel is a fine DLC which sadly doesn't go longer than I hoped for and one of the worst bosses in the souls series with the gravetender. But you will forget all the disappointing elements because you get to verse one of the best bosses in the series in Sister Friede and holy crap this fight is tough but intense, I love it. The Ringed City is a massive improvement over the first DLC and is actually almost flawless, I love the journey to the ringed city and all but one boss in the DLC which is Darkeater Midir (just because he is tanky and a hard hitter), but once again you reach the end to fight the perfect boss Gael, a reflection of yourself, trust me when you fight him you will be mouth wide open the entire time. I can't recommend this game to everyone but if you want to try a dark souls game that is known for boss fights, this is the one I recommend. All souls fans will of played this game and I can see why it is arguably one of the best.",9,2019-11-11,PLAYSTATION 4,user

jiorl,"This is still a great game, and is a must play in general, let alone if you are a soulsborne fan. However, i just felt that while i certainly liked this game, it felt a bit too samey to the original. I think more new gameplay ideas could have been added/explored, as well as new storytelling ideas. The areas too are quite similar i.e. swamps, decrepid towns, archives. I will say though the game aesthetically looks really good, and really helps shape the world. The bosses are really cool, however their difficulty is a little bit too easy overall. Don't get me wrong - nameless king, prince lothric, champion gundyr, the pontiff are all challenging bosses but the rest of them are fairly straightforward (maybe its just cause i have played other souls games). The difficulty arc though is better than ds1, progressing very well. DS2 while it certainly had its faults - as you can see in my review of it - made me feel a big sense of adventure, traversing through its many landscapes and killing its many bosses (while DS3 hasn't given me that same feeling) , and in general is an underrated game. Overall DS3 is a great game, but just lacks the originality of the first game, and isn't as grand of an adventure as ds2 for mine.",7,2019-08-27,PLAYSTATION 4,user

FarhadSurd,"A masterpiece The main criticism of Dark Souls III is that its world isn't as encapsulating and flexible as past Soulsborne games. Apart from a handful of branches that lead to dead-ends, the path is laid before you in a rather straightforward manner. While the environments aren't lifted straight from past Souls games, they go through the gamut of washed-out castles, temples, forests, and sewers in an inoffensive but ordinary way. On a better front, if the sky for the final boss fight isn't an homage to the Berserk manga (I would link a picture, but I don't want to ruin anything), I don't know what is.

KingVilla1n,"Конечно, из-за возвращения Миядзаки, чувствуется и возвращение той самой мрачной атмосферы, за которую все и полюбили Dark Souls. После концептуального провала Dark Souls 2 от Юи Танимуры, Dark Souls 3 действительно выглядит внушительно и более талантливо. Однако, присмотревшись пристальней, уже можно заметить зияющую дыру творческого кризиса серии. Не просто так, после релиза игры, Миядзаки стал заявлять во всех интервью, что с Dark Souls покончено и если Namco и потребует еще одно продолжение, то оно уже точно будет не от него. Фансервис, куча великолепного вырезанного контента (бой Оцейроса с применением младенца или появление первородных змеев Кааса и Фрамтпа), невнятные попытки высмеивания христианства в лоре (Dark Souls скатывающийся в социальную сатиру с жирными ангелами и узурпацией Анор Лондо Понтификом и попами), и многое другое обесценили Dark Souls 3 и сделали его неким фантомом, пустой вспышкой, которая ничего в себе не несет.

ZXSth,"To praise Dark Souls as a series seems to be akin to noticing that grass is green. However, the praise isn't undue - this is an absolutely gripping game once you're able to get past the admittedly steep learning curve. I played this game after completing the first Dark Souls game, and was nearly alienated from the game by the speedier combat and change in camera angle. And like many have, I felt an urge to quit. But, as many have discovered before me, pushing past the spikes in difficulty led to a feeling of great accomplishment and an incomparable experience. Whereas its predecessors were arguably even less accessible and obtuse, Dark Souls 3 goes back to the basics of the first game, yet improves and streamlines so many features without sacrificing the series' essence. Moreover, the game is still phenomenally difficult, but allows skilled players to potentially succeed on their first try at a boss. And what's more, these bosses are entirely engaging even when they aren't insanely hard to beat. Yet for the masochists among masochists out there, the DLC bosses (especially those from The Ringed City DLC) dial the difficulty up to outrageous levels - from my experience, Darkeater Midir in particular proved to be a near-insurmountable challenge at first. The sound design, music, performance and gameplay and just about every detail in this game is fantastic. And while Dark Souls 3 is not for everyone (as the initial barrier to entry can seem quite high due to its difficulty), those who push through will see why this game has amassed such a devoted fanbase. This one is easily my favourite of the 3 Dark Souls games, and I can't help but recommend that anyone who's ever enjoyed fantasy action RPGs give this game a shot.",9,2019-03-30,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Richard1766,"Before writing a review, I want to say that I did not play Dark Souls, Dark Souls II and Demon Souls, but I will definitely pass them. I got into this game through the wonderful Bloodborne. Let's start with the design level. I liked him less than in BloodBorne. In BloodBorne, locations are much more connected and felt as a whole, this is especially felt when there you can go half way through the game to the very beginning. In dark souls this is much less. The game itself is quite beautiful. Locations are different, beautiful and interesting. Bosses. In the original game, bosses are worse than in dlc. Practicing with BloodBorne for From Software is the norm. The design of the bosses is good, the bosses are memorable and interesting. Complexity in the game is much higher than in Bloodborne. This is especially reflected in the DLC. Gameplay this game is much better than Bloodborne Here you can go through the game as a magician, there is a huge amount of different spells that I haven’t understood yet, I will do this further in the second pass. Also here you can go pyromance, etc. With this variety, the game is fascinating. But for me personally, the game is not as strongly hooked as bloodborne, the music and locations are good here, but worse than in bloodborne, and so can be said about a lot of things. I advise the game to absolutely everyone, it is excellent.",9,2019-01-31,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Gamesearcher1,"Well, if there was a best first impression award to any game, I wouldn’t even need to think about which game deserved it. From the get-go this game tells you that it’s going to be fair to you, but also make you want to destroy everything you can in a ten metre radius. But just writing this game off as hard would be doing the genius work a massive disservice. For this game is difficult, punishing and unrelenting for all the right reasons. The bosses all have fast, but predictable move-sets, and the true art of the game is recognising this and using an enemy’s weakness to your advantage. Secrets are also littered all throughout the depressing world that Dark Souls III takes place in, some rewarding you with unique weapons, others with terrifying beasts that are true pains to defeat, and even entire levels ripe with enemies and unique bosses are held as secrets.. I love that they incorporated some of the speed from Bloodborne into the game, although not as much. It shows in the enemies, some of which are incredibly fast, requiring you to dodge, parry and fat-roll to even stand a chance. The sheer number of weapons also never fails to astound me, as even in very specific groups such as Great-Hammers, there are still plenty of weapons there. Every build, from a swift person who wears rags and jumps around with a dagger, to a fat tank that takes very little damage from anything, but dishes out a giant amount, is viable, although some might be better suited other situations. But, alas, in a game that puts such and emphasis on bosses, just one boss fight can drag the game down quickly. And I found this out with the penultimate boss, who was an absolute annoyance to fight. But one thing that this game does miles better than anything else on the market, is the music. The melancholy soundtrack is based around a choir and stringed instruments, while some scores experiment with brass and bells. Even from the main screen, you understand very clearly that the game is going to posses an amazing soundtrack, and Dark Souls III doesn’t disappoint in this front at all. In fact, I’d go as far to say this is the greatest soundtrack to emerge out of gaming. Yes, I said it, and it’s not meant to be exaggeration. I mean it. The graphics are up next, and I can’t help but say this game looks quite nice. The backdrops of some locations can just look drop-dead gorgeous, while some things are just not pleasant to the eyes whatsoever. The colour scheme is also sadly limited to, for eighty percent of the game’s length, grey, brown, black, red and yellow. And, yes, I acknowledge the fact that this is meant to symbolise the atmosphere of gloom and dread, and it does make other locations stand out, but the abstinence of another less other than its pallet can drag down the experience. The lore in this game, and really in any modern From Software RPG, is cryptic at best, and hard to understand, but the main premise that you, the Ashen One, must kill all Lords of Cinder to keep a fire alight, prolonging the Age of Fire, and keeping the world from becoming darker than it already is. As with bugs, I’ve encountered none, except one extremely frustrating crash, in one of the most loathed areas in the entire series, that deleted not only the character I was playing as, but also every single other character. Aside from these gripes, Dark Souls III will not be forgotten by me for years to come. Its fast paced combat, that includes hundreds of various weapons and shields, its unforgettable bosses that made me run around the house like a madman and its incredible approach to level design. This is the end of the Souls series, and what better way to end a series than making a masterpiece?",10,2018-12-07,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Irisen,"Probably one of my favourite games of all time. The level-design is amazing, the combat system is fast-paced and challenging, the visuals are great and the music is a delight. I absolutely love the bosses available both in the game and in the DLCs (Gael remains my fave boss in any game ever) and the rush you feel when you finally defeat one after struggling is the best thing ever. The game also has a good replayability, with the NG+ system and the many different builds you can use, as well as the endings you can aim for. The side quests are interesting and fun, and the optional bosses are both challenging and a great surprise when you come across them. Anyways, Dark Souls' great.",10,2018-12-06,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Q_C,"You Died.. I saw those words on my screen Seventy-Eight times in time playing Dark Souls 3. As much as I thought I wasn’t going to enjoy my experience playing this game, I have to say I’m pretty proud of my performance in this game. That’s not to say this game isn’t difficult, it’s very VERY difficult. You will die a lot if you don’t respect the game; my advice, take it slow, check everything, and attack every chest… Mimics are stupid. The game gave me a lot of reasons to both love and hate it. It felt like every time I took a moment to breath in the games incredible atmosphere, it would swiftly remind me why I don’t ever want to play it again. I would look up at the beautifully rendered landscape and go “wow, this is incredible”. And then just a few steps later would be cursing and screaming at From Software for dropping a huge were-beast at me that I instantly had to figure out how to kill or.. Welp, I’m dead again. By far my favorite part of the game was the boss battles. Holy God the Boss Battles made me want to continue playing despite how much I hate the sloggy grind between bonfires. Grinding is easiest before the Lord of Cinders “The Abyss Watchers” and “Lothic” both of those bosses have a bonfire right outside their arena that have high souls, nearly 1v1 fights that you can grind for days. The game has many memorable moments. Unfortunately most of them stem from the amount of BS moves or groups of enemies you have to learn to maneuver around and slay. I just used a bow to get groups to come fight me one at a time. Dark Souls 3 has an amazing Replayability structure. I have a theory on something I like to call “The Barrier of Entry for JRPGs” Think of your favorite JRPG game, each of them have a very slow first hour at least. They have to build a story and they have to get you immersed enough to be invested to play it all. But that barrier also keeps certain gamers who couldn’t stomach the barrier of entry and gave up on the game before it got good. Dark Souls is the most Western Influenced JRPG ever made. It practically is a Western RPG, it just happens to come from Japan. But where Skyrim lets you have free reign after your first fifthteen minutes, Dark Souls has a barrier of 90 minutes. After you get through the Highwall of Lorthic and beat the boss after holding up the banner. That’s when the game clicked for me. Getting the taste of another boss I wanted to fight a third and then a fourth, and eventually I had beaten the game because I was looking for another boss fight. I just wanted to fight another boss. Dark Souls was actually a fine experience. I didn’t love this game fully, but I loved it enough to continue playing it. I won’t say I love this game, but I defiantly left this experience with a new respect to the boys at From. Now please don’t give me another one of their games ever again!

Denitriox,"When we talk about dark souls, your difficulty immediately comes to mind. and this dark souls 3 is in my opinion the easiest of the 3 and Bloodborne (with the exception of the DLCs) but removing that the videogame is very good. the gameplay changes a lot with respect to the first Dark souls, our character is much more agile and faster, and it shows a lot if we come from Dark souls 1 or 2, as for Lore, follow the story of Dark Souls 1 and the rest you discover your haha The bosses are very epic and the soundtrack that accompanies them is magnificent.

The bosses are not as hard as in Dark Souls 1 and 2, but they are still a challenging, especially for new player. you can finish the game in a 10 house or so or if you aren't very skilled then it could take you 50 or 60 hours maybe.

When the remastered version of the first game came I out, I decided to give in and give it a try. The last six weeks I played through all three games, all of the DLC, every optional boss - everything. Then I started Bloodborne and was surprised how bad it was, but that is another story. So give the game a try. It's not that hard, it's just not easy. Expect spending a few hours on the Internet, looking up the backstories of some of the character, or get some things explained that are not that clear.

Cells_R_Dead,"The soul series are my real favorites when it comes to bash & grind games. It has all the ingredients to be the best of the bunch. The graphics are superb and the action makes you sweat and gasp for air. The last time i felt so much excitement for a game was when i played through the Resident evil series. Or when the Zombie showed up in RE1 for the first time. That was a long time ago. I have a lot of games and a spend a lot of money on games as well. Im no smoker or drinker. I don't fancy cars or other luxury items as well. My drug is games and movies pure and simple. So i would see myself as a casual / hardcore gamer and movie-fan. I know what i want in a game when im looking to purchase. And there are many that i would not have bought if there was a demo at hand. But if you have played Demon Souls, Dark Souls, I or II, or even Bloodborne. You will NOT be disappointed with DS III. Its right on par with those before. And only games from Bandai / Namco can challenge them!. If you want hours of excitement, feeling strained and fatigued. This game is for you. 10/10",10,2018-08-07,PLAYSTATION 4,user
therdre,"While this installment of Dark Souls has taken a few steps in the right direction, it still falls utterly flat. While the combat has a bit more fluidity to it than Dark Souls 2 it feels more stiff and unresponsive than Bloodborne and still has a jankiness to it. The combat seems to be meant to be slow paced (and everything I've read agrees with that) but there is a strange delay to the combat actions that is present in all games that I imagine stems from an issue with the engine From Software uses for the games. While the atmosphere and look of the levels, armor and bosses is generally good to excellent the graphics seem like last gen. This wouldn't be an issue but even with low grade graphics the engine still has FPS issues in certain places. Also while this is heralded as a ""difficult"" franchise it still does not even deliver on that promise. It's a marketing tactic used to sell a glitchy and low effort project. Why would From Software bother to develop a proper working combat system, current generation graphics, a cohesive and well-told story (sorry the off hands approach in the fashion they use doesn't work and whats there is uninteresting at best), a proper RPG leveling system and progression, bug fixing and any other thing that would be included in a well-developed game that focuses on quality when the game will sell with the bare-minimum effort put in.

Also, I honestly prefer DS I and II's slower gameplay style to the more aggressive style of DS III; I think this aggressive style works in Bloodborne, but a lot of the tension is taken away from DS III when I can just roll 15 times away to safety.

knuckle,"Sechs Jahre nach Demon's Souls schließt sich der Kreis mit einem weiteren ausgezeichneten Spielerlebnis, das Dark Souls 2 übertrifft. Es gibt natürlich viele Déjà-vus hinsichtlich des reduzierten Storytellings sowie innerhalb der ebenso verfluchten wie verwunschen anmutenden Welt, die man nach den ersten Toden mit Respekt erkundet. Auch dieses Dark Souls 3 bleibt die sarkastische Grinsekatze, die mal entspannt schnurrt und lockt, bevor sie plötzlich hysterisch faucht und mit einer Tatze tödlich zuschlägt. Die Welt sieht nicht nur fantastisch aus, ihr Aufbau und die Verknüpfungen sowie Abkürzungen erinnern angenehm an das erste Dark Souls - auch wenn es etwas zu viel Komfort gibt, was Teleports, Reparaturen und Leuchtfeuerdistanzen betrifft. Aber hinzu kommen wichtige frische Impulse: Aus künstlerischer Sicht lässt hier und da der apokalyptische Horror eines Bloodborne grüßen, die erzählerischen Leitmotive Asche, Glut und Feuer sorgen aber für genug eigenständigen Charakter. Dieser dritte Teil ist nicht nur größer, abwechslungsreicher und auch lebendiger designt, was Nichtspielercharaktere betrifft. Er markiert hinsichtlich der situativen Spannung auch einen neuen Höhepunkt: Die Verwandlungen der Kreaturen sorgen für mehr Unberechenbarkeit und vor allem die neuen Kampfmanöver erhöhen die Experimentierfreude mit anderen Waffen sowie den taktischen Anspruch, weil sie auch effektiv von der KI eingesetzt werden - derart dramatische Duelle gegen Ritter und Phantome gab es bisher in keinem Souls. Auch wenn die Bildratenprobleme auf den Konsolen sowie die physikalischen Inkonsequenzen nach all den Jahren ärgerlich sind, inszeniert From Software ein hoch spannendes, unheimlich ansehnliches Abenteuer.",9,2018-05-01,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Brownbelt2018,"Dark Souls 3 is an absolute masterpiece. I can not fault a single thing about this game. The combat is fluid and seamless, the world setting is visually brilliant, the array of characters, weapons, and builds available are all some of the things that in my opinion make this game one of the two best releases ever on any platform. The other astounding game is of course Bloodborne. The difficulty can be a bit of a learning curve at first, but once you put quite a few dedicated hours into this game, and realise that the mechanics are different to most other games, it becomes an absolute joy to play. The sense of achievement that comes from success in this game is like no other game I have ever played. I have spent hundreds of hours playing this game, and I still get the same enjoyment from it today as I did the first time I played it.

Malakia,"This third and final entry in the Dark Souls series takes quite some inspiration from its cousin Bloodborne and that may be a very good or bad thing depending on how much you enjoyed the Sony exclusive. For me, it was definitely a plus for I always preferred fast-paced and sleek combat over an over-defensive one, and that's a good thing because DS3's fun combat system is the only thing that makes me want to come back despite the uninspired design of some areas and overall lack of interesting bosses. The main game experience is expanded by two separate DLCs: Ashes of Ariandel and The Ringed City that should've been released as one in the first place considering how small and lackong in content AOA is, that add new weapons and armor pieces that will make PVP enthusiasts happy but do little to really impress the PVE crowd offering a mediocre story conclusion full of plotholes and yet another swampy area nobody asked for.",8,2018-04-21,PLAYSTATION 4,user

ViniciusBrito,"Dark Souls 3 complete and get to the end of the Souls saga story, and i have to say, how it is so similar do the first one, like do almost the exact same thing, but it's incredible how it doesn't feel repetitious at all. This happens because of the hole amount of variety that it give to us, in every aspect. If you enjoyed the first one, you will also with this. I loved how they like to tell the stories/lore here, they don't just thorw in your face for you to watch and listen, you need to go for it and put the pieces together. They did put a bunch of explanations about bosses, group of people and npc's stories in the description of their itens, like in armors or spells that when you gather you have a piece of the lore. They also did this with talking with npc's wich are pretty much all optional, so you really need to go after it if you want to understand. They did added phases and powers for various weapons, very much like bloodborne, they have different abillities that could be with lightining, sorcery and others, you can use those pressing L2 and gonna consume your blue bar, wich was another addiction, that maked sense, then you can't use thoose powers all the time and get to overpower. Another adding was the bosses different phases, when you get their life to the half, most of them does transform or start using different type of powers, that's great, because it gives to the battle more diversity and makes you change your move set. The places are all formidable, the universe building is fantastic, you can see that they did have fondness to do it, are all pretty different, one place to another, the enemies change, the places still all connected and you will always be finding shortcuts, is beautiful how they did it once again. there is one specific place that if you played the others, i swear that you gonna feel a nostalgia in a great way, how they did reconstructed the place but now destroyed, damn, when you see that coming is just fantastic, it's perfect. Another thing that we have in here, is that are a bunch of optional places with bosses to go, places that for you to go, is needed to pay attention in what you have and what the place say to you, kind like the doll in the first one. To not say that i didn't say one bad thing about the movie, they did removed the cut the tail, before you always caught some weapon doing this, in this one, for some reason, the took it off, and personally, i tough that was pretty cool. It was improved the online even more, now we have the possibility to put keys in our games, and then when the friend put the sign on the ground it will automatically show to the other person, and then you will be able to play, this is great. They did put one place that even after you kill the boss of the area you are still able to be invaded and summon people, for pvp, this is another great idea that they did had, because now you don't have to start a new journey, if you don't want to, to play pvp. The gameplay is pretty much just like the first one, not fast as bloodborne, but it works, you can get used to easily. The customization for faces and stuff like that still simple, but inside the world is fantastic, there is a numerous quantity of armours, and here, different than the others, it doesn't make a lot of difference once that you are using something, wich is great, because then when you go online, each person is different, is using some different armour, different than the first one when everybody used that giant stuff, in dark souls 3 you will use the one that is more stylish for you. So basically the game is insanely great, you will have fun, difficulty and will be entretained for a bunch of hours. But if you played the first one and for some reason disliked it, i don't think that you will enjoy this one. But if you did so, no question, just play it.",10,2018-03-29,PLAYSTATION 4,user

filipers,"I have never player a dark souls game before this one, i just saw some videos and heard that it was onde of the hardest games in market. I always loved RPG's/action adventure games, but there was something in dark souls games that didn't attracted me but i didn't know what. But still i tried to give this game a shot, and know what? I have 0 regrets, because it is a great game that we have here. Now in this review i will not compare this game with previous ones, but i will give a genuine review for someone that is new to the series. I must also say that i played the game completely offline since i have no ps plus subscription. I will divide this review based on what i liked and didn't like in this game. So what parts of dark souls 3 i really liked?? -Difficulty: Before starting the game i thought that people exagerated regarding the difficulty in this game, for someone who beated witcher 3 in max difficulty this game will be a piece of cake i **** wrong i was xD. The first 10 hours were sooooo hard for me, the first boss in the tutorial area i think that i died at least 10 times, in the wall of lothric i really suffered at the hand of those bastard knights. I **** again, until the 3rd or 4th boss the game was being really frustrating for me. BUT as soon as i started getting used to the enemies and the game mechanics is started really enjoying this game, i still died a lot of times in boss battles but now instead of getting frustrated i tried to learn the enemies **** the feeling that i had when i finaly won a boss fight is nothing that i ever experienced in another game. If this game was easy i am sure that the score would at least fall to 7. -Combat: skill matters in this game, you can have the best armour and weapons in this game but the trashiest enemies can still **** you up. You can never underestimate an enemy in dark souls 3, and i always fight in maximum against 2/3 enemies at a time. The weapon skills were pretty nice too. And the boss design was outstanding, i had so much fun (and headaches xD) fighting them. -Lore: the lore in this game is hidden in every item that you find in dark souls 3, and how great it is, it was something that i was not expecting in this kind of game. By paying attention of the world that surrounded me i could learn a lot about each location, that was covered in mystery. -Character creation: I know that in most of times your character is hidden behind a helmet, but still the character creator sure impressed me, especially the tattoos! -Leveling system: The idea of becoming stronger has you obtain more souls from your dead enemies is pretty nice. There are also a lot of different attributes regarding your character so you can make a lot of builds! In my playthrough i played as a mercenary, wielding a curved swords and a medium shield, but in my next playthrough i am thinking in playing as a herald, who uses various miracles (a type of magic in this game) and has a nice spear! -Art/Graphics: the representation of a world after the apocalypse is very cool, the churches, the castles, the views, everything is very good looking. The graphics are outstanding too. Now what i did not like so much in this game: Story: Now don't get me wrong, the lore is amazing but i think that there is a really waste of potencial in this game regarding the story. I believe that if the game had more cutscenes, with more interesting characters, i believe that the experience would be better. I would like to see more npc's with different and depth backstories, the ones you find i think that they are very bland. Depressing ending:(SPOILERS) In my ending i linked the first flame, but the flame was already very weak so all my fights during the game were futile, so much sacrifice for in the end the world fall in the age of the dark (which is not necessarily bad, it depends on each person interpretation), you completed your mission that was to link the **** in the end it was all in vain. Now don't get me wrong, there is beauty in this ending, but i would like a more shining ending after all the battles that we had. And basically this ending is a 30 second cutscene which is a bit of a letdown. Overall: A great experience, i have never played a game of this kind, it is very different from normal action-rpg's. Before starting my next playthrough i am viewing youtube videos about the lore in this game, because there were quite some things that i missed and didn't understand in my 1st playthrough. So i am really excited to do again a new journey with a different character/build and this time i will be more alerted to the world that surrounds me in dark sous 3 :). EDIT: I am updating my review to give it a 8.5~9. My second playthrough was even more rewarding, i learned more secrets about this world that escape me the first time. The best thing of this game is that you are never bored while playing it.",9,2018-03-18,PLAYSTATION 4,user

egoBorder,"Dark Souls 3 is a game that ranges from epic and impressive to a bit disappointing. Most of the time the experience is positive. But the Souls formula is starting to show its age, and as the series finale DS3 is stymied by the familiarity of many aspects. Writing as a hardcore fan of the series, I found the flaws were not enough to hold the game back, but they are often right upfront and center. For brevity's sake, I'll list the main factors: the framerate is often deplorable, glitches are occasional and sometimes frustrating. If you've played the other games, you may not like how many things in this game you've seen before. The level design is not the series' peak but sometimes approaches it.

MannWithNoEyes,"In my opinion, Dark Souls III is the ultimate Dark Souls game to play, and is one of my favorite games not just in the Dark Souls series, but in gaming in general. Dark Souls II for me was boring. While it was fun for a short while, the lack of creativity in design and area layout began to frustrate me. The original Dark Souls was very good and important in many ways, however was exceedingly frustrating due to how awkward the combat was. Hallways and arenas were designed so tightly that the walls would constantly interrupt weapon attacks, the camera constantly gets stuck on unimportant objects, and there are many areas which instead of feeling tough yet manageable, have their odds stacked so far against the player that the difficulty stops being an obstacle to overcome, and instead becomes a wall to slowly chip apart. Often the original game feels lackluster due to how often the player will repeat the same area after dying, with no enemy encounter standing out above the rest. Dark Souls III fixes the issue of having an underwhelming combat system by changing the hallway-based design, and complements this with enemies which will absolutely annihilate any careless player. Battling an enemy is now much more dynamic. Enemies have a larger moveset, however there are almost always many weaknesses to exploit and various ways to take down any challenge in the game. While there were certainly many areas which were weaker than others, I was never let down by the cunning way each enemy was designed and placed to make each area a pain in the neck for the player. The bosses are outstanding as always, and with the improved combat are probably my favorite, above Dark Souls I and Dark Souls II. The Abyss Watchers are my favorite due to their gorgeous music and the unique feeling of teamwork present throughout the first phase of the fight. The Dancer of the Boreal Valley is another phenomenal boss due to the slippery way it moves throughout the fight. The Nameless King, while hopelessly frustrating, was intensely satisfying to finally defeat, and stands as an extremely strong optional boss. The optional areas themselves are often not too far out of the way, yet I was consistently impressed by how naturally the game guides the player through the levels, pointing out optional areas and shortcuts along the way by using enemies as a trail of breadcrumbs, moving the player from one to the next sequentially. This type of design leads to a feeling of pride by the player in discovering an optional area or an important item as they feel as though they've earned it by exploring the paths, which have been naturally laid out by the game designers. The optional areas themselves are all worth playing as well, with Archdragon Peak being one of the highlights of the game for me. There are of course frustrations as there are with any outstanding game. There are a few unpolished moments where enemies will get stuck in walls. Certain battles, especially those with two or more enemies feel a bit unfair in how enemies will double-team the player and overwhelm them with attacks which which will guard-break the player, and trap the player in inescapable damage stuns. For someone like me, who is the absolute worst at Dark Souls, these moments were intensely frustrating, and often would result in myself cheating the enemy AI in order to progress, exposing the cracks in an otherwise extremely well-designed game. I dislike how the invisible walls encourage running around blindly smacking every wall in sight in order to access huge optional areas, I dislike how the camera is still a little finicky and can sometimes be an obstacle itself to overcome. However, like all other things in Dark Souls III, adapting to this is possible, though difficult. The highlights in the game far outshine the issues, and as of right now this is the Dark Souls game I will recommend to anyone after Bloodborne. So I'm going to give Dark Souls III a 9 out of 10.",9,2018-02-09,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Every weapons has a 'skill' on top of their default move set with is often very cool. Just exploring a new environment is fun after spending time grinding in another. Every cool enemy has a chance to drop their armor / weapon. The bosses arent insanely difficult and if youre having trouble you can summon an offline npc to help It's still crazy deep.

If you've never played any Dark Souls or Bloodborne and you almost never pick the highest difficulty on your first try no matter what game it is then look away. There are plenty other good games for you. You might be a gamer, veteran with ten, twenty years of experience and this game will just frustrate the hell out of you. I love games and I always seek a challenge. Game for me is not finished unless I did it on the highest difficulty level. Shortly after getting a PS4, my first console, my girlfriend convinced me to buying DS3. She heard it’s a difficult game and she though I might like it. I started with Thief class and the boss during tutorial just wiped the floor with me. After few hours of trying I stopped and took a break for couple of weeks. Then I came back and after many tries managed to beat the boss. In next few days I made probably every possible mistake one can make playing this game. Picking character with weapon that has shortest possible range, check, fat rolling, check, no upgrading weapons, flask, or even souls level, check. Yes, I just went straight to second location without doing anything with NPCs. I had no idea about sneaking. Enemy knights with spear were almost unkillable. When I couldn’t beat second boss with my tiny knife I took another break from the game for few weeks. Before coming back I read some tips and then started again but this time absolutely falling in love with this game. 48 hours and I finished for the first time and another 50h for second play through with both DLCs and I think about playing it again. This game rewards you, your skill and not character level or gear. If you want to be a badass, YOU need to become one, not your character. In most games, even on highest difficulty level once you pass some point, it gets really easy. In Dark Souls, if you’re fighting a dragon that is a size of a building and you’re just a tiny human, it’s going to be hard. If it punches you, your armour doesn’t matter and when you punch it with your toothpick don’t expect to inflict too much pain. Strength in such case is irrelevant, you’re just a tiny fly for them.",10,2017-12-11,PLAYSTATION 4,user

MarsCorialanus,"I'll keep this short, because what more could I say about Dark Souls III. It builds on the past iterations, its fun, its easy to sink hours and hours into this game, and its even good for friendly couch play. If your friends are part of the initiate than this game is heaps of fun to take turns playing. Its easy to watch and fun to play. Those hard boss fights will have your heart pounding like crazy.

addze,"DS3 is my first Dark Souls game and in general my first FROM game. What I like about the game, are the huge variety of different worlds, different enemies, different equipment and different weapons. Though the best about the game is fighting the bosses. Trying out different weapons and helping other players make the game also enjoyable after the first playthrough. Therefore I give the game a solid 8 although it has also a lot of cons in my opinion: in PVP there is always a visual time delay (despite my high speed internet connection), what means hitting the enemy, while he is right in front of you, won't damage him but hitting into the air before he dodges towards will cause damage. Due to this, I don't like the PVP. And that leads to another disadvantage: No matter if you like PVP or not, there is always a chance that someone invades into your world, except you play offline. I think that ****. Further con: It seems like there is a big story behind the game and the bosses in the different areas. Though within the game, the story is not really explained, what makes it especially for a newbies hard to understand. I also don't like the fact, that without following a walkthrough, it is impossible to fulfill all questlines, reach all areas and get all items. In my eyes, there should be a fair chance for the players to reach these things without checking the walkthrough. Also it kind of ****, that with every update, they change statistics, rates, abilities of weapon, armor, spells, etc.. So you can never be sure, that the weapon / spell / armor that you prefer, won't be downgraded tomorrow. My biggest disappointment though, is that the bosses are so cool and still there is no possibility to fight them again (solo) except if you start a new game. Another big con is, that there are physical and magic attacks and you can start with different characters, such as knight, thief, sorcerer, pyromancer, cleric, etc.. Though in PVE, it's much harder to go through the game, if you use magic attacks (i.e. playing as a sorcerer, pyromancer or cleric). The handling is much more complicated, the requirement are high for useful spells and a lot of enemies and bosses are quite resistant against them. Last but not least, I don't like the fact, that many settings just can be done at the firelink shrine (kind of your base camp), as it always takes around 30-45 seconds to load an area.",8,2017-10-05,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Never had more fun ruining other peoples plays or the other way around. The covenant system works well and you can always have a good fair duel. And the community rocks! - Technically the most beautiful Dark Souls (artistically Blood Borne though) - It sticks to what Fans love about Dark Suls and truly delivers (this is rare today) (- Most accessible part of the franchise) Con: - There are some bosses that are quite easy, but at least their presentation is awesome and fearful - There is not much innovation and everything feels a bit too familiar sometimes.

11254man,"I really hate useless _/10 scores, but this platform forces one, so wait until the end for a recommendation on how much you should buy it for, as I feel it to be a more accurate representation of whether the game is, you know... worth it. First, a disclaimer: Even though the DLC for this game is out, this review will be covering Dark Souls 3's base game specifically. Dark Souls 3 is an Action RPG by From Software in the style of Demon Souls, as well as Dark Souls 1 & 2. This game follows behind an underrated classic, what is considered one of the best action RPG games of all time, and Dark Souls 2. So how does it stack up? I personally believe Dark Souls 3 is the best in the series (including Bloodborne). Let's start with the least important stuff about the game, and work up to the stuff that makes Dark Souls Dark Souls. First off, and least importantly: Graphics. The game graphically looks beautiful, far better than even Bloodborne. I stood in awe for 3 or 4 minutes upon first entering Irithyll. The Profaned Capitol, Archdragon Peak, and the previously mentioned Boreal Valley look absolutely stunning. The bosses all have unique looks that compliment the level and world they're in beautifully. Next: The sound. The sound in this game is very good overall, with amazing music for bosses and interesting tracks for the hub world and menus. I wish the enemy's sound design was a bit more varied, but it's quite good other than that (-1 pt.) Next up: The story. This game's story takes the usual Dark Souls approach of mainly being thrown out in Item Descriptions and cryptic dialogue. The items in this game are plentiful, and there are many intricate and well thought out stories and backstories, as Dark Souls usually contains. Your story takes place long past the events of the first two games, a fact reflected through the items and a few amazing late game events that I won't spoil. You have to kill a bunch of crazies who either lit the fire before you, or were supposed to and decided ""Nah"". You're helped out by a bunch of tragic characters along the way, and it retains the grim, oppressive atmosphere that Souls does better than most. Now, most importantly: The Gameplay. The DS3 gameplay is just as tight and fluid as previous installments that aren't Dark Souls 2. Everything is responsive, the bosses are almost all well done, one even likely taking the spot as my favorite all time boss (The Abyss Watchers). And, while the PvE game is the best we may have ever seen, the PvP suffers from a few series-wide issues. First off: lag. Every game has lag, but Dark Souls is too fast to really be able to afford too much of it. This is unfortunately something they didn't iron out in Dark Souls 3, so prepare for a lot of deaths from players teleportation around the map with what feels like an AOL port of Dark Souls 3. This isn't to say that lag is always there, but it's a prevalent issue. Also, like every Dark Souls game, there are some 40 pieces of armor and weapons that From decided to just not put into the game. This wouldn't bother me so much if one of the sets of armor wasn't the Giants Set, effectively ruining my DS3 Giant Dad experience. (-1 pt) So, is the game worth it? Hell yeah it is! The game is 60$, but it's often on sale for less than half that much. Even at full price, however, this game is more than worth it.",9,2017-06-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user
badgerryan19,Being a huge fan of the Souls series I was hyped. And yes it delivered as expected. From Software had more tricks up there sleeve and shows off even more interesting and crazy level design. Still challenging but not impossible.,9,2017-06-19,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Steven105,"At the release of dark souls 3 i gave this game a 10 because i was being a blind fanboy , this is by far the worst game in the franchise it has been terribly dumbed down for casuals , the bosses are too easy the game is too short and what really destroys this game is the god awful pvp ...I cant fathom why fromsoft wanted to encourage every player to be a darksword spamming scrub , and dont even get me started on how broken the hitboxes are , you will be hit from 4 feet away from another player who isnt even within range from you . I went back to dark souls 1 and tested out the hitboxes in pvp and to my surprise the hitboxes were actually accurate i wasnt getting hit by wepons that were out of range , so my question is, why is an outdated ps3 2011 dark souls 1 able to have better pvp hitboxes than a 2016 ps4 dark souls 3? It just baffles me. Also there is an extreme lack of build diversity , all you will see is players using greatswords, straight swords and dark sword and the fact that fromsoft rehashed everything from dark souls 1 just shows there wasnt much thought put into this game they reused patches , siegmeyer , darkmoon covenant ( which still does not work even after they patched it btw) sunbros covenant , dragon covenant , anor londo , almost every weapon and armor from dark souls 1 and 2 . If you want to play this be my guest , no doubt you will enjoy it at first but once you beat the game numerous times and spend alot of time in pvp you will start to realize that this is just an attempt at making a dark souls 1 clone , i am glad this is the last game in the series for now , this should have never been developed .",3,2017-06-19,PLAYSTATION 4,user

TheBlueFox,"My first Dark Souls game, and certainly not my last. Don't be put off by the hype around its difficulty - it's completely doable. It's just challenging. My sibling is a casual gamer and they cut right through this game, simply farming to upgrade their level if they were really struggling. --Surreal, immersive dark fantasy environments --Subtle story-telling technique --Fluid, engaging combat --An array of weapons, spells, shields and armour, each with their own advantages, allowing you to tackle the game any way you want --A great character creator with lots of build options and aesthetic options --Most of the bosses and even minor enemies are well-designed, with mechanics you can study and work around --Difficulty wise, the game is challenging, and that's the fun of it. But most bosses were beatable in 3-5 times, maybe up to 15 times if they were particularly tricky. But there's a great community filled with guides if you're stuck. Plus you can use NPCs or team up with online players (I never actually needed this, but it’s a great option to have if you’re really over that one boss who keeps bludgeoning you) --Rewarding. It’s redolent to how you felt when you overcame fights and bosses as a kid - that feeling of accomplishment when you finally won. --Always new secrets to find - read up on this game. From the lore, to the illusory walls, to the hidden areas and character side quests. It’s got a lot of depth. --Pace is great. I never felt stuck in the same area for too long because I couldn’t progress --Great dialogue and voice acting --Open world with lots to explore --Easy instant travel from Bonfires --Above all, it’s innovative. It’s actually genre-defining. It’s something everyone should try at least once to see if FromSoft games are for you If you’ve never tried a Souls game, this is a great one to start with.",10,2017-06-12,PLAYSTATION 4,user
JuanLuisGG14,"After many hours of gameplay, i think this is a really good game, the gripe ihave is that the saga feels tired, and this game lacks originality (aside from the bosses), too much fanservice and some technical problems Main strong points are graphics style (more varied than Bloodborne), boss design (Twin princes are a highlight), good level design.

SoulsborneLover,"As a veteran of the series, and a huge fan, I feel entitled to an opinion on this game. I played Dark Souls when it first came out, beat it solo at least 5 times as it nearly instantly became one of my favourite games, having excellent map design, level design, creative enemy design, some of the most enjoyable combat to date and, most importantly, AWESOME BOSSES. After Dark Souls it was tough to get into Dark Souls 2, I found the whole experience underwhelming compared to the first but that was to be expected. The largest distinction would be that Dark Souls had CHALLENGE, while 2 had DIFFICULTY. Let me elaborate, challenge is a hurdle, a boss that takes you 15 tries but each time you just get a little bit closer to victory - enough to keep you going. Difficulty, on the other hand, is the unfair enemy design, or unavoidable traps if you dont know theyre there. Due to this difference, I enjoyed Dark Souls a significant amount more. Next came Bloodborne. Oh my god, what a perfect game. The true successor to Dark Souls in my opinion. Fluid combat, level design to make any gamer orgasm, a new weapon system and the best bosses in the series. After Bloodborne my faith in From was renewed entirely and just in time for Dark Souls 3 to go on sale... FINALLY, why Dark Souls 3 only gets a 5. To be honest, compared to Dark Souls and Bloodborne, I would give it a 1 or 2 out of 10 at best (15 hours in, havent had the full experience) but Ive always hated the reviews that butthurt people give when they rank a game 1 out of 10, so, realistically this game is a 5/10. My major issues with this game are the same issues I had with Dark Souls 2, primarily, the bosses. In the 15 hours Ive played, the best designed boss so far has been the tutorial boss... which I would only give a 4/10. I beat every boss 1 try despite being severely under leveled due to dying countless times to the brutally designed mobs, which, in the end just encourages me to run past all the **** enemies to slaughter the game-design-neglected bosses. It just isnt fun at this point. I will mention the pros to this game. New weapon system with weapon abilities, its pretty cool but I havent gotten a lot of use out of it, still a nice addition. The map and level design are... fantastic - without a doubt the highlight of this game, with areas on par to the original Dark Souls in creativity and feel. I honestly cant describe how impressed I am with it, especially when the rest of the game seems so devoid of thought and design. To sum up, it isnt a bad game but it WAS a disappointment beside the others. If you havent played the series, pick it up when its on sale, you might find something you really like. If youre a huge fan of the series, like me, probably still worth the buy with a good sale but be prepared for it to fall short of the bar that From has set.",5,2017-06-03,PLAYSTATION 4,user

reedeeculous,"Dark Souls 3 is a beast and a terrific action-adventure game. It has hands down the best roster of bosses out of all the games, the combat is as good as it ever was, and the game looks fantastic. A handful of gripes prevent me from giving this a full on 10, however. The world is unfortunately more linear in its construction, closer to DS2 than the original, which I feel is an unfortunate misstep. Additionally, the obvious attempt to retcon material from DS1 and 2 in a doomed attempt to make a logical story out of all this material - none of which EVER made any clear sense! - was unnecessary. So I can't give it a full 10. It is a strong, proud 9, but can't overcome the ineffable charm of the original.",9,2017-05-17,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Sektor115,"The Trilogy of Souls What would be the best way to wrap up a game series notorious for its difficulty? It’s simple, by making the final installment even harder and more relentless. Welcome to the world of Dark souls 3. Staying true to its original roots, Dark Souls 3 takes the notorious difficulty to a whole new level. The twisted collection of horrifying enemies armed with an arsenal of endless death coupled with bigger and deadlier bosses make the challenge all too real; and the sense of impending doom originating back to the original Dark Souls is alive and well. Aside from the difficulty and the constant adversity, Dark Souls 3 also carries a hint of serenity. The artwork and graphical quality of this insane and dangerous world is at the top of its game. The kingdom of Lothric was truly brought to life through vivid imagery. The glistening sun and shimmering water; all the way down to the very trees, which seem to whisper omens of death as you pass them by. Curiosity and determination drive you forward as you explore castles, caves, catacombs and many other locations, all filled with treasure to collect; and any number of nightmarish creatures waiting to kill you. I would have to give Dark Souls a 9/10 for being an incredible game on its own, but also a perfect send-off for the Dark Souls trilogy.",9,2017-04-04,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Skezzer,"Out of all of the games that I have played, Dark Souls III has proven to be the only one to offer bosses that I find near impossible to defeat yet also do so without creating a sense of frustration. These bosses are never unbeatable, never unfairly balanced. They simply require a greater level of skill, concentration and memorization than those in other games. The same can said about the enemies, as the easy enemies that can be killed in one shot that seem to be ever present in other games are hereby lacking. Instead, all of the enemies in Dark Souls offer a unique experience that the player needs to adapt to as quickly as possible in order to advance. Additionally, the game innovates on features from other games in a very unique way, albeit in a very similar way to the innovation found in the original Dark Souls. Instead of the random health regeneration found in other games, the player is placed with the responsibility of choosing the best time to use up the valuable estus flasks (this game's version of a health pack) that are in quite limited supply that increases as you advance in the game in order to stop it from becoming unfair. This, combined with the unbelievable variety of weapons, outfits and rings, allows for a combat experience that can't be found anywhere else. This is further enhanced by the great enemy AI but I will admit that the AI can sometimes prove to be rather idiotic, even if only in limited circumstances. The game's graphics are fantastic, simply a gem to look at, and the audio matches the game tone in a perfect way. The story is far from straight forward and will probably require you to read through pages of item descriptions and character dialogue in order to understand all of its complexities but the basic plot is quite easy to follow if you aren't too interested in the backstory. Some of the game's only problems are found in its sometimes complex level design. i have to say that it took me quite some time to figure out where to go in the swamp level. Also, some of the game's side-bosses can be quite hard to find without a walkthrough but I found that these problems rarely subtracted from the game's overall quality. In conclusion, after beating the game twice after 80 hours ( last year) I would strongly recommend this game to anyone looking for the game that is a bit more of a challenge with fluid combat. Thanks for reading. :)",10,2017-04-04,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Obby360,"Having played the first two games and their respective DLC's, I come here with some scepticism as to how this story would fit in. The standard's were very high, expectations to the roof. Where the first, I personally felt, lacked a bit in combat, this game give it to the fullest. Where the second lacked in meaningful NPC's and stories, this one has a plenty. From the most common merchant, to the secret boss, everything is thought out and planned in classical Dark Souls fashion. The gameplay is familiar enough to scare you exploring, but inviting just a bit, to make you want to test different play styles. It's an adventure that packs 60 hours of gameplay in your first try, maybe even more if you dare go far off the beaten path. And speaking of such a path, maybe it's only downfall is the linear story towards the end. For Souls fans who always sough the mystery of where to go next (I myself have spent hours on youtube figuring that out) It is a bit of a disappointment. The bosses in this game are the most diverse in the entire Souls franchise. Big, scary, fast, unforgiving, there is a favourite boss for everybody. I might go as far as to say that there is one boss that gives Artorias, and OnS a run for their gold coin. In the end, Dark Souls III answers many lore questions, but raises quite a few knew ones. A beautifully incandescent addition to the Souls franchise, and a great stand alone game.

chrisse989,"Positives: - game looks great Negatives: - Too much reused assets from previous games, major parts of the game feels so déjà vu (although partially intentional by the developers). In general a lack of originality. Going through another lookalike version of Valley of Defilement or catacombs gets old. - Story is too obscure. If there's no or very few info available in the game, you don't bother anymore why you are fighting the next boss or what they're doing there in the first place - Exploration needs to be more rewarding. 90% of the items you'll find you'll never use, so why bother in the end? - NPCs are too hard to find. The game seems to expect you recheck every nook and cranny of each past area each time you've beaten a boss to find them. - Lack **** music score (also a problem with the previous two DAS games).

HTGamer,"Dark Souls III is a great game, but it's also a disappointing Dark Souls game. If you have played a Souls game before, you know what to expect here. It's an open world dungeon crawler filled with traps and powerful enemies, with brutal difficulty but fair and rewarding gameplay. The online system of co-op and invasions is back, along with the covenants. There is also an arena PvP mode introduced in the Ashes of Ariandel DLC, but it's lame. The story is vague, as per the series' tradition, which is something that I don't really like. There is a whole fantasy universe and plot that gets buried in the descriptions of items, and chances are most players won't understand a thing because the lore needs to be read in fan-made wikis. Most players will just accept they have to slay anything that moves and progress to the end of the campaign and beat the final boss. Gameplay is solid as ever but it hasn't progressed much since Dark Souls 1, or even Demon's Souls. It's stuck in the same old pattern, while Bloodborne refreshed the series' gameplay in a huge way. There is only the addition of Weapon Stances, weapon-specific special moves (maybe inspired by Bloodborne's transforming weapons), but since they consume magic points to execute, players can't really use them as often as desired and will have to rely on the usual normal and heavy attacks. Another disappointment is the lack of art imagination. Most areas are copied from previous games. You have a new Castle, new Undead Settlement, new Library, new Catacombs, another poisonous lake, even a portion of Dark Souls 1's Anor Londo castle makes a return. There are a few completely new and original areas such as Irithyll of the Boreal Valley, but it's too little. Enemy mobs are great and varied, maybe a 100 different designs. Some of them even transform and buff themselves so they become really dangerous. The fight against The Dancer of Boreal Valley is a phenomenal boss fight, and 2 or 3 others are challenging and/or interesting, but the rest of them are just lame. Going into technicalities, graphics have been upgraded since Dark Souls 1 and 2, but not by much. Just like Bloodborne, frame rate on PS4 suffers not only from small drops here and there but also from bad frame pacing, so you get a constant jerkiness in motion even when the average is 30 fps. Thankfully the game remains highly playable. The soundtrack is meh, whereas Bloodborne's was majestic. Dark Souls III is a great game, but it failed to progress an already exceptional series. Releasing just a year after the magnificent Bloodborne, I think DS3 was rushed out the door. And since the game feels uninspired I suspect FROM Software kept the best elements for the Season Pass, just like with DS2. Guess what, they did exactly that. Both DLCs Ashes of Ariandel and The Ringed City look far more interesting than anything in the main DS3 game, even though they are overpriced for what they offer in terms of content and hours of play. My 7/10 score reflects the main game's state. I 'd score it a 7.5/10 if I could, but since it doesn't deserve an 8/10 it's a 7/10 then. A future GOTY Edition will be an 8.5/10 with the DLCs included.",7,2017-03-27,PLAYSTATION 4,user

SassyQuatch,"If Metacritic could represent decimals in their scoring system, my review would show as an 8.5/10. This game really does a lot of things right, and it is probably fair to say that it is the penultimate Dark Souls experience. Dark Souls 3 succeeds in providing players with the challenging gameplay that Dark Souls fans have come to love. The world of Dark Souls 3 is by far the most immersive and visually impressive world that has come out of the developers of the Souls/Bloodborne games. The cliché praise of graphics (matched only by the cliché claim that graphics don't matter) in this case truly alters the gaming experience. With the winning combination of perfected world design and demanding gameplay, you will not be in want of escapism with this game. That being said, there are several things holding this game back from a 10/10, or even a 9/10. Among these drawbacks includes the somewhat underwhelming bosses. Some bosses in this game are really underperforming. Another criticism: with all the new mechanics available to the developers, it would have been nice to see them try something new. To be sure, the Dark Souls series operates on a very successful and gratifying-to-play formula. But it is, undoubtedly, the same formula put on display in all three Dark Souls games. This can bring with it an additional annoyance, considering especially the sometimes cheap deaths that seem to be more of an easy-way-out-design than a genuine challenge. Nonetheless, at the end of the day this game is definitely one of the more worthwhile experiences that can be found on the new console.",8,2017-03-21,PLAYSTATION 4,user

NinjaDave,"Dark Souls 1 would be my favorite out of the 3 but unfortunately because of the horrible frame rate and other minor issues, I cannot give it that spot as my favorite. Dark Souls 3 however is so polished and improved from the 1st game in Music, Graphics, Bosses, Combat and level design that this really is a no brainer why this game is considered one of the best RPGs of all time. This is one of the reasons why other RPGs need to step up their game to get onto From Software's level in terms of combat. I didn't think anything could even get on par with Bloodborne's combat but Dark Souls 3 does and still to this day there is not a game that has surpassed these 2 games. The music for me is what has improved from the past games and it shows with the boss music. The Abyss Watchers and Final boss music are up there with my best in the series. The way the music transitions to the original boss music is the best and is a great way to look back at how far From Software has come and how far you have improved since the first. Once again, there are so many moments and experiences you will only get from playing a Dark Souls game and that's what makes the game so great. Watching videos or playing for a few hours won't be enough, you have to play and experience the whole game for yourself. This is easily one of my favorite games of all time and I don't see many games topping this from years to come. A must play for fans of the RPG Genre.",10,2017-03-18,PLAYSTATION 4,user

pongkrit03,"Darksouls 3 is a good game and would have been 10/10 if it was released 6 years ago. However, releasing in 2016 with this low quality graphic is a huge let down. Dark Souls 3, while having new bosses, new maps, new enemies, does not improve much from Dark Souls 2. It is better to say it is Dark Souls 2 expansion rather than Dark Souls 3. The game is fun, of course, like every soul series you could expect, but that is it. There is not much innovative here. Bloodborne, on the other hand, is better than DarkSouls 3 in every aspect even though it came out earlier, except for multiplayer that DS3 is better but still in the same league as DS2. The difficulty is ok. Most bosses are easy but some are very tough (Nameless king). Soundtrack is clearly inferior to Bloodbonre. The length of the game is great.. NPC side quests are too complicated though. You will not be able to complete most of them without looking on guide in internet. Some maps feel like a maze, which I don't like it. Heavy armors are nerfed a lot in DS3 to the point you don't need to use them. There are a ton of weapons but most of them have same movesets, a bit tweak here and there. The new system, Asen Estus and weapon skill, is introduced here. It is good system though but it does not influence gameplay enough to feel fresh. In sum, My solid score for DarkSouls 3 is 7/10. It is a good game but has a little improvement over DS2. I hope Fromsoft will overcome this obstacle and make greater game in the future.",7,2017-03-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user

BlakDak666,"Dark Souls 3 is very well done game that is a fitting end to the Souls series. It suffers from an identity crisis (as a result of borrowing too much from its own games to add something really new to the formula) but it has some of the best soundtrack scores in gaming history and some of the best bosses made in the series. The atmosphere is always top notch, the challenge is still ever present and it is a treat for long time fans and yet still strong enough to be good for newcomers as well. It still has issues as well: PVP is downplayed, game feels much shorter, graphical/technical issues at launch, fair share of bad bosses and enemy concepts still and trying a bit too much to grasp the power that Bloodborne achieved. Overall, a very good game that deserves a chance to be played and a worthy final ""hurrah"" emote of the Soul series.",8,2017-03-09,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Ishi123,"Yay, Dark Souls 3! I guess? Egh... I can't help but feel a bit of Dark Souls fatigue here, despite nabbing the game first day and playing the living hell out of the thing, top to bottom just like 1, 2 and Bloodborne. However, the game still isn't quite up to par with Dark Souls or Bloodborne. That may not be fair, considering a whole bunch of things aren't up to par with them, but hear me out. Combat is more Dark Souls 1 than 2 was, and it feels nice and deliberate and satisfying like the first game. However, the one thing that sets it way behind 1 and even 2 for me is that they both favored Bloodborne's ideal of being faster rather than stronger, which is what I play Bloodborne for, From, and the fact that poise is no longer a thing. And I'm talking to you, ""poise is working as intended"" people. This ain't my poise. Getting stunlocked by rats while wearing full Havel gear isn't poise, it's stupid and frustrating. But of course, enemies all have normal poise because that's how good game design is done. Though, I favor the longsword and shield build, so I wasn't as affected as I could've been. But still... rats. Then there's the fact that Dark Souls 3 is point-for-point just Dark Souls. Same areas, same story, and even some bosses are pretty much the same. Dark Souls 2 deviated further from 1 than 3 has. Going through the game, I pretty much always went ""oh, look, it's that one item from Dark Souls 1"", or ""oh, look, it's that one enemy from Dark Souls 1"", and, ""oh, look, it's that one character from Dark Souls 1"", then ""oh, look, it's like this one place from Dark Souls 1"", and then I get to a place that actually straight up IS from Dark Souls! You're lucky it's the best area in that game and it makes sense in story context, or I would've bashed that bit more. This review isn't as extensive as my other Souls game reviews because there really isn't much else I can say about it. It's ""another Dark Souls"", and that's about it. It's still fun, it's still challenging, it's still huge with creative bosses and satisfying combat, but From has done everything they can do at this point. However, I will say that the final boss for this game is probably my favorite, or at least tied for my favorite boss in the entire series for being so amazingly thematic and a well-designed fight. This game is rated higher than I would've put it for one major reason: it's the last. And it certainly feels that way. The game really does feel like the final one, and I think From worked to make it feel that way. The final boss is truly an amazing sendoff to an amazing series. If you want more Dark Souls, then 3 is certainly worth your time.",8,2017-02-18,PLAYSTATION 4,user
cofeoefoe,"Pros: Amazing graphics, Immersive experience, Beautifully crafted weapons and armor. Great integrated pvp and pve system, Bosses that won’t let you give up until you slaughter them. Cons: Will be VERY difficult for beginners new to the Dark Souls franchise, endgame is PVP, a few bugs and glitches every here and there. Dark souls 3 is hands down FromSofts best creation in the souls series stretching all the way from 2009’s Demon Souls. So first things first this game is $60 and I think this is a fair price because of all the content that comes with the game and that will be coming for the DLC (Downloadable Content) . As soon as you step into the world of this game you’ll be able to make a character of your choosing such as attributes,what class,starting items, and what you look like. After that the tale begins of the Ashen One's journey to link the flame. You start off very simply until you journey to the next area where all the detail and hard work from the last 2 years has shone into this game. You can see the sun shining through the broken rocks and reflecting off the water. After over 1000 hours of playing this game I still can’t get enough of how beautiful each and every area of this game is. And if people find this game is too difficult they can always play with their friends which has been a traditional feature in all the soul games, or if their feeling evil they can go invade someone else’s world and show them what dark souls really means. If you're still not interested I have a lot left to convince you why this game is worth your time. The tutorial of this game in not easy and it’s not meant to be either, the game wants you to keep dying to the boss and the mobs to prepare you for what lies ahead in the world. Unfortunately this makes a lot of players quit the game and make them feel like they’ve been scammed only after they’ve been a few times. This game has so much value that people don’t discover because they just give up. When you do get past the first boss you start to tie into the main plot of the game and why you were chosen to link the first flame. Lotric which is the main city in the game has dungeons and enemies everywhere to make it a challenge. For the game, mechanics are very simple the game has messages lying around telling you what every button does. Now the cherry on the top of the game revolves around the bosses I’m not gonna spoil anything because I want people to experience it for themselves. The game also runs very well at a constant 60 frames per second everywhere you go. I don’t have much else to say about this game without spoiling it. If you do decide to get this game you should keep going until the very end and try not to summon other players unless it get’s very difficult. Overall if you do keep keep this game in get discouraged because you keep failing you’ll never get the true value of this game which is the shining star.",10,2017-02-13,PLAYSTATION 4,user
willl2021,"Dark Souls 3 Developed by From Software is at times the most difficult rage inducing game ever but at other times it is one of the most exciting and engaging video games in recent memory. Trust me, the game’s tagline isn’t “Prepare to Die” for nothing. It is a game where no one has a happy ending especially your character (most likely). From Software has done it again. This game is a great way to end off the Souls trilogy while being maybe the best game in the series. A minor warning: this game is very sad and depressing. Dark Souls 3 takes place in the kingdom of Lothric at the end of an era but it’s not just that, it’s also the end of the age of fire, pretty much the end of the world. In Dark Souls 3 you play as the “Ashen One”. Your only purpose in life is to prolong the age of fire by killing the four Lords of Cinder. They are Aldrich the Saint, The Abyss Watchers, Yhorm the Giant, and Lothric the prince who is named after the kingdom. All of this is explained in the opening cinematic. Your character wakes up in a graveyard and you start the game. This isn’t a game that has a huge story. A lot of the lore you find in item descriptions and are up to your own interpretation. Dark Souls is probably most famous for its bosses and as usual From Software has made another great batch of bosses which are all accompanied with their own score of music composed by a whole choir. Also, don’t worry about difficulty. This game is extremely tough! And due to their extreme difficulty after defeating them, every boss gives you an overwhelming feeling of accomplishment. The gameplay is fluid and easy to learn but hard to master. An important new addition is how fast-paced the combat is compared to the other games. This game is also very pretty. It has great graphics and runs great with minor frame rate issues. There are a lot of gigantic set pieces that made my jaw drop when I saw them. Although I have to say some of the bosses do border on unfair. This game might be perfect in my eyes but I can definitely see why some others might think it terrible. The game is hard and unforgiving and it’s way too dark and difficult for younger kids so don’t get this for a 10 year old on his birthday because he might break a controller or two. But if you have the patience and like a good challenge and weaving your own interpretation of a story then this game is definitely for you. I think this game is near perfect but mainly because of the frame rate issues and the slightly unfair bosses it is held back from being a masterpiece.

Having said that I loved Dark Souls 3 personally! Yes its hard, yes its frustrating and yes its sometimes a little annoying too but jeez is it addictive! FromSoftware rewards players that take their time to study the environment and enemies and come up with a strategy. Learning from WHY you died is the most important thing here. If you want a super engaging cool story-line play GTA. If you want near perfect graphics play Uncharted. If you want an awesome combat RPG that's ridiculously hard but makes you keep coming back for more until you kill that ****, then play Dark Souls 3.

You can R1 spam all the way through this game with a straight sword and resins. And then do it again in NG+ and NG++. Of course, you may want to roll your way to victory too, since it costs no stamina to do so. There is no thought or deliberation required in any kind of fighting in this game. It's basically mindless spamming all the way. And then of course, there's the PvP. Invasions are a total nonsense now, duelling gets very old very fast. Two of the covenants still don't work properly. I'll admit to having good fun as an Aldrich and a Watchdog though. The last DLC was easily the worst DLC From have made in these games. Way too short, uninspiring and basically nothing new. Shouldn't be surprised that a niche game that becomes popular is suddenly dumbed down to appeal to the masses, but for a game that made its name by being difficult, this is even more hard to swallow.

Indeed it feels as though the game is lacking the Dark Souls charm; covenants are uninspired (except for Mound-Makers, arguably the most innovative part of DS3) and the game is the most linear Dark Souls yet. The 1st DLC was fun albeit short, and some mechanics like rolling are ridiculously broken to the point you can simply strip to your trousers and roll past everything.

Dream_For_Game,"Dark Souls III: An Examination of a Challenging and Evolved MasterpieceDark Souls III is a title that immediately conjures an image of a breathtaking challenge and an evolved experience compared to its predecessors. In a succinct description, it can be deemed “extremely difficult.” While the first two installments of this series also received similar reviews upon their release, this particular iteration has proven increasingly difficult and challenging, deterring many from continuing the journey, unaware that they are being deprived of experiencing a high art **** mechanics and gameplay of this title are significantly in line with the previous two entries; the player steps into the cold and soulless world of Dark Souls with a slew of unanswered questions and uncertainties regarding their motivation for battle. As mentioned earlier, the gameplay has overall integrity, but is accompanied by more finesse and fluidity, completely eliminating the dry and disjointed feel of Dark Souls II’s gameplay. In fact, from a gameplay perspective, Dark Souls III demonstrates remarkable and significant progress. However, other aspects remain largely the same, and the player is required to upgrade their weapons throughout the game. Also, if using a “magic build,” searching and discovering various spells becomes essential. The overall structure of the game, despite the vastness of the environments, follows a linear path, avoiding providing the player with unbridled freedom of action.From a visual standpoint, the game’s graphics have improved compared to the previous version. However, what has always been of great importance in the Dark Souls series is the atmospheric and innovative design of the game’s environments, which encourages the audience, despite the excruciating difficulty of the game, to persevere and advance. In addition to the eye-catching environments, the side characters and side quests are designed with such quality that they encourage the player to experience the game repeatedly in order to fully understand the events; a point that was also evident in NieR: Automata.Meanwhile, Boss Fights have always been known as one of the most memorable and prominent pillars of the Dark Souls series. This version not only preserves this authenticity but also provides battles with far superior and more challenging designs compared to the previous two entries. Although the design of the game’s environments and boss fights appears impressive overall, some environments lack sufficient appeal, and some bosses ultimately appear so weak that they can be considered ordinary enemies.Nevertheless, Dark Souls III confronts the audience at every moment with its novel challenges and unique surprises. Each environment, in addition to its specific boss, benefits from unique traps and special enemies. In this game, there are numerous ways to complete: using hand-to-hand combat, using magic, or a combination of both. Ultimately, the game’s ultimate goal will be to ignite the First Flame, extinguish it, or enter an age of darkness.Regarding storytelling, Dark Souls III refrains from providing a straightforward narrative. With the exception of the game’s initial cutscene, the storyline continues to be presented solely through the texts in the items. This allows the audience to determine the amount of clarity or ambiguity of the story. Although many players, due to the difficulty of the game, the challenging battles and the attractive boss fights, do not pay much attention to the story, Dark Souls III has a rich and complex story that can be confidently considered the richest and most complex story in the history of video games. In order to understand this story, a careful examination of all the items and a study of the narratives related to them is essential. Interacting with the game’s characters can also help to better understand the story.Ultimately, Dark Souls III offers an experience that transcends the ability of any other game.",10,2025-02-12,PLAYSTATION 4,user

ultrasoft,"Smooth and fun to play, they really refined the mechanics of play nicely. It's the best feeling in the hands that Dark Souls ever gets. There is a multitude of fun stuff to collect and play with, and tons of character builds to make. I had a lot of fun as a sneaky sorcerer, a twin blade wielding sellsword, and a healing cleric, and many others. The bosses are some of the funnest (and toughest) in the series. My favourites being the epic Slave Knight Gael fight, the Twin Demons and the Lothric and Lorian fight, which I feel comes closest to a DS1 boss in terms of tonality. Unfortunately, the game is far more linear than DS1, which weakens replay value. The lore, story, characters and writing failed to provoke the same gutpunching emotional connectivity of DS1 for me. There is a similar lack of genre (and game convention) bending innovation, mysterious weirdness, and just plain oddball stuff that made me fall in love with DS1. It's a bit too smoothed over in many regards, which I am sure is a pro to newcomers to the series and more casual gamers. It suffers from being a sequel and being the most formulaic iteration of Dark Souls so far. DS2 took more risks, which I respect, even though I am not a great fan of DS2 overall. There are fewer truly low points than DS1 (there is no truly obvious nadirs like Izalith) which is a positive, but there are fewer highs. It is a fun game (I played many hours, mostly co-opping bosses) but it just cannot stand up to DS1 or Bloodborne, and in that regard I couldn't help but feel some dissapoinment. There is a lot to like, but ds3 fails to be a brilliant game transcending experience I felt I got from DS1, which is, to be fair, an extremely lofty standard to live up to.",7,2025-02-01,PLAYSTATION 4,user

After two playthroughs the cracks start to show and the general clunkiness starts to get annoying. Why am i constantly getting knocked down by normal enemies? Why am i constantly getting interrupted when attacking? I swear in my 70h of playing my attacks got interrupted at least 10 thousand times. It really starts to just feel bad to play. Also non-boss enemy design is too fast with too many combos that do too much damage. You can easily get completely stun locked to death by just two-three enemies.

AdoMobA,"Pros - crisp combat that feels fair - the best boss design in Dark Souls - the Ringed City DLC only serves to elevate the game - massive amounts of build variety // Cons - way less interconnected map design - the only good thing about Ashes of Ariandel is the final boss fight // Being the third game, following what many people consider a disappointing entry and ending the Dark Souls series, DSIII had to stick the landing. We are all lucky it didn't just stick it. DSIII landed on its feet and decided to do cartwheels. Best boss design among the three entries. Massive weapon, armor and ring variety that allows for an unimaginable amount of builds. Combat that doesn't feel like two trucks trying to flip each other over. It does everything right. As to the previously mentioned boss design, it is goated. Nameless King and the Slave Knight are my two favorite fights amongst everything Fromsoft has ever released. Dancer, Pontiff, Abyss Watchers are iconic. The only bosses I would label as bad are Aldritch, Wolnir and Scat Tree. DSIII also does something that is not just rare for a Fromsoft game, it is very rare in media in general. It provided one of the most cinematic and mechanically engaging fights as the very final thing you engage in. And where Gale runs, Nameless walks. Both of them are so mechanically perfect, that dying to them truly feels like a mistake on my part instead of a wrong hitbox. Ingenious. Dark Souls III is the rare media conclusion, where everybody left satisfied at the end. If you have doubts about jumping in, just take the leap and experience one of the best products, from one of gaming's biggest darlings.",10,2024-06-25,PLAYSTATION 4,user

tensioly,"Dark Souls III es el Dark Souls definitivo y el perfeccionamiento de una fórmula que durante años se ha ido puliendo para ser a día de hoy de las sagas más influyentes en la industria. Con unas 32 horas de juego habiendo completado gran parte del contenido opcional, este Soulslike ha conseguido encandilarme gracias a una jugabilidad muy completa y versátil, con multitud de formas de jugar, lo que otorga gran rejugabilidad. Los combates desafiantes frente a enemigos y jefes son en su mayoría magistrales y varios de ellos llegan a un nivel de epicidad y puesta en escena que consiguen colocarse en algunos de mis combates favoritos que he jugado nunca. A la impresionante jugabilidad se añade un gran diseño de diseño de mundo y un apartado artístico excelente que te transporta al Reino medieval de Lothric. A nivel gráfico es cumplidor y de rendimiento en PS5 funciona fluido a 60 fps. El apartado gráfico viene acompañado de una gran calidad a nivel de sonido y con una banda sonora con temas épicos para el recuerdo, probablemente siendo la mejor de la saga junto a Bloodborne. El DLC del Mundo Pintado de Ariandel me parece algo mejorable pero el de La Ciudad Anillada posee los que son fácilmente los mejores combates del juego y llega a un nivel de maestría excepcional. Como punto negativo puedo destacar la historia, que aunque estemos acostumbrados a que sea sutil, tanto en esta como en el lore del mundo me ha costado seguir su hilo más que en otros juegos de la saga. Dark Souls III es una obra maestra y un juego muy recomendado para todos los jugadores que deseen una experiencia desafiante y gratificante. 9,6/10 (06/2024)",10,2024-06-12,PLAYSTATION 4,user

nh59bany,"Dark Souls III is one of the rare games that feels like a constant icy shower on first playthrough with moments of constriction and discomfort, that erupt in joy and relief and a pride of success that I perceive as unparalleled in my long history of playing video games.I do not know how it feels if this is your first kind of game that is as uncompromising and unyielding as the Souls games than Dark Souls. It was my third after playing half through Bloodborne and being completely absorbed by Dark Souls I. If you found any joy in its gameplay style, in its gatekeeping and abstract story telling, in its shady and dubious worldbuilding, you will find in Dark Souls III a piece of art that is at the peak of presentation of atmosphere, boss fights, story-depth and the tragic twisted philosophical themes that stuck with me ever since. Read no further, start it and let it tumble over you - The only things keeping it from being a 10/10 is the occasional involuntarily over-powering on subsequent playthroughs, the equipment load juggling I simply do not like as an skilling moderator in the Souls games and the swamp level at Farron Keep that I perceive as bloated and redundant in its size.",9,2024-02-15,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Building upon the foundation of the series, it introduces fluid and responsive gameplay that rewards skillful timing and strategic decision-making. Each encounter is a thrilling dance of life and death, demanding both patience and quick thinking. From tense sword fights to intense spellcasting, the combat is a true masterpiece that keeps players engaged and on the edge of their **** world design in Dark Souls 3 is an absolute marvel.

The interconnectedness of the world delights players, offering shortcuts and hidden paths that make exploration a true joy. Unraveling the secrets hidden within Lothric is an adventure in itself, providing a sense of discovery and wonder.Graphically, Dark Souls 3 sets a new standard for the series. From grandiose vistas to the tiniest details, the game showcases stunning visual fidelity. The lighting effects, intricate textures, and attention to detail all contribute to an immersive and atmospheric experience. Dark Souls 3's gloomy yet beautiful art direction flawlessly captures a sense of impending doom and the decaying grandeur of the **** storytelling in Dark Souls 3 delivers a poignant tale that ties together the loose threads from its predecessors. The intricate lore is interwoven into the world, leaving breadcrumbs for players to discover and interpret. From enigmatic NPCs to cryptic item descriptions, the narrative unfolds gradually, offering moments of revelation and emotional weight. The somber yet captivating storytelling enriches the experience, leaving a lasting impression on the player.Multiplayer functionality in Dark Souls 3 continues to be a highlight. The seamless integration of cooperative play adds an element of shared triumph and camaraderie, while the unpredictable invasions keep players on their toes. Whether earnestly assisting others or engaging in intense PvP battles, the multiplayer component adds depth, replayability, and a sense of community to the game.While Dark Souls 3 excels on almost every front, a few minor blemishes prevent it from achieving a perfect score. Occasional technical issues and minor balancing inconsistencies detract slightly from the overall experience. However, these do not significantly impact the game's brilliance and are negligible in the face of its many achievements.",9,2024-01-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user
cavaleto,"Estou jogando Dark Souls a um tempo e posso dizer com certeza que esse é um dos meus jogos favoritos, antes de comprá-lo eu acreditava que não conseguiria jogar o jogo por conta de sua dificuldade sempre via as pessoas falarem ""Nossa Dark souls é o jogo mais difícil que já joguei"" ""Ele é quase impossível"" e conheci pessoas que desistiram do jogo por conta de sua dificuldade com isso tive a impressão que o jogo se resumia apenas a isso um jogo difícil, mas agora percebo que NÃO Dark Souls não é um jogo impossível e qualquer um pode jogá-lo e com toda certeza ele não se resumi no fato de ser **** começo admito que fiquei com a mesma impressão dos comentários que ouvia sobre a obra que ele era apenas um jogo difícil e que não conseguiria jogá-lo por conta disso desisti dele por um tempo e até mesmo me recordo de ter escrito um texto enorme em um serv do discord do porquê eu não gostar desse jogo, porém em um dia onde estava sem nada para jogar me deparei com o vídeo do youtuber gemaplys de uma hora sobre Dark Souls III e com resolvi dar mais uma chance a ele.Após passar do primeiro boss fui me interessando cada vez mais pelo jogo e com isso comecei a pesquisar sobre ele no YouTube e na internet e vi o quão vasto e cheio de conteúdo era esse jogo, a cada boss a cada arma conquistada ia me interessando mais e mais (é meio irônico falar a cada arma conquista, pois estou com a claymore desde lothric kkkk) fui pegando mais dicas indo para caminhos alternativos do mapa e vendo o quão esse jogo era genial e que ele não se resumia a um jogo difícil.Umas das coisas que eu mais amo no Dark Souls sem sombra de dúvidas são suas quests, pois além da história principal do jogo ser complexa e sensacional as secundarias também mostram jornadas e propósitos diferentes de cada personagem do jogo como, por exemplo, Siegward mais conhecido como ""cebolão"" cujo pretende....jogue para descobrir ;).Outra coisa que amo não só em Dark Souls como na série souls em geral é a mecânica de boss opcionais, é sensacional o fato dos desenvolvedores e desing terem elaborado chefes apenas por opção onde neles você pode tanto subir seu número de almas e sua experiência como também desfrutar de combates incríveis como a qual estou no momento contra a armadura do matador de dragões (bastante difícil **** muito mais coisa que gostaria de falar sobre Dark Souls aqui um dia pretendo fazer um vídeo no meu canal sobre esse jogo que sem sombra de dúvidas mudou a maneira na qual eu via os jogos Miyazaki é um verdadeiro artista um gênio mereceu o goty de 2022 e 2016 (PORQUE TODOS SABEMOS QUE DARK SOULS GANHOU O GOTY EM 2016 >:( se você tiver com dinheiro sobrando eu recomendo muito comprar essa obra-prima é sério não acredite nos comentários que as pessoas dizem sobre essa arte ""que ele é muito difícil e blá blá blá"" esse jogo é incrível e valeu cada centavo gasto ele o que gta e Minecraft foi importante para minha infância essa obra esta sendo para minha adolescência e agora Elden Ring que me aguarde >:).",10,2024-01-18,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Netherghul,Worst of the 3 but that's not saying much its still amazing. Loses a lot of the Dark souls charm and feels smashed together with Bloodborne. PvP is still okay but it not on Dark Souls 2s level. The desync and hitboxes are unbearable and the ganking is even more pathetic than DS1. However the world is beautiful and the map is designed well. This game also has some of the most fun bosses in the series.

El mapa y los jefes están increíblemente diseñados y nunca he visto un juego tan bien diseñado como este, el mapa es muy extenso pero equilibrado a su vez y los jefes ni hablar simplemente es brillante cada batalla parece la ultima por la ""epicidad"" que tiene, pero hablando de la batalla final en si, aunque su dificultad no sea mucha como otros jefes es simplemente una de las peleas mas épicas de la historia de los videojuegos, la música, el rival, y por sobre todo un escenario increíble hace que sea una experiencia inolvidable.

Shockscape,"I will start with the positives. Overall all the bosses look cool. The combat is very similar to Elden Ring, so therefore great. And some of the bosses are just great, I mean the last bosses of both the base game and the DLC’s are exceptional. Also the story is quite interesting, but I can’t say I understood it from just the game. I had to watch a YouTube video to understand it. And you can’t forget some of the tracks in the soundtrack. They’re amazing. Now for the negatives. It’s just too tough in certain areas. I had to get lots of help in the form of online co-op just to get past some of the bosses, so it kinda ruined my enjoyment of the ones I got help for. Luckily I beat the final bosses for the base game and both the DLC’s because they’re the best in the game, however I got help for around half of the rest of the bosses. However I think you should enjoy it if you feel ready to master the game mechanics, or atleast get to grips with them. And don’t feel bad if you need to get help from online co-op, this game is hard, and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. There are people that will say your trash at games if you got help, and that you ruined the whole game. Don’t listen to them.",8,2023-09-16,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Each boss has personality and a method of defeating them that, when discovered, fills you with satisfaction and a sense of accomplishment.

La sensación de estar perdido y solo en el mundo hace que cada uno se pueda centrar en crear a su personaje de forma inmersiva (tú personaje no sabe nada, por lo que tú tampoco). La historia está fragmentada en cientos de objetos, lo que le añade misterio. El diseño de enemigos normales como de jefes es perfecto y propio de una obra maestra como lo es este título.

But I managed to get past them and overcome those dogwater bosses and get to great ones. Though Pontiff does technically have a clone he's actually one of the good ones. I'm in the minority for saying this, but I appreciate that this game is more linear. I get lost in these games so easily but I didn't need a guide at all for this one. In summary: After getting to the good bosses I ended up loving the game. I love FromSoftware.

La jugabilidad está muy pulida respecto a los dos anteriores, el diseño artístico de los jefes es memorable, la banda sonora es épica y el diseño de niveles es un desafío perfectamente medido para ser complejo y satisfactorio a partes iguales. Como único defecto, solo puedo señalar que el mapa no está tan cuidadosamente diseñado como en el primer Dark Souls, dando una sensación de una excesiva linealidad por momentos. Sin embargo, no solo es uno de los mejores juegos de From Software, sino que posiblemente es uno de los mejores juegos de la Historia.

Aqualonuss,"So es wird Zeit, dass dieser Review das gleiche widerfährt, dessen Schicksal auch alle anderen guten alten Spiele, oder Resident Evil 3, teilen. Ein REMAKE muss her. Jeder kennt es, fast jeder hat es schon einmal gespielt, und viele lieben es. Das ""schwerste Spiel aller Zeiten"" (aka. Dark Souls). Ich liebe diese Reihe und Dark Souls III gehört zu meinen absoluten Top Spielen, weshalb sich diese Review vielleicht so anhört, wie ein K-Pop Fangirl, dass dir versucht zu erklären warum BTS, die beste Band aller Zeiten ist. Im Vergleich mit seinen Vorgängern, hat Dark Souls III, eine etwas schnelleres Kampfsystem und eine wesentlich lineareren Aufbau was für den einen schlecht, für den anderen gut sein kann. Die Bosse und ihrer Inszenierungen sind bombastisch und gehören zu der Spitze der Reihe. Die Gebiete sind abwechslungsreich und schön düster gestaltet, was den Reiz am Spiel ebenfalls ausmacht. Der Soundtrack ist wundervoll und es gibt nichts was mehr mitreißender ist, als den Schlägen eines fast besiegten Bosses auszuweichen, während im Hintergrund eine aufbrausende Musik ertönt. Das Kampfsystem ist grandios, denn nicht umsonst ist es der Maßstab für gute RPG Kämpfe. Die DLCs sind auch empfehlenswert, wobei mich vor allem das zweite, sehr gepackt hat und mir endlos viele Stunden meines Lebens beim bekämpfen eines bestimmten Drachen genommen hat. Beim erneuten Durchspielen entdeckst du immer wieder neue Gebiete und durch seine verschiedenen Klassen und Spielweisen, wird es auch nach dem 8ten Run, nicht langweilig Also zum Abschluss, grandioses Spiel, grandiose Reihe.

ZangBang,"88/100 Dark Souls 3 chooses to focus on a more contained exploration than its predecessors, a much more streamlined map with few branching paths and thus less secret areas and less freedom given to the player on where to go next. This design philosophy allows each new area to be bigger and wide-ranging, but the lack of a tangled web of interconnecting paths like in the past diminishes the sense of freedom granted by exploration, and a slight overabundance of bonfires hurts the sense of tension, ultimately making the journey through Lothric significantly less adventurous than the one through Lordran or Yharnam. Nevertheless, the level design within each area remains of superb quality, as the traditionally multilayered dense map structure is chockfull of treasures and secrets to find and, as previously mentioned, the bigger scope of each area grants more room to explore. The combat system received a clear influence from Bloodborne, as it has a much faster pace now that ultimately ends up making rollspam a little overpowered, but with the usual focus on shielding and weight typical of the Dark Souls, and a magic system now better integrated with the rest of the mechanics. Testing our mettle with these systems, a traditionally excellent, fairly challenging set of enemies and an even better set of bosses. Dark Souls 3 hosts the absolute best, most high-quality array of bosses in the whole Soulsborne series. They frequently display incredibly distinct multiple phases and utilize varied attack patterns that rely on exclusive mechanics or unique playstyles that constantly challenge the player in new exciting ways. Even the worst ones are still highly entertaining thanks to interesting gimmicks that twist the usual formula without compromising on challenge. Narratively, Dark Souls 3 ends the trilogy with a somber, melancholic conclusion that delves deeper into the established concepts of the series, with a main focus on the human drama and tragedies linked to them.",8,2022-10-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user

BobsityJonesity,"A near-perfect end to a legendary series. This game is an improvement on nearly all accounts from the first and second game and hits back on all the themes presented. It starts out a little slow but quickly ramps up, especially near the end. Almost every boss has incredible polish that blows the first and second game out of the water and holds its own against bloodborne. The pace is much faster, which while making the combat feel different from 1 and 2, also allows for more fluidity and dynamic action. The DLCs follow in the soulsborne tradition in being the best part of the game's experience. While the ashes of Ariendel felt somewhat lackluster (except the sister Friede fight which I think is the best in the series), the Ringed city was easily my favorite DLC experience from any souls game, sporting compelling gameplay sections with groundbreaking bosses, 3 of which (Demon Prince, Midir, and Slave Knight Gael) have legitimate claims to be called best in the series. All in all Dark Souls 3 is the perfect conclusion for a legendary franchise and easily the best the series has to offer.",10,2022-08-20,PLAYSTATION 4,user

9bb,This is from the perspective of a returning souls player. The bosses are very well designed. Bosses like Geal and pontiff really set the bar high and first seem like insurmountable challenges. Personally I wouldn’t actually mind more gimmick bosses. Like in demon souls. This is because while dark souls 3 bosses certainly are good. Few of hjem actually stand out. In demon souls bosses like maiden astrea felt really unique and memorable. A lot of bosses in demon souls were about outsmarting your foe this is something that has been lost. And I don’t think it would hurt dark souls 3 to experiment once in a while instead of all the bosses being about dodging at the right time. Not that the bosses in ds3 are bad its just that variation helpes. Another problem is that dark souls has a bit of an identity crisis. It has the setting and themes of dark souls with abit of bloodbourne dna. With references to demon souls dark souls and dark souls 2 every thirty minitues or so. Ds3 feels like it tries to be a best of dark souls arcade game. While this may sound good on paper. I think it works against the game and makes it feel like it doesn’t have an identity of its own. The level design of ds1 has not carried over. Some may like this many wont. The aesthetics are very grey. But they are supposed to be this way. Some may like it some may not. But over all it is still an incredibly good game. The bosses are still really good. The combat is very simple yet engaging. The world is for the most times well crafted. And I do recommend it,8,2022-07-29,PLAYSTATION 4,user

QilBoy,"Dark Souls III is an incredibly precise, elegant and fresh way to end this series. It takes (almost) all of the elements that made the previous installments great, and scales back or removes altogether (most but not all) of the series' weaknesses, resulting in what is unquestionably the overall best Dark Souls experience ever. Firstly: let's talk about the Level Design. The world interconnectivity of DS1 never came back, alas, and even the constant branching pathways that were still very much present in DS2 have been mostly lost: the progression through the game world of DS3 is more linear than it has ever been. This design choice makes the journey of DS3 feel a little less player-driven than the previous two, but it also comes with two great improvements: firstly, by streamlining the progression FromSoftware had better control over the difficulty curve of the experience, and secondly, the world doesnt really NEED many branching paths since the areas themselves are now IMMENSE: i got lost within DS3 areas way more than I ever did in the previous two entires. Areas are huge, vast playgrounds full of twists and turns, hidden rooms and caves, with a greater focus on vertical exploration. So in the end, although we'll miss the replayability value and feeling of agency that was lost by removing the old, web-like world map progression, the trade-off was necessary to receive these new wide-ranging more open Areas. A very much still missed feature is the amount of Estus flasks being linked to each specific bonfire, upgradable through use of Humanities in DS1. That mechanic granted players the agency to manage their resources to make each section a little easier, adding a captivating long-term layer of strategy and resource management. By comparison, the Embers raising HP in DS3 IS an interesting feature, but nothing exceptional. Going over to combat: the fights in DS3 have a much faster pace than previous entries, with your attacks being much quicker and enemies more aggressive and with longer combos. This isnt an improvement or a flaw per se, it is a change that will land differently on each player depending on personal preference, but this new speed of movement makes the roll an excessively powerful option, trivializing some (not that many) fights. The quality of the enemies themselves returns to the greatness of DS1, especially in regards of bosses. Unlike the lackluster, awkward bosses of DS2 (for the most part) or the mixed bag that was DS1, DS3 offers the overall highest quality array of bosses of the entire trilogy, with non-stop challenging, exciting bossfights that almost always offer something to test the player's reflexes and adaptability in satisfying ways, up until the credits roll. To face these enemies the game offers you, as per usual, a pleasantly rich selection of different weapons, with many different combo attack animations, to suit different playstyles, now with even specific abilities tied to each weapon expanding the replayability factor and personalized nature of the experience. Backstabs have been nerfed excessively, and some balancing issues are still present, but nothing as terrible as Magic in DS1. Another unpleasant return (at this point, sadly, a tradition) is the ability of the enemies' weapons to go through walls and obstacles, whereas the player's cannot. NPC Questlines have always been a charming and immersive way to give more weight to the player's journey. By witnessing the personal tragedies of some of the wandering personalities that inhabit this land, you learn more of the world and its history, or simply get entertained, moved and surprised through small little moments inbetween your own quest. DS3 is a return to form compared to the scarce and dull NPC Questlines of DS2, with many NPCs to meet and many stories to watch unfold. But unlike DS1, in DS3 the time windows and criterias to meet most of these NPCs are waaay to narrow and strict: as a result, players will miss out on 50% (if not more) of these encounters, and therefore entire Questlines, whereas DS1 was much more forgiving, giving plenty of time to meet most of these characters. Or, in other words: Dark Souls III is an excellent way to end the franchise. The world map is a lot less interconnected than it used to be back in the DS1 days, sadly, with a more streamlined progression, but the quality of Level Design within Areas themselves is higher than ever, and the more streamlined nature allows for a more precise difficulty curve. Bosses are almost all of extremely high quality, the best collection of the entire series. The more fast-paced combat rhythm gives the adventure a breath of fresh air compared to previous chapters, and it's best balancing of the series thus far (not perfect still). But some of the series' traditional flaws still refuse to die (like enemy strikes going through walls), while some new ones emerge (like an excessively generous roll that rewards roll-spam a little too much)",8,2022-06-05,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Dwideshrude1,"Let me preface this by saying, READ the user reviews. Theres bots, many saying the same thing, giving it a 10/10. Im not saying From did it, but I'm also Not saying they Didnt. Now, onto how this game was developed- They read all the hate Dark Souls 2 got for being boring lazy and easy, so they just said ""screw it"" and copy and pasted bloodborne enemies until its impossible to even move without 6 (of the same exact) enemies pushing you up against a corner. Just extremely lazy attempt at ""difficulty"", when 1 on 1, the enemies are easy as hell. Its just awful. You cant fight 3 bloodborne dogs and 3 enemies that can teleport and spam magic. Or any of the other examples of awful, literally unwinnable enemy placement. That isnt combat. Thats just lazy. Oh. And theres of course things you will never find unless you look them up on google (google -aka fromsofts excuse for a quest guide), but I **** you not, theres a weapon that you need to kill a boss, and there 0 way youd ever know how to use it without looking it up. Literally 0 indication of what to do, how to use it, anywhere in the game. You hold down L2 to use weapon skills right? Obvious. Great. But would you ever think to hold it down for SIX SECONDS WHEN THERE A BOSS RUNNING AT YOU? 6 S E C O ND S??? Thats just bad game design. You cant damage a MAINLINE BOSS unless you GUESS to hold down L2 for SIX SECONDS. (YOU DONT HAVE 6 seconds except for ooonnnneee moment in the fight) I mean cmon guys. Everyone knows that you cant excuse that. Oh. And when you beat that boss, you get teleported to the next one. Youd think, oh if I die, I'll just get to retry, right? hahahahahaha what are you, logical? This is Fromsoft. You die, and then get sent back to the last bonfire. So you go back to the boss room, and theres a bonfire **** where ****.... boss? Youknow? The one i just fought? Can i figure out where it is? Ask someone in the game surely? No. Oh. Its that bad, huh? I have to reach out to the ""Fromsoft Quest Guide( ****)"" oh, but nobody has actually played this far and there misinformation everywhere, nowhere can i find where to go. Lol but 10/10. Maybe play the game before going onto message boards to defend the indefensible. Speaking of indefensible- the input lag, queuing, and hitboxes. As we have seen more recently with the terrible dropped inputs and hitboxes of Sekiro, and the awful input queuing and dodge lag of Elden Ring, clearly whoever used to be in charge of making that aspect feel smooth just isnt at the company any more. It feels extremely clunky, and it only got worse when Elden Ring iterated upon it.This game was when it started to rear it's ugly head ot seems. And its a shame that their older games have better dodge mechanics and less input lag. Technology should improve. And there isnt an excuse. Another thing- Balancing and progression- a foreign term to this development team. I'm on the final boss and I just realized the **** stick with a couple nails sticking out of it (from the beginning of the game) is literally more powerful than any other weapon, whether from a Lord or not. That's not balancing. Sorry. You know what else is dumb? How for about 50% of the game, your best move is developing into the vitality stat, to up your equip load and damage negation, as every other stat has a crazy low first soft cap. It's almost as if they didnt play their own game lol So, anwyays, I beat this game. It felt extremely hollow, as the last boss is just completely down to RNG and input lag whether you can win, and I beat with a **** stick, since it was stronger than weapons enchanted with godly powers.

Il punto di forza del titolo in questione, nonostante la sua qualità tecnica non elevata, viene compensato sia dalla sua magistrale direzione artistica, sia dalla sua lore complessa e, soprattutto, dai boss e dalle maestose colonne sonore che offre.

Tikur,"Overrated piece of ****, that's what this game is. I only rate it 5/10 because it is better than the first Dark Souls I tried out before. From Software and their Soulslikes are the most overrated garbage the Videogame Industry has produced. The world design is at the beginning confusing and not as good as fanboys say. You can easily miss a bonfire, where you can save your progress if you don't use a guide or watch a walkthrough. On top, the game doesn't tell you anything. only the basic controls. Where is the next bonfire? Find it out by yourself. Which weakness have the enemy or boss you face? Find it out by yourself. This game is only popular because of the internet and not because it is actually good. The game design is horrible, it is okay that you lose all your souls, when you are dying, because without this mechanic you could easy grind your way through. However losing your used resources like items to add elemental damage to your weapon is really bad, because not all missed tries are your fault. The game has bugs and glitches that are making the fights even more difficult. The enemies can hit you through walls and they are able to harm you through the fog you step through to challenge the boss. This is ridiculous. That there are no bonfires right in front of the bossroom, so that you can straight go into the fight again is a **** joke. You have to fight on your way the same **** enemies again and when you try to avoid them and run away, they can still hurt you even if you do manage to reach the boss as I mentioned before.

ZackH25,"One of the best level designs I have ever seen in any game. Each area is uniquely designed with its own enemies, environment and story. The combat in the game is vastly improved from the first two, its bosses are the best the series have seen especially its dlc. The best boss is either the Pontiff Sultvahn or Slave Knight Gael. The best area is Ithril of the Boreal Valley. So many great enemies in this game and all of them are such a threat. The level of customisation in ways you can play has also been improved as there are more weapons such as weapons from killing bosses and there are more spells and such. Overall a masterclass of game design.",10,2023-05-04,XBOX ONE,user
slimetalk,"First off I highly recommend playing this on a Series console and not an Xbone. The frame rate boost makes a world of difference. Anyhow… great bosses, fun weapons, build variety is all here. The bosses in particular really shine, there are very few boss encounters that i don’t look forward to. The humanoid ones are very fun to fight, they are fast and aggressive to keep you on your toes. My only real complaint is that locales in the first half of the game are just kinda meh. High wall is cool, but nothing you haven’t seen in a Souls game before. Undead settlement..I mean who cares honestly? Bland, dull, dreary, and grey. Farron Keep/Road of Sacrifices/Crucifixion woods… they all kinda blend together to create a generally uninteresting forest-y swamp area. it just feels like a slog to get through. Also why get rid of power stancing? :(",9,2023-05-04,XBOX ONE,user

Kio22,"Dark Souls 3 is a great game the story surrounding the world is amazing and fun to figure out. The characters all have a purpose that contributes to the overarching story. The levels while linear are still fun to playthrough and explore. The environments are gorgeous and have a sense of scale that make your journey feel epic. The combat is amazing and extremely rewarding once you get use to it. The weapons and armor are great, but the build diversity is slightly lacking in this game compared to Dark Souls 2. The bosses in this game are the best overall of any of the souls games most are challenging and fun, some have gimmicks which is okay, and one or two throw multiple enemies which is fine since it feels different. Overall, just a really good game and probably the most consistent souls game of them all with something for everyone.",9,2023-03-26,XBOX ONE,user

Slayer0027,"Dark Souls 3 was my first soulslike, it took me 12 days to beat it because I was being really careful to not make my experience harder than it was already going to be, and I played with a 100% walkthrough I found on Youtube, so I did almost everything, got 36 achievements (GT: WarSlayer007), the only ones I didn't were those related to collectibles. All the bosses, areas and items collected in roughly 80 hours, lvl 339 and a new best game I've ever played. Yes, Dark Souls 3 is now the game of my life, the feelings it gave me were so amazing and unique that I could never successfully explain, I never thought I'd be able to play a soulslike, I'm a casual player in the sense I like games more “accessible”, in which I don't have to worry about dying a lot and fighting tough enemies, thus it was really rewarding finishing this game given the fact I was afraid of having wasted my money when I bought it, and holy **** when I finally beat the final boss the satisfaction and hapiness I felt were so damn awesome, guess this is what these games are all about, overcome your limitations.

bruhgamer,"This is my favorite soulsborne game and i have beat it about 4 times and i am on my 5th run. The bosses are quite hard but overcoming them is the best feeling ever. I made sure to beat every single boss in the game in each run to see how hard they are. The level design is better than dark souls 2 and dark souls 1, There are shortcuts from bonfires to boss rooms that you will find out later. The setting and the world is very dark and gritty and it has an element of horror to it. Some bosses are quite creepy and there are giant rats and even a **** giant spider. This game has different varieties of swords, spells, armors which you purchase using a currency called souls or soul points which you earn from killing enemies and collecting dead knights' souls. The game doesn't teach you much about how everything works and you have to figure out where to go and which boss you should fight, but dont worry, the linear paths might help you for the most part. The game has an alternate ending which you can find it out by yourself or watch a tutorial. The last boss in the game is quite familiar if you have played dark souls 1. Some minor flaws are the awful frame rates on xbox one and the loading times. These issues arise even after 5 years and sekiro runs better on xbox than dark souls 3. New journey 2 is quite easy as it is like a reward to you after you beat the first journey. Some bosses can be cheesed and there are input delays which are quite frustrating as dodging attacks require precise timing. The character creator menu in the beginning is awful and making the most charming or a badass character would be quite hard, but that wont be a problem if you are wearing knight armor or something.

Professorfett,"The pain, oh the pain feels so good! Hello folks Brandon here being unusually masochistic this month with Dark Souls 3. I adore the Souls games, but unlike some of you badass gamers out there I can only ever get half way. Basically I wish I was just better at the games. The idea of the Dark Souls 3 is intriguing to me. Challenging gameplay with a hidden story and death that actually has meaning. Almost three weeks I’ve been at this **** and I’ve barely scratched the surface of it, but time continues to go on and so do the new games so this review is basically the first third of the game. (I killed the first Lord of Cinder) The games story from my understanding is that these Lords of Cinder don’t want to relight the flame of the world so your job is to go in and kill them. I think so you can relight the world I am not a hundred percent. Seriously you paste the game together by talking to people so if you are paying attention to literally everything around you then you can make up your story so that is what I did. My story is about Jerry the mercenary potter. He was looking for the nearest convenience store when suddenly these naughty Cinder Lords said his mom was a fat cheeky divvy. Not knowing what it meant (whether good or bad) Jerry decided that he would kill these Lords and use their ashes to make a wonderful pot for his defiantly none cheeky or divvy mother. That was my story what is yours you made up while playing this game? The game looks beautiful, and for those of you who are unfamiliar with Dark Souls being able to see a place in the distance and knowing, “at some point I’m going to die there” is marvelous. A weird issue I have is the preset faces all look like the bastard offspring of Gollum. They all are horrific looking so say if you wanted to make a cool adventurer you are going to half to spend some time in the character creation. The soundtrack during the boss fights as always are epic. You really feel like each boss encounter is one to be remember. In in most games the badass audio only kicks in towards the end, but Dark Souls each boss is the final boss in some way. The gameplay is so unique you can honestly say it plays like a Souls game. For those who don’t know Souls games they are a RPG’s with no forgiveness…well some. There is so much to this game the basics are you get souls for killing your enemies and if you die you go back to the spawn point which is a bonfire. When you die or rest at a new/same bonfire ever enemy (excluding bosses) comes back to life so you will have to fight them again. If you die all the souls you had dropped, and if you die without picking them up you lose them. The souls are money/experience so you really don’t want to lose them. Since Dark Souls can be played a number of different ways I will only be talking about how my character was being played. I picked a class called mercenary he is one of seven classes I think. I played the game as a sword and shield fighter with light on the shield. The shields in this game are only really good for parrying (which is a pain in the ass) or blocking projectiles. My main skills were all close range of course with my focus being on evading. I will admit I ran a lot through this game. If I didn’t have to fight an enemy there is a good chance I didn’t. This could be a hindrance, but **** is it less frustrating to deal with. I had some help from an online co-op partner on the first Lord of Cinder, and I must say if you have an issue with a boss call some help. Some people are ****ing monsters in this game. I am more of a scared…potter (sticking with that joke) I met some allies throughout the story which is nice but they usually **** right off after you say hi. The game is so long I am only 12 hours into it and barely scratched the surface so those who don’t get many games keep that in mind. Overall the game is fantastic with no bugs that I saw and gameplay that can sometimes be a pain, but in the end is super satisfying when you do what you thought impossible. I recommend those who know this game series to go buy it I enjoy it more than Dark Souls 1 and 2. It is the best in the series which is rare for the third game to be. I give this a 4.5 out of 5. With the caveat that you know this game is going to bat you around for a bit until you get used to the world. It has a learning curve so if you aren’t into spending sometime of getting your ass kicked then maybe skip this game, or rent to see if maybe this is a good fit for you. I end this with a simple request. Tell me your experience with this game good or bad I love a good gaming story of failure or conquer. Also whether or not you enjoyed it.",9,2020-04-21,XBOX ONE,user

It makes the player immersed in a way I've never felt before, with its beautiful environments and cinematic music. If I could, I would give dark souls 3 a 11 out of 10. If the franchise scared you off in earlier games, or if you struggled with the first part of the game, go back and give it another go, because when you get drawn in you really won't put the game down until you've beaten it 5 or 6 times.",10,2020-02-02,XBOX ONE,user

You can help others or fight against them. But the main reason of this game having a 10 is the design of each enemy and bosses. They all give a powerful feeling that makes you tiny while fighting against them. I totally recommend it for everyone.

HSuke,"Dark Souls 3 is a huge improvement on DS 1. Enemies are still brutal and punishing, but the environment no longer cheeses you out of nowhere. The new ability to fast-travel between bonfires was a well-needed addition. Boss battles are faster and more intense. Almost all enemies (including bosses) can now be stunned if you break their pose, so they seem more realistic than in DS 1, where most enemies acted like impenetrable walls with a health bar. It's still a hardcore game, but it no longer feels arbitrarily unfair. Story plot elements are also better-explained than in DS 1, which required a detective to piece everything together. Also, the graphics are gorgeous. I love how you can always see elements from other sections of the game in the distance.

Locke_Cole,"Es el segundo Dark Souls que termino (DS II me frustró mucho, y aunque lo dejé muy avanzado, no lo llegué a terminar) y sin duda creo que es el más pulido y mejor llevado de la trilogía. Llevando eso por delante no puedo si no aplaudirlo por depurar un concepto de juego tan extraño y a la vez atrayente. Todo lo que tiene que ver con la idea del juego en sí es una virtud, la narrativa segmentada, el miedo a la muerte como principal amenaza al jugador, la curiosidad descubrimiento, la experimentacion con las clases y el equipo, los ****. Todo lo que hace a un Dark Souls un Dark Souls está perfectamente pulido. Sin embargo si que le veo fallos al concepto, algunos de ellos no menores, que no me permiten darle el 10. Primero sigo pensando que hay momentos de este juego donde no puedes sobrevivir sin haber muerto antes varias veces, y aunque en general el juego es mas exigente que difícil, aún hay ciertas amenazas que no puedes afrontar, más por no verlas venir que otra cosa. No son tantas pero están ahí, hay gente que esto le gusta, pero no es mi caso. Por otro lado no me agrada que pierdas gran parte de la experiencia del juego si no pagas el gold, no es que sea completamente necesario (puedes matar por ti mismo a los jefes si tienes la habilidad) pero es poner una barrera extra para disfrutar de todo lo que ofrece el juego. El rendimiento técnico en sí tampoco es estelar, pero no hubieron momentos en que me incomodara, mas allá algunos bugs que sufrieron los enemigos. Creo que esta es la entrega mas recomendable de la saga, mantiene los elementos que hicieron grande a la primera entrega, y agrega otros que sirven para depurarla. Es un gran juego que recomiendo a cualquiera que pueda con la frustración de ciertos segmentos donde, sinceramente, dan ganas de romper el mando.",9,2018-04-06,XBOX ONE,user

SmithurstL,"As much as I can't stop myself from investing time into this game, it's not quite as Dark Souls as it should be. First off, people favored Bloodborne over Dark Souls II for it's unique weapons, and their unique movesets. It is the same with Dark Souls III over Dark Souls II. People never really looked into the weapons and their special abilities, and that they had a cost to use them, much like DS3. This game was favored in light builds, and still is, giving them invincibility when they roll, and forcing shield blockers to suffer more stamina damage, poise is non-existent and the servers aren't as strong as in DS2. One critical hit has the potential to kill someone dressed as havel with a massive health pool. Even worse, rolling takes too little stamina. You can attack as much as you want and have enough stamina left to roll twice. Also, people complain that DS2 requires a stat to be able to use iframes, when it clearly balances the game, and those that have refused to invest in it don't understand the value of the stat, and further complain about the damage of enemies. Finally, I only continue to play this game for DS2 no longer holds multiplayer potential. It is a key mechanic, which I have finally gotten used to and I still prefer the scraps I get from DS2.",4,2017-05-04,XBOX ONE,user

JacksonAkson,"Apparently there are a lot of people who enjoy this game. I am not one of them. My time playing was around two hours, before I quit and deleted the game from my console. Perhaps two hours is not enough to justify a review, so take it for what it is worth, but it was at least an hour longer than I wanted to play it. I found the game to be complete and utter Sega Genesis level garbage. My graphics didn't even remotely resemble on-line photos of the game. I saw no resemblance to an RPG nor any point to what I was doing - just wander around and hack things. Hack the bigger thing and get to go through a gate to hack some more things. Who am I? What am I? What am I trying to accomplish? Why am I hacking things? Why are they hacking me? No idea.",0,2017-04-01,XBOX ONE,user

Any one who has fallen in love with the series knows it is highly original and doesn't quite play like any other game in the industry. Yes, its that great, complex, challenging, and beautiful. There are other more ""narrative"" heavy RPGs out there, for people who like campy fantasy stories and dialogue options, but DS has never been about that. Action, creativity, excellent multiplayer features, and ridiculous replay value due to sheer depth make it hard for any other RPG to come close to touching how satisfying and immersive DS3 is to play.",10,2016-10-23,XBOX ONE,user
Z_whites,"Lets start off with that Dark Souls 3 is a fantastic achievement for From Software, it is a well polished game with tight controls, amazing graphics, and well designed bosses and locations The Good Dark souls 3 doesn't strafe from the tried and true dark souls formula its proven to work so im happy that its not changed although it does feel more like BloodBorne then Dark Souls 1 in which I only mean that it is a faster paced more graceful combat. It also is a gorgeous looking video game draw distance in impressive the environments are impressive in scale and in variety. the weapons armour both new and old look fantastic. The music is spot on and the boss soundtracks perfectly mix with the encounter( Especially lorian and the last boss ones ;) ) The Bad This isn't really even that much **** but I do wish that the world was more interconnected like Dark Souls 1 was but that's more of a personnel gripe then anything Overall if you loved The souls/Borne series you will love dark souls 3",9,2016-10-11,XBOX ONE,user

Overall, the UI is the best its been, multiplayer seems to work very well for the most part-although there are a number of weapon balance issues, supposedly, however they only seem to be an issue for the top-tier players. A decent player like myself can have tons of fun PvPing with all sorts of weapons, obviously some work better than others depending on your style and skill. The Boss fights are incredibly fun, though a few gimmicky ones left me wanting a little more. I've sunk hundreds of hours into this game, multiple playthroughs with various builds, and its well worth your money. Go buy it now. Game of the Year for 2016.",9,2016-08-18,XBOX ONE,user
Durand1981,"A zero score because it doesn't deserve a rating, i see all these payed reviews PRAISING the game. Saying its innovative what a crock of horse poop, its linear and has more problems than past DS games is missing valuable past functions (such as poise) the proper poise not this half arsed hyper armour crap. Parry is way to easy as it the ease of booting a shield, and front stabbing aka 1HK as it counts as a crit hit. It took way to much away from what made the dark souls games, and turned it into blood borne 1.5 for all platforms. Which is not imo what the dark souls fans were paying for, i don't have a play station 4 and even if i did i wouldn't pay to play this crap again under another name. Even some blood borne players are saying this isn't as good as blood borne mechanically, Well duh I wonder why. Because dark souls wasn't designed to be played as such, you take a massive chunk of its GUTS away what do you think will happen ?",0,2016-08-16,XBOX ONE,user
Penfore,"Dear Dark Souls 3 Haters… You. Yes, you! The one screaming, ""There is no poise!"" and ""They rehashed all the assets from the prior games!"" and other slurs I dare not mention. Tread lightly. You are one. We are hundreds, thousands. Millions. You aren't just IN the minority; you ARE the minority. I don't feel awkward or anxious playing Dark Souls 3 around others, and your words don't affect me. Many others, however, are coming out of their shells for the first time in their lives. This is the first time many are enjoying the beautiful world that has been created for us - and it IS beautiful. Incredibly so. DON'T ruin this for them. We Dark Souls 3 fans may have our differences, but we will not hesitate to come to the aid of our fellow undead, especially against someone who so virulently slurs that which has brought us all together. Don't take this the wrong way. I don't hate you. I don't fear you. I pity you. I'm sorry that you feel this way towards us. I'm sorry that Dark Souls 3 is such a bane to your existence. And I'm sorry that you are missing out on such a wonderful experience. Mostly, though, I'm sorry that you feel the need to go around and publicly chastise and berate others. I'm sorry that, to ensure your own validity, you need to make others feel invalid. I'm sorry that your self-worth is so infinitesimally miniscule that you have to make others feel less-than-human, at least in your own denatured mind, just to feel whole. I am truly sorry that day-in and day-out you have to put up with your worthless, meaningless, Shakespearean tragedy of a life. I ask you politely to cease your unnecessary cries for attention, and instead invite you to join our ranks.

SemenTheGreat,"Dark Souls 3, just like its predecessors (except dark souls 2) fails to disappoint me. It's an almost perfect game, with the best melee combat yet seen in DS. (Don't know too much about magic though. Have never played with a magic build in any of the games). The presentation is jaw dropping, with it's visually stunning world and incredible soundtrack. The voice acting is as always superb, and once again brings its colorful characters to life, making every NPC encounter worth while. The bosses are yet again, for the most part, outstanding, ranging very easy to extremely hard. As I said, the game is almost perfect, which means there are a few things that made it not get a 10. First off: The level design, while it makes for a cohesive and believable world (even more so than DS1), is a bit straight forward. It's not as intricate as in DS 1,which in my opinion is a bit of a shame. The frame rate is also extremely unstable at times, but it doesn't really ruin anything. I never felt cheated because of it. At last, while I don't think this drags the game down, is its lack of originality. The game is a major fan service, something I think people wanted after DS2). Overall, while I think Dark Souls 1 is the superior game, i find Dark Souls 3 much more enjoyable. I can't wait to get into NG+.",9,2016-07-27,XBOX ONE,user

MANDIRIGMA,"DS 3 was my first souls I've ever played. At first, I found it stupid hard, dying on the first boss like 15 times before I finally defeated it. I didn't get comfortable after the 3rd area. Likes: The visuals: Great! FromSoftware really put a lot of effort in making everything look very detailed. The gameplay: Very good. The motions of your character are quite fluid; reaction time is pretty good. Variety of enemies: Tons of different enemies with different attack patterns. Intimidating bosses: I must admit, the bosses are great. They all have different styles and weaknesses so you're virtually forced to employ different techniques for each or some of them. And if you immerse yourself into the game, they are appalling and demoralizing to behold! Adrenaline rush: kudos to the game designers. There were areas where I felt frightened due to the eerie audio and spooky visuals. My palms were sweaty with 1 or no estus left, looking for the next bonfire that I knew should be nearby somewhere. Now for the dislikes... Tutorial: Virtually none. Beginners learn the hard way x 5. NPC Questlines: Stupid questlines. There's no indication that an NPC has a questline. There's no indication how to trigger it nor what the objective is. No indication how to progress. If you don't read forums you won't know where to go to progress them. One can fail a NPC questline without even knowing it. And the reason for the failure is not transparent and makes no sense. One questline in particular will affect the ending -- and if you don't google it, you will be disappointed. let me reiterate -- stupid questlines. Too punishing: I get that a mistake can cause the player big time. But when a small rat stun locks you, that is bs! Plot/Lore: mediocre plot. so many questions, so few answers. Many are left to the player's ""imagination"". Ending: to me the best ending is the normal ending, fulfilling the objective of the game. The so-called best ending by many just doesn't appeal to me. If DS series will continue then maybe it could make sense. But when game creator says nope, no DS sequel plan then how is it the best ending best? All-in-all a good game. Definitely not for the casual gamer. Be warned if you play this -- you will die a lot; you will stress out; you will lose precious souls permanently more than once. If you read forums, you will come across arrogant players that always say ""git gud"".

NGrey5,"Fantastic single player that is just as challenging as it is fun to play. A story line that is interesting so long as you dip into the lore, but if you decide not to, it won't take away from the overall experience. Make your way through some of the most vast and beautifully designed worlds and zones in gaming history. When you first set foot in new territory you find yourself up against challenges that are very much different than the one you just went through, which keeps the overall game engaging and never stale. Online multiplayer that is suspenseful and highly skill based, which gives motive to progressing and leveling up your character in order to get better in combat. However, with matchmaking scaling to whichever level your character is, you will (most of the time) be matched with players of the same skill so that it's not too easy or difficult. There is definitely something special to say about a game that constantly kills and punishes you for making the wrong decisions, but at the same time prompting you to come back for more.",9,2016-05-25,XBOX ONE,user
MrCommonSense,"I really wish that I could rate this game higher I really do but it is just utterly broken in several ways currently and it is ridiculous that it was released in this condition, Essentially barely playable. Matchmaking is horrible and the servers are laggy to the point that most invaders will just glide across the ground without moving, several core features of the game such as weapon scaling some covens and infusement are broken and useless in several instances, NPC scaling is completely broken in some areas and weak enemies will randomly do over 1000 damage with one attack even if you're wearing heavy armor often times instantly killing you out of nowhere, Magic wasn't implemented well and it's a pain in the ass to use according to my friends and for some reason there isn't any freaking poise in the game so literally EVERYTHING will stagger you. Several weapons have phantom range that gives them twice as much reach, You will literally be staggered by almost everything that hits you no matter how high your poise is and hackers and lag switchers are already abundant in PVP and as usual fromsoft isn't doing jack to fix their broken ass product, choosing to ignore the actual problems and do patches that no one asked for instead. This game can be great fun but the amount of sheer **** that fills almost every aspect of it just ruins the experience. I'm honestly considering getting rid of my copy at least until all of the patches are done. And as unbalanced and messed up as this one is that will probably be a year from now. Some idiots will whine and say that i'm a noob even though i've been playing since the first game and that the game is SUPPOSED to be hard. Yeah, No **** you simpletons but the game ISN'T supposed to be broken to the point where you have to cheat and exploit glitches to freaking win. For example i've had people run up to me in pvp and guard break me when I wasn't blocking. I've also had these cheating **** take me into a back stab animation while they were standing right in front of me. The fact that these games are released so broken and borderline unplayable is a joke.",5,2016-05-16,XBOX ONE,user
IMC21,"First of all, I love Dark Souls. I love the first and the third, hell I even love the second one. Dark Souls 3 has it all, its got beautiful graphics, amazing gameplay, fantastic lore, and some very challenging bosses. I think that this game has the most customization in the series, there is a staggering amount of weapons and armor sets, unfortunately, unlike Dark Souls 2, this game has little variety in basic weapon move sets, so many are the same, but I think that they make up for it with the weapon arts. There are so many cool and interesting weapon arts that bring diversity to the way you play. 8.5/10 Now, I am a **** for Dark Souls lore, the lore itself is fantastic, but the way you discover it is even better. The way it presents itself is amazing as it is like you are exploring an ancient civilization, the story is hidden in the item descriptions and environment, if you pay attention to these things you can figure out some stuff as you go. 9/10 Unfortunately, there are somethings that I dislike about Souls games. First, its the areas, after a while they just don't seem fun to me, maybe its because I have run through it a couple of times or that I had a hard time my first play through, but I there are some areas in Souls that I just don't enjoy or I downright hate HATE. Hey, but there are some areas that I just adore. Dark Souls 3 has all of these for me. So the areas... 7/10 So the biggest question I have been asking myself is which is better Dark Souls 1 or Dark Souls 3. I enjoy Dark Souls 2, it was my first Dark Souls game, but its not on par with these guys.

Alex283zs,"From Software nos vuelve a dejar una obra maestra, uno de esos juegos que no hay en la industria actual, uno de esos juegos que agradeces por poder disfrutar y presenciar en una época tan complicada de los videojuegos como la actual. Si eres un veterano de la saga, ya sabes a lo que te enfrentas, o al menos, tienes una idea, si eres nuevo, déjame decirte que estas ante tu videojuego más frustrante y a la vez, más satisfactorio de tu vida gamer. ¿Qué es Dark Souls 3? Más que un juego, es una experiencia, un juego que te enseña la valiosa lección de que perder y/o fallar no es malo, al contrario, para enfrentar ese reto de nuevo y lograr vencerlo. Esa es la alma principal de Dark Souls, Este es un juego único, donde los demás son pura cinemática y mecánicas y dificultad de risa, este juego nos deja libres en un mundo donde tu tienes que descubrir la historia, interpretarla a tu manera y ritmo, donde nada te ayuda a saber que tienes que hacer a continuación, un juego donde, la satisfacción de lograr vencer a ese jefe que estuvo fastidiándote no por horas, por días, es la mayor recompensa de este juego. Durante mis más de 50 horas que dedique a la primera vez que jugué este juego, no puedo estar más satisfecho con mi compra, y con el tiempo que invertí en este, y aun así, a pesar de que investigue todo lo que pude, sin guía ni nada por el estilo, me deje más de la mitad de lo que el juego ofrece en ítems, secretos y demás. Si lo que el equipo de From Software dice sea cierto, que este es el ultimo juego de la saga Souls, es una despedida como se merece, tomando todo lo bueno, mejorando lo ya bueno, y reduciendo los fallos, que aun así hay algunos, pero no son ni lo suficiente para que se noten en este juego. ¿Cómo ser justo con los jugadores nuevos y los veteranos? El juego tiene una dificultad justa para los novatos, que sea difícil, más no imposible, y de total desafío para nosotros los experimentados y curtidos en esta saga. Al igual que un Silent Hill, donde el pueblo es el personaje principal, los escenarios en Dark Souls 3 son bellísimos, con un diseño de arte único, enormes lugares y miles de cosas por descubrir. Fueron muchas veces en las que me detuve a presenciar un paisaje. Este Souls es una carta de amor a los veteranos, ya que hay muchas referencias con el primer juego, y en varias veces me sentí como en casa, pero a la vez, descubriendo cosas nuevas. No cometas el error de desperdiciar tu experiencia usando una guía, solo si de verdad no sabes que sigue, haz uso de una, pero un juego así, merece tu total atención, y no te sentirás decepcionado, a pesar de la frustración y enojo que significa morir una y otra vez, terminar un Dark Souls es una experiencia y satisfacción enorme, y aunque hayas visto y recogido todo del juego, siempre tienes ganas de seguir jugándolo, por que juegos así, ya no hacen. Esto más que una review, es una platica sobre mi experiencia. Desde que se anuncio el juego, la espera era interminable, y no solo valió la pena, supero completamente mis expectativas. ¿Debes comprar Dark Souls 3? Definitivamente, si eres veterano de la saga, por nada del mundo te pierdas esta obra maestra, esta conclusión como se merece una saga que difícilmente volvamos a ver, y que pasara tiempo para ver un juego de su calibre. Si eres nuevo, también, te sentirás perdido, pues la historia es enorme y maravillosa, hay muchas cosas del primer juego que están aquí, y sin duda deberás jugar el primero para mejorar tu experiencia, pero de que lo disfrutaras, eso sin duda. Dark Souls 3 es el mejor juegos de la saga, y el mejor juego de las next gen actualmente, me atrevo a decir que estamos ante el juego del año. Y uno de los mejores de la historia de los videojuegos. 10/10",10,2016-04-30,XBOX ONE,user

GainesvilleGuy,"Fantastic. Played all 3 Dark Souls games and this is the best one. Was actually not that big of a fan of Dark Souls 2 as I thought it wasn't nearly as good as the original Dark Souls. But this third version has re-captured all of that magic from the original and added enough new stuff and with the improved graphics this is now the standard bearer of the Dark Souls series. Even corrected the two biggest mistakes of Dark Souls 2 by getting rid of soul memory and the disappearing monsters (after defeating them multiple times). So dying is never really that big of a loss like in Souls 2 and no worries about missing a drop on mobs that might be disappearing (you can grind them forever if you wish). The atmosphere is brilliant it has the best overall vibe of any game out there and the PVP is as innovative as ever. And for those new to the series who have heard about the difficulty don't be frightened. The difficulty is just right for the type of game it is. This isn't at it's core an RPG like Skyrim or The Witcher (yes there is leveling and armor sets and weapons and upgrades) but it really should be viewed more as a platformer. Think of it as a 3D (3rd person) old school platformer with a seriously cool dark vibe. You have difficult levels followed by boss fights, just like old school Mario games. The fun is beating the levels (navigating thru the map and defeating the monsters along the way) and then taking on the boss before moving on to the next level. The levels can always be beat and are never that frustrating in my opinion. And just like old school platformers when you die you basically start the level over at its checkpoint (with maybe shortcuts unlocked to speed up progress) so this really isn't anything new in terms of difficulty. The only occasional frustrations are some of the bosses, but if you don't have the patience for that all you need to do is summon help and you can defeat them easily (no penalties even). There is no reason to be scared of the difficulty just buy it and enjoy the greatest platformer (with RPG and PVP elements) of all time.",10,2016-04-23,XBOX ONE,user
SadisticUnicorn,"Dark Souls III is the Force Awakens of the Dark Souls series. It knows what made previous games good and what didn't work and makes the positive things better. Nothing drastically new is added meaning the game does feel rather similar to the previous games but this is in no way a bad thing as the formula in place is such a good one. The game play is smooth, the visuals stunning, the lore deep and the sound track hauntingly beautiful. There are however two minor points which I feel holds the game back slightly and prevents me being able to give it a 10. The first is the world which is much more linear than the other games meaning you never really get that feeling of the different parts of the world coming together. The other is the difficulty spread which feels very uneven at times. I found myself being stuck on certain bosses for hours at a time and then breezing through other portions of the game with hardly a death to speak of. Despite these minor issues Dark Souls III is still a difficult, immersive and satisfying experience, the best game of 2016 thus far and undoubtedly a strong GOTY contender.",9,2016-04-21,XBOX ONE,user
Tronske,"FIRST TIME SOULS PLAYER HERE. And wow, I can see what all the hype is about. I've always been intimidated by Dark Souls since everyone always talks about how hard **** it **** I'll admit that it IS a hard **** that does not take away from the fun factor one bit. And i would say that I am the type of person who is not the greatest at video games to begin with. As someone who is a fan of fantasy (The Witcher 3, Lord of The Rings, Game of Thrones etc.) I felt intrigued enough to pick this game up. Great choice. This is the kind of game that you can play for 5 hours and not even know where the time went, and that is a rare occasion for me these days. The graphics look good, it plays fluidly, and some of the enemies are so badass looking that I can't help but admire them as they kill me. I've sunk 16 hours into this game the past week, only beaten 3 bosses, but I'm loving every step of the way. If it's your first time and you're intimidated and worried you are going to keep dying, you WILL keep dying, but you will love it anyways. Pick it up. Just try to learn the basics from Youtube videos or Google since this game does not hold your hand.",9,2016-04-21,XBOX ONE,user
vangoat,"It's beautiful, its challenging, & co-op is much improved. Hopefully you've played before and if so you won't be disappointed, if you are a noob the first boss will teach you exactly what dark souls is all about....punishing you for not learning. Worry not, forage on, because the tides will turn and you yourself will become a **** beast:) If you are having issues connecting to a friend with a password, have both of you return to firelink and then try back at the bonfire of choice, seems to work.

Jaliver,"Dark Souls 3 is a very solid game that arguably is the best in the trilogy by many players. I didn't give this game a 10 because of a few minor tweaks that take away from my own personal experience with the game such as minor frame rate issues and a sometimes very glitchy multiplayer experience. These issues aren't huge issues but when I think of a perfect game I think **** that not only has a perfect atmosphere, story and rich in content but also very smooth play-ability. This is a review I'm willing to update if these issues are resolved but until then I'll give this game a solid 9. Regardless of the minor issues this game is surely one of the better games that will come out of 2016.",9,2016-04-19,XBOX ONE,user

BuffetlineDLX,"This is my first review I've ever done before, and I felt the need to write this as a warning to other gamers. This game is practically unplayable. I've never played a DS game before, but I've heard all the things about this franchise, that it was challenging, but I never thought it'd be a CHORE to play a video game. There is nothing that made me want to play this, because I just ended up yelling at my TV about how ridiculous this game is. If you're someone like me who enjoys a good challenge, but doesn't like a game being so difficult just for the sake of it, avoid this game. If you're looking to escape a few hours after a long day of work and unwind, once again, avoid this garbage. It'll just stress you out even more than work. After about the 20th time being killed by (what I assume to be) a miniboss, I quickly realized this is the dumbest game I've ever played. If I could go back to Gamestop and get a full refund, I would. So long story short, if you play video games to unwind, or just enjoy having fun in general, DON'T buy this crap. If you like doing tedious chores and enjoy the sensation of raising your blood pressure, this game is for you! Average gamer avoid at all costs.",0,2016-04-17,XBOX ONE,user

Cstriker01,"Truly a masterpiece and the Coup de Grace of Miyazaki and Fro msoft. In this case I would strongly contend this is a game of the year contender based off of many reasons; graphical fidelity, sound design, gameplay, and lore. Graphics- Very pretty game, but that is not a selling point here. The immersion and atmosphere of the game is oppressive, bleak, stark, and beautiful at the sametime showing an apocalyptic fantasy world. 30FPS is rarly an issue, but the 60fps on PC is very nice. I typically like to play souls on console but I do own both versions and the PC version fidelity is much higher. That aside, visuals are astounding. Gameplay- Easily the biggest selling point; deep RPG math systems, huge variety in weapons and fashion (FASHION SOULS!), and new mechanics with weapon arts and spells make this a huge entry in RPGs. Enemies and bosses are imposing and dangerous, even being overwhelmed by basic baddies can prove lethal in true souls fashion. Boss design alone deserves a moment; boss phases from Bloodborne has made its way here and rightly so, it fits right in and makes new challenges in the game. Level design is fantastic...note that there is a hub akin to the Hunters Nightmare and the Nexus from Demon Souls. But beyond this areas have hidden spaces and new shortcuts in a less linear design like Dark Souls 2, think more well thought out design of Bloodborne. Sound design- Ambient sounds create an eerie atmosphere, broken by the haunting chorus of the soundtrack during epic boss fights and stunning **** really is an audible feast. Lore- Without spoiling anything, lots of connections to Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2, tons of lore and back store given out piecemeal in true souls fashion, weaving a cryptic tapestry of history and quest. 10/10 hands down, best souls game ever.",10,2016-04-14,XBOX ONE,user

DukeSilver,"Dark Souls 3 is an amazing game from what I've been able to get through so far. Yes the framerate isn't amazing, but the amazing graphics more that make up for it. Almost everything has been improved upon from the first two games. From Software certainly cut away all the small things that made the previous games a bit more annoying than they needed to be, and left the parts that make the series so brilliant. DS III is definitely not easier that either of the first two games which was a bit of a concern of mine going in. The enemies are extremely fun to fight and I'd argue this game has the best boss fight of the series so far. There are even more play styles in this game than previous DS games, which basically means this game has a nearly infinite amount of replay value. One of the best games I've ever played.",10,2016-04-12,XBOX ONE,user

PaulCharles,"What an incredibly talented team From Software has. I started with the Atari, and have played hundreds of games over 30 years, and can honestly say the Souls series is my number one. Yes, I've broken controllers, disturbed my neighbors, and have probably burst a few blood vessels playing these games, but the satisfaction this series gives you after clearing certain areas and bosses makes it all well worth it. Whether you're a veteran, or new to the series, you'll absolutely love this game if you have a little patience and learn from your mistakes. The first thing i noticed with DS3 over the others is how incredibly smooth it is. Dodging has never been so fun! They've added a few things to make the initial start a little less aggravating, without over-doing it and making it too easy. I'm only a couple hours in and cannot wait to get back into the DS universe! Do yourself a favor and take your time as it's the last of the series!

burnit,"Masterpiece. It's genuinely the best finale for a life-changing trilogy. It couldn't be a more perfect ending than DS3. Everything that DS1 did, DS3 took and raised to perfection, I mean, of course, the world design isn't as perfect and circular as the first game. But it's pretty close. The level design was wonderfully built and massively cared for, it's depressive, and frightening when it has to be, and mesmerizing when it has to **** bosses are not the hardest in the trilogy but are generally the cooler. Same for the script, the best run of the series when talking about character/lore development and the most touching and caring finals of the series. I was generally bought in on the final I got. I thought that the character I developed couldn't have gotten a more fitting ending.

kiozen,"""Dark Souls III"" marks a return to the series' roots, blending elements from previous titles with the faster, more dynamic pace of *Bloodborne*. The game delivers a smoother, more refined experience than its predecessors, with quick and responsive combat that grants players greater mobility while retaining the high difficulty that defines the series.Visually, *Dark Souls III* is stunning, featuring detailed gothic environments and a bleak, decaying atmosphere that enhances its dark narrative. The world is intricately interconnected, with areas that link seamlessly and encourage exploration. The boss fights are some of the best in the series, presenting memorable challenges and exceptional designs, ranging from terrifying creatures to majestic **** lore unfolds masterfully, revisiting themes and characters from earlier games and bringing many story arcs to a satisfying close. Multiplayer has also been improved, offering a more fluid experience with PvP and summoning systems, though some invasions can feel a bit **** sum, *Dark Souls III* provides a rich, challenging journey and a fitting culmination of the series, perfect for veterans and newcomers eager to explore its legendary, dark world.",9,2024-11-06,PC,user

tomhanwool1,"Gameplay: 9/10 (Basically, This is Fromsoftware game.) BGM: 8/10 (Personally, I like the Menu Screen Theme the most, the remaining BGMs don't leave much of an impression like Elden Ring and Bloodborne.) Lore: 10/10 (The story about the gods and Chaos Flame is full of Dark Fantasy. The longer I play, the more I want to learn about the game's world and its historical context. The plot has many similarities between Dark Souls and Elden Ring, I like both works.) Design: 7/10 (The boss design is not too impressive to me. Bosses mainly attack with melee weapons and Big Bosses mostly only use slashing attacks. Moveset chains are almost easy to dodge, you only need to die 5-10 times to remember all the movesets. I beat Nameless King and Souls of Cinder in just 15-20 respawns. The costume design and appearance of the bosses did not leave much impression on me. The design of the areas in the game has changed a lot from its predecessors Dark Souls, Dark Souls 3 gives me a lot of impressions with each different area applying great graphics in 2016 and even It's still not outdated now, when I first went to Anor Londo I was fascinated with the scenery of this city.) Weapon and Spell System: 7/10 (I only used one type of weapon while completing the game, which is the Sellsword Twinblades. I think this is the most OP weapon in the game when it combines perfectly with the Rings. Easy to use and easy to upgrade, especially you can pick it up at the beginning of the game, in Boss fights I mostly just roll and spam L1/LB. The other weapons I hardly use are not impressive, the Skill Weapon Boss is also not impressive to me, compared to the Elden Ring that inherits Dark Souls, it's a different story. During the Elden Ring experience, I was very interested and curious about Incantations and Spells, I spent a lot of time searching and collecting them. But for Dark Souls 3, there is no such feeling. Comparing the spells and icantation between Elden Ring and Dark Souls 3, it will definitely be Elden Ring. Perhaps I Elden Ring has left too much of its wonderfulness in me. 7/10 is deserved for it.)

ZAMPAGAMER,"Me gusto un monton, lo que mas, él diseño de los escenarios, algunos claro pero en general son buenos. Los jefes también son increíbles y un diseño espectacular todos. No puedo decir lo mismo de los enemigos normales que aunque si son variados, se repiten hasta en la sopa en todos los mapas y otro factor a tener en cuenta es la poca variedad de builds que hay, me explico. Si quieres una build muy efectiva por todo el juego, pues hay 3 o 4 mal contadas el resto te empezaran a servir ya al final como mucho ni eso. Pero por lo demás yo creo que esta muy bien y algo que no se puede olvidar es que la historia, a mi parecer es muy mala y aburrida, pero el final dando a entender que el enemigo eres tu mismo es increíble y las bandas sonoras del juego mejor ni hablemos porque no hay ni una en el juego que sea mala.

TrueOptimist,"While it has a few modern touches, it still feels like a game from the past. Souls games have it all according to most people and while they have always presented epic boss fights and gorgeous environments, they always lack in one pivotal category for me. That would be quality of life. These games are always missing the little things that would really go a long way and making it so much more enjoyable for the player. I played this quite awhile ago, before Elden Ring, and while that game is the best thing they have created to date, it is also missing those same quality of life tools. Eventually they did add a few to Elden Ring, but this game is still devoid of them. At some point it wouldn't be a Souls game they'd say, if for instance they gave you more information on quests and you had didn't have to scrounge through weapon descriptions to piece together a story, but people will still love it if you did. The story in this one was not to my liking and ended with a whimper as the last boss is no where near one of the best in the game as well as being one of the easier ones to beat as well. Also, bosses to me would be much more interesting if they were used as ways to convey information, but 90% of them don't utter a word to you. I feel like they enjoy staying with their weird little niche game rather than telling a proper story, but at least we see with Elden Ring and Sekiro, we see they are more then capable of doing so when they feel like it.",7,2024-03-11,PC,user

But after putting a lot of time, effort and frustration into it and playing other From Soft titles there is actually an outstanding game with a great atmosphere and fantastic gameplay hidden underneath a huge pile of annoyances, lacking features and unexplained mechanics. For casuals I'd strongly recommend to just play a more fun and accessible modern PC game like god of war any day or (if you are dedicated) to start your From Soft journey with elden ring. For people who are intrigued by From Soft games this is another fantastic title to spend hundreds of hours on. If I had to pick one ""genre"" to play for the rest of my live it would be From Soft titles - for me their gameplay and atmosphere is just unmatched. These aren't normal games this is art.

EKYR,"this is my current favourite souls game (10/7/23) and i just love the boss fights, excellently crafted atmosphere that fromsoftware was able to present to us, it plays and feels the best to me. My first dark souls game and i really love it! DARK SOULS 3 is a pretty good game i have played elden ring sekiro and bloodborne prior to this and i still think they ae better than dark souls 3. The game itself is fluid with amazing boss battles and interesting characters, i was able to feel immersed in the story although it is confusing. I think this game can be recommended to poeple wanting something similar to elden ring and like the combat style. Some flaws in the game in my opinion is that it often feels very frustrating to get past bosses and the late game is really unfair, with even common enemies able to deal a ton of damage. it doesnt feel as strong as elden ring or bloodborne because some of its level design is really boring. The level design makes me feel very burned out and often i find myself feeling very done with the game. I would consider this game to be an 8/10. EDIT SOON alright after doing 2 endings and both dlcs, my opinion has changed abit. This game's DLCs are really good and makes up for some of the boring areas in the main game like 2 of the starting areas, but near the end it is really good and the dlcs are memorable and add to the experience. 9/10, what a game!",10,2023-07-11,PC,user

The story is good but somewhat vague to me (Maybe because I don’t know the story of Dark Souls 1). The world-building, finding secrets, and spooky environment make it a typical FROMSOFTAWRE game. The enemy and boss design is fantastic. One this I didn’t enjoy very much is the combat mechanism. It’s too SLOW compared to Bloodborne and Sekiro. The dodging is slow and parrying is petty hard to get, even attacking takes 1sec to initiate. Maybe the game is OK and my build was trash, I don’t know. But for now, this game is not getting a perfect score from me. I will definitely revisit the game with a different build and then reconsider my score again.",8,2023-06-22,PC,user

Crimson9,"While Dark Souls 3's plot, locations, and atmosphere are all essentially a nostalgia trip for Dark Souls 1 fans, interestingly not much of the original game's DNA is here otherwise. Whereas DS1 was about exploration and nonlinearity, DS3 is very linear in level design and progression. DS1's gameplay loop was in managing resources as you made your way through a dangerous world, whereas DS3's levels are merely speedbumps on the way to the reward - an incredibly designed boss. DS1 had clunky but slow paced, deliberate combat. DS3 is a roll spam simulator. Overall, this game has turned the franchise into a fast paced action-RPG, instead of a slow-paced exploration RPG with action elements. It is still very good. The boss fights are the best in the game. The lore and NPCs are still great. The ending is satisfying and the music is incredible. But it does really miss a lot of what made the first game brilliant, and trades it for flashiness and accessibility.",7,2022-11-28,PC,user

Aqualonuss,"So es wird Zeit, dass dieser Review das gleiche widerfährt, dessen Schicksal auch alle anderen guten alten Spiele, oder Resident Evil 3, teilen. Ein REMAKE muss her. Jeder kennt es, fast jeder hat es schon einmal gespielt, und viele lieben es. Das ""schwerste Spiel aller Zeiten"" (aka. Dark Souls). Ich liebe diese Reihe und Dark Souls III gehört zu meinen absoluten Top Spielen, weshalb sich diese Review vielleicht so anhört, wie ein K-Pop Fangirl, dass dir versucht zu erklären warum BTS, die beste Band aller Zeiten ist. Im Vergleich mit seinen Vorgängern, hat Dark Souls III, eine etwas schnelleres Kampfsystem und eine wesentlich lineareren Aufbau was für den einen schlecht, für den anderen gut sein kann. Die Bosse und ihrer Inszenierungen sind bombastisch und gehören zu der Spitze der Reihe. Die Gebiete sind abwechslungsreich und schön düster gestaltet, was den Reiz am Spiel ebenfalls ausmacht. Der Soundtrack ist wundervoll und es gibt nichts was mehr mitreißender ist, als den Schlägen eines fast besiegten Bosses auszuweichen, während im Hintergrund eine aufbrausende Musik ertönt. Das Kampfsystem ist grandios, denn nicht umsonst ist es der Maßstab für gute RPG Kämpfe. Die DLCs sind auch empfehlenswert, wobei mich vor allem das zweite, sehr gepackt hat und mir endlos viele Stunden meines Lebens beim bekämpfen eines bestimmten Drachen genommen hat. Beim erneuten Durchspielen entdeckst du immer wieder neue Gebiete und durch seine verschiedenen Klassen und Spielweisen, wird es auch nach dem 8ten Run, nicht langweilig Also zum Abschluss, grandioses Spiel, grandiose Reihe.

Este a diferencia del segundo dark souls que se aleja por completo del lore del primer juego este si continúa con la historia, sin embargo el juego a veces pierde identidad por tener mucho fanservice. Pese a tener mucho fanservice y no haber superado al primero en algunos aspectos Dark souls 3 supo como dar una conclusión perfecta para la trilogía, lo recomiendo sin ninguna duda.",9,2022-10-18,PC,user
CoolBR,"Oh boy, that was the first Souls series game that I've played and I didn't believe it would change my whole gamer view. I never thought I was a player who liked so much difficulty before playing Dark Souls. I always played games on the normal difficulty or maybe in the 2nd higher but Dark Souls you don't have the choice which is a great thing. My first impressions of the game, I was astonished at how good was the combat system. It is indeed a very simple combat system, you don't have many combat moves you can just light, heavy and plunge attack, dodge and defend and parry and use some magic. But the combat system is so polished and accurate you actually feel the weight of your weapon when it collides in the enemy shield and the moves are very precise so when you die you know the mistake was yours alone. The great variety of weapons offsets the lack of combat moves you can characters can do. The exploration and difficulty are both in the same boat. You can die for anything, enemies can come out from a door and kill you by surprise. Enemies on the roof can jump on you and attack you by surprise. You have to be 24/7 alert. And the interesting part is that when you die, you lose your Souls (that are used to level up your character) but if you return to where you died you can retrieve it. That mechanic is so interesting and when you die makes you play safe and strategically to do not lose your souls. The graphics of this game is beautiful (especially Boreal Valley) and each map is unique. Also, the way the game reveals shortcuts as you progress is a masterpiece. So, if the game is so good, why don't you give 10/10? The answer is, I don't like the way the story is told. It isn't for my taste. You play with a character with no story and everything is so philosophical and abstract. Unless you search videos on Youtube, there is a little story in this game and you only can theorize about it. And I am a very story, skewed player. I like games with memorable gameplay mechanics (like Dark Souls) but that also have memorable stories like RDR2, GOW, FC4, etc.",8,2022-10-17,PC,user

На любую локацию всегда можно и вернуться и найти что-то новое на ней. Например - самая первая лока, там где игрок появляется. Когда судья Гундир был давно побеждён мной, я вернулся туда и зашёл в один непримечательный тоннель, он привёл меня к мини-боссу этой локации. И таких секретов там просто навалом. Боёвка в этой игре очень интересная: существуют разные виды мечей, луков, у них есть разные способности. Также есть колдовство и пиромантия для которых есть множество заклинаний. Враги разнообразные, они обладают разными стилями боя. В начале игры боссы не так часто встречаются на твоём пути - но чем дальше ты проходишь, тем их больше.

fake_nikpap,"The end of a series. I can say it's a very fitting end to one of the most memorable series in gaming. It puts things confidently into rest with both its DLC's and tying everything back to the other 2 games. Although it's a bit more linear than the other 2, it helps balance out the difficulty of its areas and also its bosses. This leads to some of the best boss fights in the series by far. I have to say that it's also the most beginner friendly with fast and responsive combat and clear and concise menus. Praise the Sun!!",9,2022-07-14,PC,user

Natharyn,"Dark souls 3 is in my opinion the best game of the souls series. Even though it is the best it comes with it in my opinion it has it flaws especially when it comes to story and PvP. The character creation is fine. You can make a good-looking character or ugly. It gives you somewhat limited options but at the same time can take it quite far with those limits. The story of dark souls 3 in my opinion is lacking. It builds on similar writing of Dark souls 1 which causes the game to have ambiguous and cryptic. This comes from the ambiguous nature of director Miyazaki's way of writing style. The way you get to know the world of dark soul is by reading boss souls and item description. This can be boring or fun depending on the player however I found this tiring and somewhat boring. The music of dark souls III is a hit or miss in my opinion. Some OST in the Dark souls III is good such as Gael and Sister Friede and ariandel music pieces as they flow with the battle. However most of music feels disorganized and overly bombastic such as Vordt’s boss music. The PvE in dark souls 3 is the best part of the game. It has a fast-paced fighting style, and the bosses you fight has a difficulty which is not artificial and feels fair. The normal PvE mobs can be however boring and somewhat repeatable in some areas of the game such as Lothric castle and Grand archives. The PvP is good but also bad. The PvP is good when it works well however when a player has great latency or is cheating the quality of PvP goes down tremendously. The world is divided up in a Japan server and a rest of the world server. This causes those in the rest of the world to have a much harder experience, as two players of different continents can connect with each other but will have a great deal of latency. The game also has a clear cheating problem, as it’s anti-cheat program is lacking in it’s function to catch cheaters. Another problem with the game’s PvP is that some weapons are objectively better then others which causes players to lack diversity in builds and originality.",5,2022-06-22,PC,user
Grize,"The best game in the Dark Souls genre. Most of the bosses are fun but after a lot of hours, they get predictable. The story is ok if you like dark and mysterious storytelling. PvP is the fine worst part is that you can meet anyone from the world except Japan. Balancing is ok but phantom rang is insane but needed. Allot better than Eldenrings PvP at least.

ErayTellezi,"Bazı sanat eserleri insana kendisiyle alakalı bir şey öğretir. Ben soulslike maceram da ne kadar sabırlı olduğumu fark ettim ki kendimi hep tam tersi olarak tanımlarım. Bu üniversitede sınav zamanları bir ay kapanıp ders çalıştığım dönemlerden beri tatmadığım bir duyguydu. 80+ saatin sonunda tüm dlc'lerle birlikte ve opsiyonel bossları keserek, hiç kimseyi summon etmeden, hiç büyü yap(a)madan bitirdim. Bu 80 saat bana normalden çok daha uzun geldi. Bir ara pes edip oyunu bırakmıştım. Bu yolda umutsuzluğa kapıldığım da oldu, kendimle gurur duyduğum da. Ama neticede Antalya sıcakları başlamadan şu oyunları bitirme amacıma tam sınırda da olsa ulaştım. Bir kere bu oyun en adaletsiz olanı. Bazı boss'ları iki kere hatta üç kere öldürmeniz gerekebiliyor. Tamam Sekiro'da da bu vardı ama onda biz de dirilebiliyorduk. Bundaysa üçüncü düşmanın sonunda yaptığınız tek bir hata, savaşa baştan başlamanıza neden olabiliyor ve 50 defa geçtiğiniz ilk fazları tekrar oynamak zorunda kalıyorsunuz. Oraya gelene kadar son fazlarda öğrendiğiniz hareket şemalarını unutuyorsunuz ve bu da düşmanı kesmenizi daha da zorlaştırıyor. Oyun, Sekiro'dan çok Bloodborne'a benziyor. Hem atmosfer hem de oynanış olarak. Sekiro'dan sonra karakterin o ağırlığı başlarda zulüm gibi geldi açıkçası. O can iksiri içme animasyonu yok mu, mahvetti beni. İçmeden önce kokusuna mı bakıyorsun be adam, kafana dik gitsin şu mereti. Oyunu knight olarak oynadım ama öyle ağır zırh ya da ağır kalkan kullanmadım. Parry tekniğini bir boss savaşı dışında hiç kullanmadım. Oyunun yarısından sonra kalkan kullanmayı tamamen bıraktım. Başlarda buzlu bir kılıç, sonra da bir boss'tan düşürdüğüm buzlu gürzü kullandım ama Dragonslayer Greataxe'ı elde ettikten sonra hiç bırakmadım. O özel ağır ve elektrik veren hasarı hem çoğu boss'ta hem de dünyada gezerken karşıma çıkan ağır zırhlılarda çok işime yaradı. Savaşların normalden az sürmesini sağladı. Soulslike oyunları diğer bütün oyunlardan ayıran en önemli şey zorluğu falan değil, sıradan düşmanlar dahil hepsinin hem görünüş hem de hareket şemasının çok farklı olması. Oyunda sık sık ""Bu şimdi nasıl saldıracak, ne kadar hasar vuracak, ne hasarı verecek, aaa tipi de ilginçmiş"" diyorsunuz. Bunu dedirtebilen oyun sayısı çok çok az. Beni en çok zorlayan boss'lar: Dancer, Twin Princes, Nameless King, Soul of Cinder, Friede ve Gael oldu. Midir'de de zorlandım ama bunlar kadar değil. Müzikler maalesef Bloodborne'dan beri tatmin edici gelmiyor. O bambaşka bir seviyeydi ama bunda akılda kalıcı hiçbir müzik yok. Hikayesi... Bilmiyorum. Keşke şu oyunlara bir de hikaye yazsalar ya da yazdıklarını sunsalar. Kimle neden savaşıyoruz bir de onu bilsek ve onun motivasyonu olsa.",9,2022-06-18,PC,user

piglordofallham,"Yes.. Indeed! Its finally here, the third and final installment (hopefully) in the ""Dark Souls"" duology turned trilogy. Is it everything we hoped for? Probably not, so lets pick this thing apart until theirs nothing left but vague item explanations. I enjoyed the original Demon's Souls as well as Dark Souls back in the day, that ""day"" being 10 years ago and nearly 5 years before its final send-off title. Enjoyment was uneven at best, and downright infuriating making mistakes or miss-timing swings, or repostes, or quite simply vanishing into the floor only to die a few seconds later. I certainly had my share of all of these things in Dark Souls 3, but it is certainly more broken than the original game (even at 60 frames per second). Dark Souls 3 is about as ""finished"" as the original Dark Souls was after Lost Izalith, and many, many, many, many areas can be spotted with unfinished textures, weird black voids, stupid assets blocking off areas or my favorite- paths that seem to lead to absolutely nowhere- because they had to cut off huge chunks of areas. Whole areas are rife with these issues, which is fairly bewildering seeing as this is FromSoft's 5th entree in this particularly series, with about a dozen other King's Field games they apparently didn't ACTUALLY learn anything from while designing. Whether this is because the ""B"" team worked on Dark Souls 3 or not, its incredibly disconcerting. Hitboxes are the worst they've been since Dark Souls 2, enemies have zero artificial intelligence and quite simply rubberband to the player until falling comedically to their death or being outran to the nearest bonfire to reset their positioning. In short, nothing has changed since the original Dark Souls. Enemies are the biggest offense, as they aren't just faster than they've ever been, but bafflingly sometimes emit NO animation tells that they're actually attacking you, or worse are the same attack animations from an older game, but sped up to create some kind of challenge. Weapons? Recycled. Attack animatons for weapons? Recycled. How they manage to create anything new in this series is actually pretty surprising these days. Status ailments are on the menu all throughout, with special mention to those bizarre maggot monsters that instantly glue themselves to the player and cause persisting BLEED damage until you run out of estus, go back to a bonfire, or heal yourself with some red weed that you shove into your face. Random number generation pretty much denies you from being able to just find practical and useful items on enemies you kill, another very dated concept when any speedrunner inevitably realizes none of the enemies are worth wasting your time attacking, so you end up farming for specific items or buying up a handful of items at a time at a shopkeeper. NPC's and their sub-sub-quests (or requests) are just as pointless as they were in the original Dark Souls, but now they all collectively sit around Firelink Shrine, a boring, colorless, grey-black mess of tunnels with no distiguishing features. So have fun wandering down the same boring hallway only to accidentally head back upstairs and miss whatever NPC you didn't know was actually below Andre and the little old lady in the chair. The running theme in Dark Souls 3 appears to be very repetitive and dull level designs that are actually very compact, but difficult to navigate due to their re-used color palette's or textures. FromSoft- just because you rename everything or re-arrange items I've seen a million times, doesn't mean you've made a sequel. If anything Dark Souls 3 is like an expansion pack. Bosses all seem really awful early on, especially the giant tree, who has perplexing and odd hitboxes on his only weakpoints for no discernable reason. I'm tempted to not even call the first few bosses actual ""boss fights"" as they are more like supercharged regular enemies. This is kind of hilarious because the initial mob who turns into a giant black goo snake monster is actually MORE LETHAL than Vordt of the Boreal Valley. It wasn't until I got to the catacombs that I really started to wonder if the game was actually broken. IF you didn't take a big bonk club or something similar with you to the catacombs, then I'm very sorry since now you'll have to deal with extremely tough, fast-moving, unlimited stamina, bleed status effect attacking skeletons that are so agile you might never be able to hit them before they kill you. Of course I'm referring to the ninja skeletons, who are bizarrely dangerous compared to the actual boss in Catacombs of Carthus. Do you see a pattern here? The bosses in Dark Souls 3 are not hard. A lot them go down to fire-applied weapons or lightning imbued weapons, or just a jack hammer of a strength weapon to the side of the skull, and its very satisfying, but what makes Dark Souls 3 actually hard is the broken, terrible, and ridiculous level design and item placement. That's it.",6,2022-05-10,PC,user

It really feels like they perfected the feel of the gameplay. Playing through the game, I felt much more involved in the story than in Dark Souls 1. Either the story is easier to understand, or I've just gotten better over time at interpreting the dark souls lore through the gameplay. I love the bosses in this game, especially the DLCs. Sister Friede was probably my favorite boss fight in the Dark Souls series. I enjoyed them much more than the boss fights in Dark Souls 1, with a few exceptions.

Combined with DLC makes the game challenging but equally interesting.

Wrathzo,"Dark Souls III[a] is a 2016 action role-playing video game developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. Set in the Kingdom of Lothric, a bell has rung to signal that the First Flame, responsible for maintaining the Age of Fire, is dying out. As has happened many times before, the coming of the Age of Dark produces the undead: cursed beings that rise after death. The Age of Fire can be prolonged with the linking of the fire, a ritual in which great lords and heroes sacrifice their souls to rekindle the First Flame. However, Prince Lothric, the chosen linker for this age, abandoned his duty and watched the flame die from afar. The bell is the last hope for the Age of Fire, resurrecting previous Lords of Cinder (heroes who linked the flame in past ages) to attempt to link the fire again; however, all but one Lord shirk their duty. Meanwhile, Sulyvahn, a sorcerer from the Painted World of Ariandel, wrongfully proclaims himself Pontiff and seizes power over Irithyll of the Boreal Valley and the returning Anor Londo cathedral from Dark Souls as a tyrant. It is an action role-playing game played in a third-person perspective. Players have access to various weapons, armour, magic, and consumables that they can use to fight their enemies. Bonfires serve as checkpoints. The Estus Flask is the consumable used for healing in Dark Souls III. Ashen Estus Flasks restore focus points (FP), which can be used for magic or weapon arts.",10,2022-03-22,PC,user
caitsithism,"A game that does everything right. Interesting levels, immense build and class variety, lots of great weapons and armor to deck out the Ashen One, epic boss fights crafted perfectly to tests your skills, glorious sights and stunning views, and an incredibly fascinating yet obtusely portrayed backstory found through subtle hints laid throughout the world, item descriptions, and character designs. The combat of this game is likely the greatest I have ever experienced in a videogame. It is fast paced and exciting, yet still just the right tempo to play methodically and with immense strategy. Overcoming a boss you've been attempting for hours is the greatest feeling of excitement and accomplishment you can receive from a videogame. Truly euphoric at times. The indirect nature of this games story telling in no way takes away from the enjoyment of the game due to the mysterious and cryptic way it presents itself. Going out of your way to learn about the world, its history, its characters, and its motivations only leads to an even greater appreciation for the pure work of art presented to you.",10,2022-03-21,PC,user

Unlike ds2 this game doesn't have its own identity, and build variety ranges from one sword to another, as in sorceries and miracle are there to only benifit the melee build, but the game more than makes up for it by the numerous incredible levels and bosses and it's incredible combat. Just like every other soulsborne game before it, it spoiled me. The feeling of defeating incredible bosses or going through tough areas to find yourself in a short cut back to the bonfire is just **** incredible, the feeling you get after such a task is so full filling, and the lore- the story that the world passively explains and makes you question the validity of linking the fire, to prolong a dying world.

MetalRobot69,"Oh boy, that was the first Souls series game that I've played and I didn't believe it would change my whole gamer view. I never thought I was a player who liked so much difficulty before playing Dark Souls. I always played games on the normal difficulty or maybe in the 2nd higher but Dark Souls you don't have the choice which is a great thing. My first impressions of the game, I was astonished at how good was the combat system. It is indeed a very simple combat system, you don't have many combat moves you can just light, heavy and plunge attack, dodge and defend and parry and use some magic. But the combat system is so polished and accurate you actually feel the weight of your weapon when it collides in the enemy shield and the moves are very precise so when you die you know the mistake was yours alone. The great variety of weapons offsets the lack of combat moves you can characters can do. The exploration and difficulty are both in the same boat. You can die for anything, enemies can come out from a door and kill you by surprise. Enemies on the roof can jump on you and attack you by surprise. You have to be 24/7 alert. And the interesting part is that when you die, you lose your Souls (that are used to level up your character) but if you return to where you died you can retrieve it. That mechanic is so interesting and when you die makes you play safe and strategically to do not lose your souls. The graphics of this game is beautiful (especially Boreal Valley) and each map is unique. Also, the way the game reveals shortcuts as you progress is a masterpiece. So, if the game is so good, why don't you give 10/10? The answer is, I don't like the way the story is told. It isn't for my taste. You play with a character with no story and everything is so philosophical and abstract. Unless you search videos on Youtube, there is a little story in this game and you only can theorize about it. And I am a very story, skewed player. I like games with memorable gameplay mechanics (like Dark Souls) but that also have memorable stories like RDR2, GOW, FC4, etc.",8,2022-02-04,PC,user

WeterGhetto,"ДС3 - хорошая игра, но в ней много изъянов, из-за чего моя оценка 8/10. В игре мне понравилось: - Обновленный дизайн игры по сравнению с прошедшими частями - Офигенные побочные квесты (Сигварда, Леонхарда, Анри) - Возможность проходить игру разными классами: Воином, Лучником, Пиромантом, Магом, Клириком и др. - 3 прикольных босса: Лотрик, Безымянный король и Понтифик - Локация Иритилл холодной долины и пару других Собственно минусы: 1. PVP. Оно просто ужасно и убитое. Возможно в начале игры было прикольно порубить с другими игроками, но в 2022 это просто ппц. Остались либо задроты, либо при вторжении ты попадаешься на стак из 2-3 таких же задров, которые тебя за пару сек уработают. Магами играть вообще нет смысла, так как все заклинания доджатся перекатами, а как у вас кончится мана, то вам конец. 2. Баги. Баги в побочных квестах, когда НПС не появляется. Баги когда метки для призыва НПЦ не появляются. Также в игре куча других багов, про которые я уже подзабыл. 3. Платина. Чтобы ее получить нужно пройти через предыдущие 2 пункта + заниматься геморром по собиранию жестов, колец и другой шляпы. Не вздумайте проходить игру на платину, т.к. Вас будет тошнить и возвращаться в игру будет 0 желания. Странно, но в Бладборне получать платину было прикольно 4. Душные локации. Опять насували духоты по типу подземелья Иритилла, Катакомбы Картуса, болот и других подобных локаций. Неужели нельзя было сделать не душные, а красивые интересные локации по типу Иритилла?! 5. Огромные и легкий боссы. Каждый босс в игре размером в 10 раз больше основного героя. Если пройти игру 1 раз, то на последующие разы босы будут отлетать с 1-2 траев 6. Дисбаланс в оружие. В игры очень много мусорного не юзабельного оружия Лично я считаю, что Бладборн - это пока лучшая игра Фромов, где все минусы перебиваются огромными плюсами. Бладборн - 10/10, ну а ДС3 - 7.5.",8,2022-01-27,PC,user

I do wish the difficulty curve was a bit smother though, the second half of the game is easier than the first and the final boss is a joke. I also have a pet peeve in that the armor wheight limit system feels really limiting. The invading system is broken, sometimes several people invade at once and you have no chance, it is very frustrating as its not fair at all, very stupid.",7,2022-01-16,PC,user

Sepher,"Finally, a game that doesn't handhold and babysit you through the whole experience. We need more games with such difficultly. Or at least with such difficulty options! I like to play games to make myself challenged, and sadly Dark Souls is a rare example to be found in modern gaming. I did not pick it up for a while because it's not really my genre, but am I glad that I eventually got to it. Fantastic experience all around, with some faults that are not a deal breaker. Pros: -Difficulty level is just right, and the AI is quite good without making you feel like it is cheating -Graphics and atmosphere are top-notch -Story seems quite deep and interesting, although I'm not much into this kind of genre -Decent balance in the economy of items/drops, only occasionally felt like there was too much clutter/unneeded resources Cons: -Camera can go out of wack -AI cheats a bit in terms of it being able to swing through solid objects and walls, the kind of objects whereas a player's sword would fail to do the same (annoyingly getting the blocked animation)",9,2021-11-20,PC,user

srinu634,"If I played this in 2016, probably this would have been rated a 10. However, after playing Demon's souls on PS5 and Sekiro. I have to give a rating of 8 for Dark souls 3. Pro's: - Super fast combat that brings adrenaline rush. The combat difficulty for bosses sits below Sekiro. - Weapon variety is amazing. Love the fact that you can also create the boss weapons for yourself. - The bosses are amazing. Ex: Lothric, Abyss watchers and Pontiff are truly amazing bosses. - Has amazing shortcuts, hidden Easter eggs, NPC's lore is pretty good - Magic/Pyro/Miracle system works pretty well and doesn't make the game monotonous - Replayability of DS3 is amazing. Cons: - One of my biggest problem with this game is the inferior level design compared to Demon's souls. You can literally run to most of the bosses. Compare that to Demon's souls where you have to earn your way. It's understandable that Demon's souls has easier bosses so it makes sense that level difficulty is higher. However, level designs feel far inferior to Demon's souls. Boleterian palace, Swamp of Sorrow, Stonefang tunnel feel far more superior to any level design in Dark Souls 3. The Only place I can think in DS3 is the Irithyll valley but it's still subpar with Demon's souls level design. PS: pls ignore the typos. I'm too lazy now.",9,2021-10-29,PC,user

andrey809736428,"Это просто великолепная игра. Одна из лучших игр, в которые я играл, если точнее. Да что уж там, это превая игра которую я с удовольствием прошёл больше одного раза, 4 если точнее, и каджое прохождение приносило огромное количество удовольствия. Эта игра - чисто про геймплей, и он тут выверен и вылизан до состояния близкого к идеальному. Игра в меру сложная, но всегда даёт шанс на победу, каким бы билдом ты не играл. Игра не считает игрока идиотом, и не боится подкидывать сюрпризы, в том числе и на соображалку. Левел и арт дизайн просто изумительны: можно спокойно ориенироваться без карты, даже при первом прохождении, у каждой локации есть свой неповторимый стиль, ты никогда не спутаешь ещё с другой, и общая атмосфера - нечто неверотяное. Музыкальное сопровождение игры... достаточно будет сказать что я до сих пор слушаю некоторые темы боссов, а тема из главного меню - вообще шедевр. Враги всегда умеют чем то удивить, да и просто разглядывать их - безумно увлекательно. Короче, эта игры - квинтэссенция всего хорошего что было в SoulsBorn серии, и я искренне рад что мне удалось пощупать этот шедевр",10,2021-10-17,PC,user

Bheg,"So when I was younger I tried DK1 and 2, and couldn't pass through stage 3 or so. It was way too frustrating for me. Now as an adult I tried DK3 and man, I'm so happy I've grown enough to give it chance! The amazin atmosphere, the superbly designed levels with their endless secrets, the most epic boss fights of any game I've played before, the infinite variety of builds, the non stop tension of being at the verge of death like a survival horror, the joy while beating a level (or finding a campfire), the coop and pvp! Everything is just great. The game can be frustrating to new players, but mostly because they will approach the game with past games mindset that dying is somehow a sign that you are a clumsy player. No. If you haven't been living under a rock you should know that in this game you will die like a hundred times no matter how good **** you think you are. So expect that! Now I will give it a 9 out of 10 because graphics could be better, sometimes gameplay can be a little clunky or glitchy and get you killed (which is not fun if this is like the 10th time you are trying to kill a boss), and personaly, I felt some areas near the end of the game were too long and so they felt tedious, considering they were no longer a novelty since you had already seen similar things in previous levels. Also the endings were a bit lackluster, even though it should be expected since the game never really elaborates too much on the story elements, but still after such a nightmare, a longer and more developed ending would have been fun. Btw tip to new players, keep those vit and vigor stats high or you'll be sorry.......... That's all, I'm going to start the remastered now... Hype!",9,2021-08-31,PC,user

heterospaghetti,"Я вообще редко, когда играю, начинаю яро ненавидеть разработчика игры, потому что считаю, что в постоянном проигрыше виновен непосредственно сам игрок, но с этой игрой все с точностью наоборот, с каждой минутой геймплея, каждая клеточка моего тела, желала ""всего наилучшего"" разработчикам данной игры. Основные претензии касаются только механики игры, она здесь поломана, это касается невероятно кривой камеры, даже без ее таргетлока она исполняет брейк данс возле врага. Бекстабы-репосты, сделаны невероятно криво и работают через раз, и то не факт, даже стоя вплотную к врагу это редко когда получается. Очень легко выпасть за текстуры, в некоторых местах достаточно прижаться к стенке и ты тут же окунаешься в дайвинг под картой. Стан, особо шустрые противники могут без особых проблем застанить игрока, самый яркий пример - это рыцари в замке лотрика и танцовщица ( я раз 100 хотел дропнуть изза нее игру). Хитбоксы, максимально кривые, особенно ""радуют"" при грабах. Про прохождение атак врагов сквозь текстуры я даже и расписывать не хочу. Но стоит выделить и такие вещи как: Архитектура: просто 12/10, невероятно красивые здания готической архитектуры; Графен: Он шикарен, особенно туманные локации или небольшая дымка, также стоит выделить детализацию врагов; Сюжет: Эдакая ""игра престолов"", но как по мне, слишком запутанный в 3 части. Персонажи: очень прописанные, если зайти на ""дарквики"" то можно узнать чуть ли не их полную биографию Учитывая все минусы, данная серия является моей любимой, третья часть же не стала исключением. Сколько бы я не умирал, мне хотелось играть в нее снова и снова. Так как игра ставит перед игроком некое испытание, и когда ты его проходишь то тебя настигает шквал эмоций.",7,2021-06-05,PC,user

kalikinalex,"Дырка соски 3 или как нам продают одну и ту же игру в 4 раз Знаете, игровая индустрия меняется: - появляются новые технологии, новые механики; - изменяется жанр в серии какой-нибудь игры, например postal был изометрическим шутером, а стал шутером от 1 лица с открытым миром, с черным юмором и т.д. Разработчики учитывают ошибки с прошлых частей серии, как было например с zombie army. НО ВСЁ ЭТО НЕ ОТНОСИТСЯ К DARK SOULS III, а спросите почему? Всё тот же геймплей с минимум изменений. Враги всё также умирают статично, а когда падают, у них включается рэгдолл. Боссы и мобы всё также ударяют сквозь стены и столбы. Всё такое же лаганое пвп, когда ударяешь врага, слышится даже звук, что ты его ударил, но урон cyka не засчитался. Некоторые летающие твари также вылетают за карту и умирают там(хотя это маленький плюс). Всё те же подсказки с кнопками от xbox, а не от клавиатуры. В игре нет steam cloud судя по отзывам. Представляете в игре нет steam cloud, так и еще нет иконок кнопок для клавиатуры. А самое главное - эти узкоглазые твари-унтерменши продают этот вонючий кaл за 2000 РУБЛЕЙ!!! Из нового только то, что некоторые мобы дерутся друг с другом, у всех боссов появляется 2 стадия, а самое главное - кровь наконец-то остается на земле, а то в прошлых частях этого даже не было!!! Также хочется сказать про пвп и античит. Почему Я обычный игрок должен дополнительно устанавливать пользовательский античит, так как в игре уже есть античит, но хреновый. Почему я должен надеяться, что ко мне не зайдет конченный опущенный пидopac с читами и не наспамит мне с другом в инвентарь мечей Повелителей бурь +20, которые нельзя удалить. Почему в игре нельзя отключить пвп, чтобы нормально пройти с другом игру, без присоединяющихся к нам красных yeбkoв. Подведем итог: DARK SOULS III - игра в которой ничего кардинально не изменилось и ничего нового не добавилось. DARK SOULS III - это слитые 509 рублей в унитаз за делюкс версию. DARK SOULS III - это игра, с которой не нужно брать пример другим разработчикам. DARK SOULS III - это когда ты рад, что наконец-то удалил со своего ПК эту пapaшу. DARK SOULS III - это мусор, который не стоит вашего внимания. Спасибо за внимание, я думаю вы это учтете.",1,2021-05-17,PC,user

samstrummer90,"Gráficos, jugabilidad, música e historia. Este juego lo tiene todo. No se puede juzgar si es mejor o peor que DS1 desde la objetividad pero a mi, personalmente y subjetivamente, me parece mejor que la primera entrega. El juego no es complicado, es cierto que durante nuestra primera partida (y más si nunca hemos jugado a juegos así) vamos a morir bastante y a frustrarnos en ciertos momentos pero el juego nunca deja de enseñarnos lecciones ni deja de ser entretenido. La dificultad en este juego es una cosa muy subjetiva, cada uno elige como de difícil quiere que sea su experiencia en Dark Souls 3. Lo primero que debemos hacer es entender como funciona el juego y que reglas debemos seguir en su universo. Aprender a utilizar correctamente las stats, armas, anillos y los tipos de ataque así como entender como funciona el daño causado es algo obligatorio si queremos disfrutar de este juego y superarlo. No hay nada más satisfactorio que ir poco a poco aprendiendo a jugar, entender el juego y ver como cosas que antes nos parecían imposibles, con la práctica y el tiempo se convierten en sencillas y triviales. También es muy importante saber que tipo de jugador somos y que forma de jugar se nos da mejor. En mi primera partida elegí un caballero con espada y lo pasé francamente mal (no se me da bien jugar con personajes de cuerpo a cuerpo) pero cuando cambié a un piromántico la cosa cambió por completo. Eso de rodar ligero de equipo y lanzar bolas de fuego era lo mío y enemigos que antes me parecían imposibles se tornaron en un paseo, aunque eso no significa que todo consista en rodar y lanzar fuego, pues también encontré enemigos que con mi caballero me parecían super sencillos mientras que con el piromántico lo pase bastante peor. Hay un mantra en torno a este juego llamado ""git gud"" utilizado de manera despectiva contra la gente que se queja de su dificultad, sin embargo, es cierto. No es el sentido de que debamos tener reflejos felinos y recordar de manera precisa cada ataque de un enemigo sino en el sentido de que debemos aprender como funciona el juego, aprender todo lo que nos ofrece y utilizar correctamente todas las herramientas del juego. Esa es la verdadera dificultad de Dark Souls pero una vez que aprendemos (consiste en leer durante 10 minutos un par de foros) el juego se vuelve muy divertido, entretenido y asequible. Es cierto que algunos enemigos tienen energía infinita, causan enorme daño y tienen rangos de ataque absurdos pero no hay nada que no se pueda derrotar con la estrategia (y digo estrategia, no habilidad) correcta. Respecto al online hay también bastante controversia. Mi primera partida fue offline, sin invasiones: ni aliados ni enemigos mas allá de los NPC. Creo que es como se debería hacer la primera partida a cualquier dark souls. Mi segunda partida volvió a ser offline pero utilizando una guía (hay tantos secretos en este juego que se hace verdaderamente difícil completar las misiones secundarias y encontrar las zonas opcionales sin ayuda) y en mi NG++ offline fue cuando por fin me convertí en ""maestro"" de este juego. Al terminarlo salte de lleno al online. El modo online es necesario si queremos aumentar nuestro nivel de juramentos y conseguir los objetos asociados a ese juramento. Hay varias opciones tanto para PVP como para cooperativo así como varias opciones para aumentar o reducir las probabilidades de ser invadidos. Hay gente que se queja de que no puede jugar cooperativo con sus amigos sin ser invadidos, pero es una forma de equilibrar el juego. DS se torna ridículamente fácil si jugamos con un amigo, Incluso los NPC con su IA limitada hacen de este juego un paseo, imaginaos jugando con un humano de verdad. Por eso existen los fantasmas rojos y las invasiones hostiles, para compensar la dificultad. Es un tema subjetivo y relativo a los gustos de cada persona como deberían o no ser las invasiones pero son como son y hay que adaptarse a ello en lugar de llorar y quejarse. Si no quieres invasiones, juega offline; si quieres pocas invasiones, juega SOLO y si quieres un PVP constante usa un dedo reseco pero no te quejes de que eres invadido constantemente cuando juegas con tus amigos en co-op porque esa es la forma en que esta concebido este juego. En resumen, Dark Souls 3 es una obra maestra que permite a cada jugador crear su propia experiencia de juego a la vez que ofrece unos gráficos, música y jugabilidad de sobresaliente. PD: Para el jugador medio, no para los pros (y esto es una opinión totalmente subjetiva), el juego es más justo que Bloodborne pero menos que Sekiro a nivel de ""Fair Play"" de los enemigos contra el jugador y es un juego más difícil que DS1. Aunque la dificultad en estos juegos es una experiencia única para cada jugador.

TheTownDrunk,"DARK SOULS III is just another DARK SOULS game, more of the same. Sure, it's the best looking DARK SOULS game, but that can be expected as it is the newest one. Firstly, the controls with a mouse & keyboard are terrible. Not DS 1 terrible, but close. The devs still haven't learned how to make a proper PC port: button prompts still show the controller buttons and some keys don't work at all. The gameplay is repetitive. Yes, so is every ""souls"" game out there, but it's a difference if you're playing your very first game of this type or X Souls XX. The combat really isn't good either: unrealistic (knights in full plate armor rolling? C'mon man!). You just follow a pattern: dodge-roll, dodge-roll, run in, hit, hit, dodge-roll, dodge-roll, run in, hit, hit, rinse and repeat. Any enemy can kill you in 2-3 hits, you'll run into boss enemies (which are the core of the game) which have a huge health pool with battles lasting for several minutes (think bullet sponges in shooter games). What I do like about this series is the storytelling and lack of a clear narrative: you get fragments here and there from reading item descriptions and using your imagination and there is room for interpretation. I LOVE that! It's there if you want it, but if you're not interested - for whatever reason - you can just ignore it. There are very few cut scenes, which is good. I liked BLOODBORNE and LORDS OF THE FALLEN, the latter being a little more forgiving if you're not one of the arrogant ""Git gud"" crowd. DARK SOULS III is not as bad as DARK SOULS II but it isn't as good as the first one either. AVERAGE.",5,2021-01-21,PC,user
Alegotron,"It gets a 8 from me, because overall the game is a masterpiece.. but it borrows so much from Dark Souls 1 that sometimes, I get the two mixed up, and I found the Grand Archives to be EXTREMELY annoying. If Grand Archives, one of the later levels in the game, wasn't so hellbent in blasting the player with dozens of projectiles at any given moment and a crystal sage that teleports out of reach throughout a 3 story interior, I'd give it a 9. The bulk of DS3 is challenging but fair combat against your usual fromsoft enemies, in reasonable numbers. Fast aggressive enemies mixed in with slower, lumbering types, designed to trip up your dodge timing and make you dodge into an enemy. Often, there'll be a few archers situated behind you or across the map segment you are fighting in, making you weave through enemies to take it/them down first. There's a healthy dose of firebomb throwers and enemies with surprise mutation mechanics, as well as the typical hide behind a wall until you walk by kind of enemies that would make a COD player scream ""Camper!!"" into their mic. Dogs and other fast monster enemies are spread throughout, but don't make the bulk of the game. It's not until later levels that annoying enemies and the number of them begin to increase, although there appears to be late game enemies mixed in low area levels, like the giant crabs of Farron Keep. I'd recommend if there's a certain mob or enemy type that you can't kill no matter how hard you try, just run past them. Bosses in my opinion are much easier and way more predictable than some of the bigger mobs that appear in inconvenient locations through the game. Level design is pretty good, typical linear but labyrinthine approach that Fromsoft is known for, but I think some enemy placements could be better. The bosses overall are pretty good, definitely better than the ones in Dark Souls 2 and the difficulty seems to ease the player in a little more smoothly than Bloodborne or Dark Souls 1. When Dark Souls 3 decides to become hard, it's just as hard as the others, if not harder, but I found the beginning for the most part to be much easier to breeze through than the others. The beginning will no doubt be hard to easy mode casuals and newcomers, but it's better off to start out difficult then start out piss easy and throw a difficulty spike out of nowhere. The graphics are nice, and coming from the PS4 version, the PC upgrade is instantly noticeable. On an RX580 I can run ultra at 1080 and get 60 frames locked, the visuals aren't that much better that I noticed but the framerate is night and day. Particle effects like ice shimmer or fires flickering look really nice, and reflections on armor and weapons are suitably eye candy. Locations all have some visual flair and overall, the graphics are pretty good and aren't likely to distract with low res textures or enemy T-poses. The weapons and armor all look nice, but although there are a bunch of weapons in DS3, many are recycled from the first game and none of them felt as fun to use as the trick weapons in Bloodborne. Regardless they serve their purpose and there's a good amount of build variety. It's a great game, but if you're new to Fromsoft games, I'd recommend playing the first game before. I think it has the most balanced difficulty between NPC summons, weapons, combat timing and overall enjoyment. But since most people won't understand the overall story anyway, DS3 isn't a bad place to start either.",8,2021-01-19,PC,user
wokenoodle,"This is certainly the best Dark Souls have ever looked and felt to play. The visuals got richer and you no longer need to fill some occasional blanks - like an empty wall or repetitive corridors - with your imagination, almost everything you look at is now realistically busy and detailed, with no detriment to the distinct style. Most animations feel refined to a millisecond, with more confident, faster pace than in previous games, while a lot of quality of live improvements have been made to smooth the experience out. That said, I found other crucial parts to be somewhat lacking: the sound, level design, story and overall gameplay, while not being bad in any way, beg for some innovation and progress. At it's third entry Dark Souls sometimes feels vexingly familiar - which is not a feeling I've come to expect of it. As a conclusion to a trilogy with all the best parts of the game series I love realised close to perfection, Dark Souls III was a satisfying experience, but it will remain overshadowed by what has been or what's to come.",8,2021-01-08,PC,user

R3DTHR3AT,"Сразу ощущается, что была сделана работа над ошибками второй части и игра во многом вернулась к канонам первой части. + стилистика снова стала ближе к жанру дарк фентези. + дизайн уровней близок к первой части, чем к позорным кишкам-коридорам из второй. + годная итемизация. Остались 4 слота для колец из второй части, но общее количество колец возросло кратно, что открывает простор для билдостроения + снова вернулись сложные боссы + мотивированное пвп с фармом итемов ковенантов за которые дают кольца, оружия, заклинания. Игра до сих пор с хорошим онлайном. Каких-то серьезных минусов выделить не могу. Сначала не понравилась возможность тупо пробегать мобов от костра до костра, но с другой стороны для прохождения нг+ и нг++ эта возможность обернулась плюсом. Возможно минусом является чрезмерное копирование мотивов первой части, с одной стороны вроде как отсылки для фанатов, а с другой кажется, что их черезчур много и попахивает халтурой и ленью разрабов придумать что-то новое. Косвенным минусом являются некоторые игроки, которые играют в эту игру. В частности те, кто проходят ее троем. Вторгаешься как обычно и тут сразу на тебя бросается сразу трое умственно отсталых. В чем прикол фейсроллить все локи как трактор и убивать боссов за 10сек? И ведь это действительно не случайная компашка. Чекаешь их стим профили - все трое из Финляндии/Турции/Китая.

TOKYO_GHOUL_R,"Серия соулс в свое время произвела фурор на рынке видеоигр, ибо трудно представить, чтобы игра в которой вас насилуют по несколько сотен раз за прохождение, понравилась такому большому количеству человек, но чудеса случаются. Начинал свое знакомство с этой серией именно с 3 части, ибо до 2017 года не имел нужного железа, да и вообще не знал что это такое, эти темные души и с чем их едят. После сотен часов боли и прохождения двух других частей абсолютно честно признаюсь, что эта часть самая слабая из всех лично для меня, но не лишенная той же изюминки, что первые 2 игры. Дарк соулс 3 ощущается гораздо более быстрым проектом, нежели первый или второй соулс из-за чего мне было попроще играть в первые 2 части, а другим наоборот, ибо 1 и 2 дс по скорости одинаковы. Проект японцев все также не прощает ошибок, имеет потрясающие локации и свой шарм, но до уровня первых частей явно не дотягивает. Отдельным бонусом всех игр соулс является кооператив, в котором можно весело гаситься против боссов и вражеских фантомов. Единственное что не советую это пвп из-за разницы в пинге и обилия читеров.

HalvingHumanity,"I think the biggest reason for negative reviews is people accrediting the difficulty to nothing other than ""difficult for difficulties sake"". And while obviously the people who learn and love to learn the complex battle maneuvers that are required to take down the most difficult enemies will disagree on that reason alone. I must say that this game is polarizing because of how subjectively meaningful it is and the effect it has on the gamer at hand personally. I have long battled w/ depression, anxiety, agoraphobia and near-death addiction (worst of all). These are fights that require 100x the effort I once put into something as simple as survival, and 1000x the effort to achieve happiness. Unlike a game, I am forced to grapple with these or lose my life at worst or suffer tremendous physical and psychological pain at best if I ignore this necessary fight. Someone once talked in detail about how to them overcoming Dark Souls 1 and overcoming their depression were a synonymous time in their life. And that ideology instantly clicked as a perfect description of one of my primal loves for Miyazaki's games. Just as it is not as easy as your typical game to succeed in, in life it is not as simple for someone to be healthy and happy for a man/woman suffering through mental illness, addiction, grief, physical illness or any of many human hardships, compared to the the relatively easily happy and healthy lives of people not facing any major hardship. People unhindered by such hardships are able to feel freedom in life without much struggle nor the relatively huge uphill battle that other people must climb just to reach the same level ground as people who had a shorter and less treachorous walk to the same place in life. For us people who are FORCED to live with hardship and fight make our own wellness and happiness, lest we give up and suffer and/or die for it; the mechanics of this game offer much needed catharsis. Every day I am reminded of the people I loved who died in their early youth from addiction. Every day I struggle with the distorted lens through which the average person stigmatizes me, alienates me, revokes opportunity from me, and propagates their many unfounded, preconceived notions of me. I have been sober for 4 years, yet even after 40 years sober, I will have my talents, skills, education, positivity, and love that I have to offer minimized, denied and rejected all because I made a mistake when I was young because a near death injury left me with chronic pain and lack of proper medical pain treatment led me to opiates. A lack of proper education left me with no knowledge of what physical addiction and withdrawals were until I was too far into it and began experiencing unbearable pain when forgoing opiates for just a few hours. I was no longer self-treating my injury-related pain, I was in a vicious cycle of staving off opiate withdrawals with enough opiates to simply feel normal. I was not pursuing a high, I could no longer even pursue pain-relief for my past of chronic pain, I was simply being thrown through the endlessly vicious loop of dosing myself and separating my doses far enough apart to avoid withdrawals and feel like a normal person again. The reason I mention this is because in Dark Souls (DS3 in this case), we bare the Darksign which is the source of eternal hardship for all undead who bare this mark. Its simply a symbol on our character's body, yet it causes our character to be alienated and cast out of society, it causes our character to be judged before even met. We are the victim of great and unwarranted stigma and hate. Its very familiar. And in the end, we fight for something greater for the whole world; to bring a new age for the better of all mankind, even if said mankind had treated us as the filthiest subhuman trash in existence, not for our actions, not for our character, but for our undead status. Getting sober was a hellish fight, eternally more difficult than any endeavor I faced prior to age 23 when I first touched opiates. It was a fight to make a better life for the benefit of myself, my loved ones and society at large. Yet I was looked down upon all the same. Despite such unjust condemnation, I did not let it hold me back in my quest to do what is objectively right in this world. I may have started as a hollow of myself, but I seeked out the light and was rewarded with mercy and reward in life and from those loved ones I truly care for. I set out in a Souls Game, vicariously ready to relive my fight against hardship through the player character. A character so similar in circumstance to myself. The great failures and more permanent losses are like my life, and learning to cope with tremendous, irrevocable pain and loss, it had all the more meaning. Success in DS is earned and far more emphatic/meaningful, just as a life success in the face of death+hardship is. Can't recommend enough. Improved perfectly on prior games.

NitroxX,Una vez habiendo completado la historia principal del Dark Souls III dejandome un par de jefes opcionales tengo que decir que estoy muy contento con la experiencia que he tenido con esta tercera entrega de la saga Dark Souls. Contando con que es el primer 'Souls' que he logrado pasarme tengo que decir que es un videojuego de una gran calidad. A su vez con todas esas mecánicas y características que hacen especial a la saga este Souls además cuenta con una gran dificultad que obliga al jugador a estar en constante concentración. Aparte también destaca por una interesante y fascinante historia que hace que te sumerjas en la narrativa y pongas mas desempeño en intentar estar a la altura de las diferentes situaciones que te plantea el videojuego. En resumen me parece una muy buena primera experiencia con esta saga lo cual me va a animar a probar tambien los demas lanzamientos de Miyazaki. Muy recomendado.

Я не буду отдельно говорить про мультиплеер, т.к. по большей степени это соло-игра, но раз он есть, то почему бы не сделать его нормальным. Ну а баги есть в каждой игре, просто в дарк соулсе они сильно подбешивают. В целом, это шедевр в мире РПГ, я не знаю игры более подходящей, чем Дарк Соулс в этом жанре.

nitorita,"A revisiting of the OG action RPG gameplay that FromSoftware pioneered in the first game that does not fail to do the series justice and even surpasses it in some ways. Weapons once again have plenty lot of variety, and there are tons of unique regions to explore with plenty of bosses to fight. The UI has been optimized to give more convenient access to every function. PvP is once again the same old invasion system that made the original game great (although the ability to disable forced invasions is questionable as it takes some of the Dark Souls identity out of the game). There isn't much to say about this sequel as it is essentially more Dark Souls for fans who couldn't get enough of the first. Ranged is once again underwhelming, which is a personal peeve, and there is cheese potential with some bosses (of which are overall harder than they used to be). But the beautiful graphics and picturesque world make up for these shortfalls. The final boss fight was definitely the most challenging but also the most satisfying, as you genuinely needed to learn and memorize the boss's moves in order to defeat them. Their defeat simply makes you crave more to play. I will definitely be looking forward to further sequels, or Bloodborne, if I can get my hands on it.

Hexen-Slayer,"The final entry in the DARK SOULS series is out of ideas. It's not the train wreck that the horrible second installment was, but it's not really good either. There are notable improvements over the sequel in the enemy design - no more fighting 4 similar bosses, this has been somewhat reduced. The ridiculous amount of bosses has also been drastically reduced, which is much better (DS 2 obviously ran out of ideas, so they just copy-pasted a few bosses in each corner). Bosses now have 3 ""stages"" and change their patterns in each stage - this was carried over from BLOODBORNE.. I can't say I'm a fan of this, but I can see why die hard DS fans might applaud this. You will be revisiting Lordran and some areas of DARK SOULS 1, you will also fight a few old enemies. Whether this is good or bad you will have to decide for yourself. The complex level design of DARK SOULS 1 and its originality aren't here, but it is a step up from part 2 nonetheless. Die hard fans of SOULS games will probably love this entry, I did love the original DARK SOULS and my favorite out of these ""type"" of games is BLOODBORNE, but I wouldn't consider myself a fan of the ""SOULS-genre"". If that applies to you as well, you might want to pass this one. Something worth noting: the mouse + keyboard controls are still terrible, so don't even try playing this without a controller! Visually this is of course the most impressive entry in the series with some just marvelous vistas to behold. The art style is just gorgeous.

Actually I have played this game in PS4 before, at that time I wasn't impressed much since I compared it with Bloodborne but now again on PC 60 FPS with all dlcs I think this game are all-around well made and deserves very high score. Anyway, the game does locked at 60 FPS, which is a shame for high end PC users. NG+ does not offer something different as I have expected. Graphic in my opinion is just ok.

Dark Souls III is a return to form, coming close to meeting the high bar set by the first game in the series. The feel and timing of combat is closer to the first souls than the second. All the things we loved about the series are present here, bleak settings, a story filled with mystery, timing focused combat.

Smile_Bot,"Dark Souls 3 is masterfully made, from the visual design, Amazing solemn yet tense music, to the all the tiny game play nuances everything is put together in a great package that will challenge you to the limit. After beating the game I feel like their is still so much for me to go back and do, from tiny side bosses to entire character story lines I haven't explored, the game has so much replay value it shows why From Software is praised for how much content they have put into so many of these projects. The world it's self seems to be always in a state of decay even though greenery is nearly always present, making the world's atmosphere feel more thought out and storied then simply everything being dead. The game play is weighty and fun, making bosses tense and even small encounters still require your attention, even at high levels I found that beginning areas could get me low on health if I wasn't careful. Then, the music, the best part of this game bar none, the cacophony of both beautiful melodies and tense weaving courses make this game a joy to listen to, which makes the quite moments where you can hear distant creatures and your own steps even more tense. The game does suffer from some bugs I encountered, from going through the floor of a lift, to having NPCs simply stand and watch me because they don't know how to walk up steps directly to the left of them. Dumb deaths (Like phasing through the floor) can be frustrating when you can lose all of your Souls (XP/Currency) that way. Other then those grievances I had no other problems. Overall the game is worth playing, I enjoyed the game immensely and is a solid 9/10 Fun Challenge I did on my first play through Every time you die, do 10 Jumping jacks, when you die with humanity restored do 15, when you die as a Summon do 20. I wouldn't recommend it, but I thought it was a fun little side thing, so I thought I might as well put it in, if you want to try it yourself.",9,2020-06-23,PC,user

JonsGone,"Probably the ""worst"" game in the Dark Souls series but still an amazing game and a must play. If i had to reccomend any DS game, it would be DS3. Gameplay fluidity massively improved. Boss variation is severely lacking, but somewhat improved by DLCs. Guy in armor, guy in armor, guy in armor, girl in armor, guy in armor. PvP is the worst thing ever, only then to appear how it should always have been in DLC1. Embering is the same thing as hollowing but noone **** about that . Weapon roster is a treasure trove. Magic is somewhat of a joke. Less obtuse than DS1/2 since it is more linear but still requires outside help to figure out questlines. DS1 > DS2 > DS3",10,2020-05-04,PC,user

banzar,"Dark Souls 3 bildet als letzter Teil der Souls-Trilogie den krönenden Abschluss der berüchtigten RPG-Reihe von From Software. Als mit dem Untod verfluchter ""Unentfachter"" kämpft man sich durch eine erbarmungslose Fantasy-Welt in der an jeder Ecke der Tod lauert. Dabei droht stets der Verlust der gesammelten Seelen. Highlights sind die epischen Bosskämpfe, die anspruchsvoll aber fair sind, sodass sich jeder Sieg wie ein Triumph anfühlt. Das Gameplay wird nur selten durch die Erzählung unterbrochen - stattdessen kann man die Lore des Spiels den Beschreibungen von Gegenständen, kurzen Dialogen mit NPCs, oder der Gestaltung der Welt entnehmen. Diese Fragmente ergeben mit der Zeit eine immer deutlichere Ahnung von der Welt von Dark Souls und dem Sinn der eigenen Bemühungen, die allerdings immer etwas kryptisch und interpretativ bleiben. Durch viele optionale Inhalte und verschiedene Spezialisierungen vom Ritter bis zum Zauberer hat das Spiel einen hohen Wiederspielwert. Dark Souls 3 schafft es ein einzigartiges Spielgefühl zu erschaffen, und verpackt es diesmal so elegant und visuell ansprechend wie keiner seiner Vorgänger. Insgesamt ist es ein anspruchsvolles Action-RPG das Hartnäckigkeit mit Genugtuung belohnt, und anstatt ihn an die Hand zu nehmen, den Spieler auch mal geradewegs in den Abgrund rennen lässt.",9,2020-02-24,PC,user

In other words, Jolly cooperation! + DLCs are amazing. Ashes of Ariandel was short but makes the dlc well worth your money. The Ringed City was fantastic. + Voice acting is on point. + Not everyone likes this but I love how storytelling works in this game. - You will have to back up your save data every now and then because: 1. No cloud saves. 2. Hackers/cheaters can get your account banned if you don't know how to avoid them. (I don't think you have to worry much about hackers as long as you back up your save data and don't pick any of the items they drop for you. Also alt+f4 and replace your save data with your back up file if you ever encounter one. I have only encountered one hacker throughout my 100h+ playtime so you really don't need to worry much about it.) - I miss how the areas were connected with each other in Dark Souls 1. - Poor anti-aliasing.

vxnxcxvs,"TL;DR: Fan service. For many years, I thought that Dark Souls II was the worst game of the triology. But after play Dark Souls III, I changed my mind. The game is very beautiful, have good bosses and the level design is awesome. But there's too many fan service to cover some mistakes. The weapon art is ridiculous. While in Dark Souls II you have a good Power Stance, in Dark Souls III every sword looks like an acrobatic pole. Seriously, just press one button and your character do three backflips, one twist and finish doing burpees. The optimization is also bad in consoles, I noticed that when I reached some areas and I thought I was playing Dark Souls I and trying to rush in Blighttown. And the farming is very broken too. I spent almost 20h farming covenant items (and i didn't complete the farm!), and I was using all discovery boosts avaiable in the game.

DiabloNero,"WOW quel tour de force de la part de From Software, qui a été capable de créer et d'imposer une série à contre-courant du marché actuel avec la saga des Souls. Plus impressionnant encore, ils ont réussi à sortir un nouveau jeu du même acabit tous les ans, pendant trois années consécutives. Mais à force de tirer sur la corde, ne fini-t-elle pas par céder ? Dark Souls 3 démarre comme ses prédécesseurs, en nous en mettant plein la vue grâce à une scène d'introduction en image de synthèse sublime mais cryptique. On comprend que beaucoup de temps a passé entre le premier épisode et celui-ci et que la puissance du Premier Feu, source de toute vie, se met à faiblir une fois de plus. Mais contrairement à Gwyn qui a tout donné, jusqu'à son âme, pour préserver le Feu, les Seigneurs des Cendres actuels refusent de se sacrifier pour la flamme. Comme dans une ultime malédiction ou tentative désespérée de sauver le monde, une armée de soldats morts au combat, incapables en leur temps de devenir des seigneurs, sort de leurs cercueils et marche à nouveau sur la terre. Ces soldats ressuscités, qu'on appelle les Morteflammes, ne sont animés que d'une seule ambition : voler les âmes des Seigneurs des Cendres afin de raviver le Premier Feu. On incarne alors une de ces MorteFlammes à qui l'on offre une nouvelle chance de sauver le monde. Bien entendu, l'histoire et l'univers de Dark Souls 3 sont bien plus riches que ne le laissent à penser ces quelques lignes, mais c'est plus quelque chose que l'on ressent en parcourant les ruines de l'empire déchu de Lothric que quelque chose que l'on peut réellement expliquer ou coucher sur du papier. De la même manière que l'on ressent la puissance symbolique et historique d'une cathédrale tri-centenaire à Lisbonne, tous les lieux que l'on traverse au long de l'aventure transpirent un héritage culturel qui nous échappe, mais qui contribue énormément à l'ambiance globale. Ces sentiments naissent grâce à l'excellent travail de From Software sur l'architecture de chacun des bâtiments. Les inspirations baroques et gothiques font effet et, même si Dark Souls 3 est loin de tirer le meilleur de la nouvelle génération de console, on note une très nette amélioration dans la modélisation et la finesse des textures. On regrettera cependant que la diversité ne soit pas réellement au rendez-vous puisque l'on passe d'une muraille à un château à une cathédrale, à un palais, le tout entre-coupé de ces (visiblement) indispensables cavernes et autres tombeaux. Même la vallée boréale, qui flatte la rétine de manière inattendue, n'est finalement pas si originale par rapport au tout premier épisode de Dark Souls qui nous proposait de visiter le monde peint d'Ariamis. Plus regrettable encore, le monde de Dark Souls 3 est terriblement linéaire. Ce qui faisait la grande force du premier épisode du premier Dark Souls, c'est son level design où toutes les zones se retrouvaient connectés les unes aux autres. Cela faisait naître un sentiment de perdition étonnant chez le joueur tout en ajoutant une cohérence incroyable à ce monde. Petit à petit, le joueur apprenait et comprenait son monde, il se l'appropriait. Dark Souls 2 avait quant à lui une structure en étoile assez décriée où le hub central du jeu permettait de partir sur quatre sentiers distincts et non-reliés, comme si l'on pouvait choisir son niveau. Dans Dark Souls 3, c'est la ligne droite. Il est quasiment impossible de bifurquer ou de se perdre et quand bien même on reviendrait en arrière, des portes qui ne s'ouvrent que d'un côté sont là pour vous remettre dans le droit chemin. La difficulté du titre s'en ressent alors directement et tout plaisir d'exploration ou de découverte est alors grandement atténué. On avait également pour habitude de devoir dénicher les passages dérobés et activer des mécanismes en tout genre pour rejoindre l'un des rares Feux de Camp (checkpoint du jeu), mais ça n'est plus du tout le cas désormais. Le nombre de Feux a d'ailleurs été très largement revu à la hausse, si bien que cela entraîne certaines situations curieuses où deux feux se trouvent littéralement à 20 pas les uns des autres. Un aveu de faiblesse dans le level design, à moins que ça ne soit qu'un nouveau présage de la difficulté en baisse dans cet épisode.",10,2019-09-13,PC,user

fordagame,"Game is beautiful. DONT BE AFRAID that game is HARD. It is not that hard. If you are fan of RPGs, souls like games always provide very interesting gameplay. if you are fan of fighting with classic warrior or mages. Leveling is interesting. A lot of different kind of weapons and skills. It is easier than Bloodborne in my opinion. Lets separate it to two games Main story and DLC + Secret Location. In Main story it is really easy. Every boss was killed from 3-4 try (maybe few more, but rarely). And I play as warrior with shield and sword. For mages it would be easier. Main story is interesting and somehow every area is feeling fresh, even secret location. I used phantoms only twice, on twin princes, cos I wanted to try them and on last boss, because one of endings required them, but I am sure that you can do it without them for few trys. DLC on other hand, was a bit repetetive for me. Bosses in DLC was much harder. All of them was with multiple phases and far too much hp (compared to main story). I dont know is it + or -, but most of the enemies may be killed if you exploit environments. There is some charm in looking how to kill this fat enemy, without touching him and runing around him :). Here challenge for sure is not in grind of useless resources (souls are coming by playing the game, never sitting and farming them, line in new games). Gameplay as well is not related with doing repetitive towers and other not interesting activities. Here gameplay is related with fighting challenges, sometimes hard challenges. One advice for some of you. Souls games always missed one important thing for me: map. Some people like finding secret things around map, but I have played with online maps whole game. I have played bloodborne sole exploring... and feeling wasn't more interesting, but in the end of the game I understand that I missed 1 big location and 1 secret location and many more small locations. This is not fun for me, to miss content and to try to understand where to hit to find secret wall (running and hitting walls is boring imo). You are not losing really a lot if you just check what exist in this game and you dont miss secrets. I am happy that I succeed to pass through all secret locations and see them. Otherwise it is very possible that you will just quickly run through game and wondering, why it was that short. And don't be afraid to ask for help :). With phantoms everything is easier. Good luck ashen one.",10,2019-09-02,PC,user
AngryBaneling,"A proper Dark Souls sequel unlike Dark Souls 2. Combat is very responsive, feels better than DS2 and heavy weapons feel fantastic. Sorcery and Pyromancy have been nerfed. There's a new FP bar, tied to a new estus flask type, that drains with each use of weapon arts, Sorcery, Pyromancy, and Miracles. Not a fan of the FP bar as it's not a substitute for stamina usage. Instead, all your spells use both FP and Stamina, which is an incredibly annoying limiter placed upon you. DS3 has an actual story you can piece together. Invasions are fun too.

Artmal,"A high-quality game without any doubts. I've tried to play Dark Souls II once but the game just didn't clicked for me for some reason and I've forget about Dark Souls series for some time. But recently I gave Dark Souls III a chance. The game won my attention from the very beginning. I enjoyed literally everything about this game. The graphics are amazing and are a huge leap relatively to DS II. I liked the NPC's and bosses not to mention amazing soundtrack which I still listen from time to time. I'm giving this game a 10 because it has something that modern games lack nowadays. It makes you think. I'm not talking about the boss fight tactics, no. I'm talking about the message which you can see playing the game. Someone will see the beauty of self-imposed challenges and who knows, maybe they will take more bold challenges in their life knowing that everything is possible if you don't give up and keep trying. Others will see different perspectives on important philosophical questions and probably will take something to their lives.",10,2019-05-12,PC,user

Did-,"Such a wonderful space is the zone between frustration and awe, and such a difficult zone to pinpoint. But Dark Souls III found it and manages most of the time to stay inside its boundaries. The formula didn’t change since the first game, you die a lot. And it’s pleasant. I must admit I missed it, this difficulty which asks of me a perpetual concentration and self-control. Each enemy may be the end of your precious life, even though you slew already a dozen of those same enemies before without difficulty. “Be wary of recklessness or Time for death.” Overall, the level design is great, it’s a pleasure to explore new zones. That may be my favorite part of the game, with a quality relative to the one from Dark Souls. The levels are huge and full of secrets, traps and passageways. It's such a joy to find a shortcut or a bonfire after a difficult passage. “Could this be a shortcut? Only hope!” Each battle against a boss is like a dance. A difficult dance in which your partner can crush your bones if you don’t follow his steps carefully. But you don’t know the orders of the steps and your partner may change the current verse anytime. One misstep, and it’s a sword in your belly. “Skill required ahead, therefore try backstepping.” But even though 7 years passed between Demon Souls and Dark Souls III, I still find the user interface terrible. It’s not clear, there are too many numbers, and it’s still impossible to compare two pieces of equipment together. The camera has to be fully manned, and in combats, it can take obnoxious positions, especially against giant enemies. With a controller on PC, the right stick emulates the mouse cursor, so it’s possible on a multi-screen setup to “click” outside the game in the middle of a fight if by mistake you want to control the camera while in menus, which makes you go back to your desktop for a few, but dangerous, seconds. “Aaaah... Despair!” The game design is sometimes too obscure, notably when crafting equipments. I’d like to be able to understand the global crafting system without the need to go on the web. One can argue that it’s a design choice, and it’s consistent with the game environment, obscure and cryptic. But if I were the character in Dark Souls, I would simply ask Andre the Blacksmith how the crafting works, and he would tell me because it’s his job and he knows this stuff. “Losing sanity, If only I had a hint…” Even though it still has a lot of issues that would mean a simple rage-quit in a lot of other games, Dark Souls III has so much to offer it’d be a mistake to ignore it for these simple reasons. The game designers, especially Miyazaki Hidetaka, decided to follow an odd path with these games, and respected this path until the end, despite what the industry thought to be bankable. And in the end, they changed the said industry. Thanks for that, From Software. “Good luck, and then Praise the Sun!”",8,2019-03-22,PC,user

jrdnnn,"My first Souls game ever, and I am truly in awe of it. I hesitated buying this for ages, given its reputation for being crushingly difficult, as I wasn't sure that this would really appeal to me. However, ~50 hours of gameplay later, on completion of the game after a spontaneous buy, I could not be happier with it. The difficultly is indeed very high, but this strangely did not have the off-putting effect I expected. Instead, it spurred me on to improve my skills, try a boss one more time, take a breather to level up a bit more, or seek out a new approach to an old problem. When you die, it is ALWAYS your own fault, and the resounding quote about DS3 is that it is tough but fair. There is no artificial difficulty or cheapness, just true rewarding challenge. As a game, the controls are slick and allow for so many different combat styles (nimble and quick, slow and strong, ranged, magic-wielding, or a mix of all of the above), forcing experimentation until you settle on a comfortable style for you. The RPG element of the game is as daunting as its difficulty, but again, if you take the time to understand it, and expend a little bit of effort on the game, it reward you in spades. Again, you can tailor your approach to your play style. On levelling up, you can choose to improve your defenses, maximise your attack power or dexterity, focus on magic skills, or simply add more health if you feel you are getting battered a bit much. To complement this, there is a plethora of weapons, armour, items and spells to equip. So much choice, so much RPG number crunching and so much satisfaction in crafting a warrior to take on the horrors of Lothric. The story is at first sparse, with little to go on after a short intro video. But every character you meet and every item you pick up provides you with small bits of information which weave an intricate backstory to this fantasy universe. If you buy this game, I encourage you to read EVERYTHING. Enemy motivations, historical grudges, and explanations for otherwise obscure plotpoints enrich the story tenfold, and make Dark Souls 3 incredibly emotional and immersive. Boss fights take centre stage in Souls games, and DS3 has some truly memorable fights. Each boss has its own backstory, of course told cryptically through item descriptions, which are often tragic and add a whole new perspective to fights. You will die A LOT facing bosses, but it is always worth a few test runs to observe attack patterns, openings and timing of 2nd forms (which are almost always more aggressive). My heart was pounding during most of these battles and whether you best them first try, or on your 30th (looking at you, Dancer of the Boreal Valley), the sense of achievement is like nothing I have ever felt in a game before. If ever a game provided a true rollercoaster thrill of emotions, this is it. I often caught myself jumping and punching the air after toppling a once-formidable enemy by the skin of my teeth. The visuals are breathtaking, especially the outdoor environments. The scale of this game is incredible, and you can often see areas you completed hours ago in the distance from a new area. Dimly lit dungeons and caves, dusty castle interiors, and abandoned villages are teeming with grotesque creatures ready to rip your face off. For a world on the brink of death, it really is bursting with life, character and an odd ethereal beauty. Boss battle settings are usually spectacles, and some will stay with me forever (e.g. facing Pontiff Sulyvhan in a huge cathedral, or the Dragonslayer Armour on a decaying bridge amidst a burning inferno). The music and sound production complements the visuals, and yet again this is most prevalent for bosses, with soaring orchestral numbers ramping the tension up to 11. Quieter moments are equally as impressive- the breathing of a hideous enemy lurking in the dark, or the quality voice acting for characters you meet. Overall, DS3 is a true masterpiece which gives out so much joy to those who invest in it. This is not a game for casual players, but at the same time, I'm hardly a veteran and loved every second of it. The lore is deeper than you'd ever expect and merits digging around the many environments of Lothric for clues as to what is actually going on in this beautiful but bleak world. Do not be dissuaded by the difficulty or seemingly-obtuse lore - the gaming community in DS3 is a surprising merit to the franchise I didn't expect, and is encouraging in every way. If you put a bit of love into this game, you will find yourself with one of the deepest most atmospheric games of all time, and you will change your opinion on 'hard' series forever. I certainly have.",9,2019-02-28,PC,user

Learning from the few mistakes Bloodborne did, it is noticiably faster and more dynamic when compared to other souls games, surpassing not only Bloodborne but also the other Souls games in the series in some noticeable aspects, such as Boss Fights, indoors level design and NPC quests. The atmosphere really screams the ""ash"" theme, having not much contrast between areas, quite fitting for the end of the Cycle. Somehow playing with mouse and keyboard actually feels good when compared the the other 2 Souls games, fitting pretty well the faster gameplay. Although it has 2 noticeable flaws : replayability and PvP balancement, both that could be easily fixed but thats another discussion...

You have just one to two path open for the majority of the game. But it has some of the best bosses in the saga. And some of the worst. It has some of the best areas of the saga (level design wise) but they all lacks originality. It has a grand finale, but a slow buildup to it and quite tedius. Great NPCs questline.

Henriquez94,"Dark Souls III, simplemente maravilloso, un juego de rol-jrpg. Dark souls III, supera tus expectativas una narrativa maravillosa, con muchisima relacion al DS I, no es necesario haber jugado los anteriores souls, pero hay muchas referencias mas con el DS I. Un juego que lamentablemente esta capado a 60 fps, un port para pc, pero bien hecho. Una narrativa espectacular, una banda sonora destacable, jugabilidad de 10/10. Lo unico con lo que no estoy de acuerdo es que para entender por completo el juego debes haber jugado DS I, si quieres entender ya que muchos items la explicacion de ese item lo entenderas si has jugado DS I, hay muchos NPCs que son de DS 1, escenarios de DS1, y es de nostalgia ver que tanto a cambiado, son 3 finales de este titulo, como en DS3, el tipico final Señor Oscuro, y avivar la llama, y han añadido un final un tanto interesante, creo que da a entender el final de esta saga, aunque es probable que Miyasaki nos sorprenda sin problema alguno. Los enfrentamiento contra las boss es otro nivel, espectaculares visualmente, y su banda sonora ni hablar, magnifica. Las quests de los NPCs muy facil de arruinar, y es probable que para hacer unas cuantas tendras que buscar en internet sus requisitos o que hacer, ya que como les digo muy facil de arruinar o ignorar por su ubicacion. El mapa esta muy bien conectado y est me recuerda a DS II. Las zonas opcionales del juego son muy dificiles de encontrar mas 1 de ellas, pero si eres curioso y muy atento lo haras sin problemas. De hecho en esa zona opcional esta que para mi es el boss mas dificil del juego, que sin duda te hara pasartelo en un par de horas. El modo online de este juego es bueno, aunque nada novedoso, es igual, matchs PVP de hasta 5 o 6 jugadores sino estoy mal, gracias a un item del juego. aveces hay problemas de conexion son raras las veces y esque depende de tu ancho de banda, pero aveces hay ciertos frames de invunerabilidad que te pueden favorecer o no, pero es muy divertidos y es que en algunas zonas hasta hay clubs de la pelea en fin, muy buen juego sin dudarlo te lo recomiendo en 1000%, aunque no hayas jugado a los anteriores, lo disfrutaras mucho, en lo personal para mi es el mejor de la saga, y es por su jugabilidad, siempre opino lo mismo los DS anteriores son dificiles por su apartado grafico, muchos frames de vulnerabilidad. Me compre el titulo en PC, STEAM, llevo 100 Horas, y es por que quiero el 100% del titulo. Lo compre entorno a $15, y su DLC en $3 el ashe of ariandel, aun no lo juego, pero por ese precio vale la pena. Mi perfil en steam es: jaga-9403. Saludos.",9,2018-04-02,PC,user

GoldenKing95,"I've finally played through Dark Souls 3, and it reminded me of what a unique series this is! The god-like feel you get as a player from this game is truly outstanding. With the music that gets you hyped, the ""You died"" message that does exactly the opposite, and game-play which captivates the reward/punish really well. At the start you feel weak, and everything is punishing, then you progress, you get better, everything is easier, but wait, new area, everyone is stronger now, you underestimate them, and then you recycle this whole sentence again and again! But boy, does it feel rewarding at times. The ""You died"" message will show many times in this game, and to me, for most of the time it feels righteous, since it mostly is your own fault when you die! There are also plenty of bosses, who feel unique, and depending on which play-style you use, some bosses will be a lot harder then others in different playthroughs! This game is something everyone should experience sometime in their life, and it's alright if it isn't for you, that just means you are a ""casual""!

PappyBakesCakes,"This game takes immersion, realism and atmosphere to the nth degree. The flow of combat and the eroding world fills you with this feeling of stagnation with jumps of remembrance of days foregone. The animation can be a bit floaty and the music is non-existent outside boss fights but these both help you appreciate the meticulously crafted environments and the stories told through them. Imo the combat was perfected in Dark Souls 2 and the only difference here is a feeling of aggression or desperation from the enemies, similar to Bloodborne. You can still play this game carefully but overusing a shield is punished a bit. The graphics are beautiful but there is so much detail that it can display jaggies quite often, even on the highest settings and also there were framerate issues when it came out but I haven't faced any for a while. There are many bosses, including one gimmick boss, that are interesting and difficult in their own rights and the regular enemies are incredibly varied and tough in their own right. If I were to say anything bad about this game, besides possible technical difficulties, I would say the lack of cohesion in the environmental storytelling is something that baits and doesnt satisfy sometimes.

Jenne,"Unfortunately most complains revolve around the PC port and controls. Honestly, if you've played DS1 and DS2 ports, then DS3 port will look positively fantastic. And M&K controls...they're fine. At least the game doesn't need any third-party tweaks and patches this time around. But who cares about bugs and control issues in a Dark Souls game? The series has always been about four gigantic virtues - the combat, the vibe, the surprise/exploration, the on-line element. Demon's Souls, DS1, DS2 Scholar and Bloodborne always delivered fully on all fronts. DS2 needed all the DLCs and a light remake to achieve it but now it's an excellent game. Unfortunately DS3 delivers only on the combat. Everything else feels incredibly disinterested and by-the-numbers. For casual fans or people who came to the franchise only now it won't matter, they don't know any better. But if there's anything that can absolutely kill a Souls ****'s the lack of soul. Dark Souls 3 is a Souls game without a soul. Playing any other FromSoft game you can feel the love and care, the attention to detail, the delightful secrets, little surprises and devious tricks. DS3 is not completely devoid of those but you can palpably feel that this time around the developers just wanted to make the product and ship it out. After all Miyazaki said many times he doesn't want to make another Souls game and it shows. DS3 almost feel as if it was outsourced to someone else - they met the minimum requirements for a solid Souls game but didn't add much more. Parts of the game even feel like unfinished stumps - the poise system is clearly a makeshift solution of someone who just can't make heavy armor work properly, there's a system for absolving sin but no sin mechanics, the covenant system is much simpler and worse than even in DS1 which is just shocking. The New Game + is incredibly phoned-in, especially after the excellent NG+ system in DS2. The world is even more linear than in DS2, and all this after the stink the community raised in reaction to DS2. As if From didn't care anymore. All in all, DS3 is a skillfully animated corpse. The body still moves fine and may even fool newcomers but there's no soul anymore. Vast majority of the old delightful, devious playfulness, inventiveness and spirit is gone and what we are left with is mostly a polished mass market product. A difference between a fabulous dish by a French master chef and the same dish prepared by KFC - the calories are still there but most of the flavour and surprise is gone.",7,2017-12-01,PC,user

SomeGuy143,"I'll start with some background on my experience with this series. Four or five years after Dark Souls 1 came out I bought it on PC and absolutely hated it. My main problems with the game were that it was disgusting to look at due to terribly dated graphics combined with a world that uses only variations of grey and brown, the combat was slow and just felt off, and the game was so, so difficult. It was nothing but a frustrating experience and I thought I was done with this series forever. However, I decided a year after Dark Souls 3 came out to give it a shot. I'm glad I did. Pros: The game is gorgeous. It may not have the graphical fidelity **** like Crysis 3 but it's good enough that the wonderful art style can carry the visuals of the game on its own. The combat is much faster, more responsive, and enjoyable than what I experienced in Dark Souls 1. The difficulty is just right. So long as you take each death as a learning experience you will not find this game to be too difficult or too frustrating. It is challenging but all the tools you need to beat the game are given to you -- you just have to learn to use them. This makes for a very rewarding experience. The game strikes a very nice balance of linearity and exploration. It actually made me realize that I don't necessarily like a perfectly open world in my RPGs as the total freedom usually causes a lack of direction that can make for a lot of boring moments as you try to find something to do. Amazing enemy variety. Every time you make it to a new area in the game there is a whole new world of enemies to fight. They're all very well designed visually and really do fight like a new enemy instead of a reskin of something you saw 10 hours back. This was, to me, one of the most impressive things about the game. Lots of unique weapons, spells, etc. that all can change the way you approach combat. Very little need to ever stop and manage your inventory. The game is pretty long. So far I've put in 60 hours. I haven't finished it yet but I think I'm getting close to finishing the base game. Cons: Too little explanation of what certain NPCs, items, etc do. You can very, very easily miss important quests if you don't spend some time on the wiki. However, I think the game is generally more enjoyable the less you research it on the wiki so it's a bit of a catch-22. I would recommend looking up some things though. For instance, you'll want to look up how to initiate co-op since it's fairly unintuitive but can be really useful for overcoming bosses that you're having trouble with. PvP is stupidly difficult. At this point people have figured out all sorts of wacky builds that are just hellish to go up against and make for a very unenjoyable time. I'd largely recommend ignoring PvP altogether unless you are very good at the game, have achieved a high level, and done a lot of research into optimal PvP builds. Otherwise you're just going to be throwing yourself into a meat grinder repeatedly. Some stuttering on the PC version. Generally it's not a huge issue but it can be frustrating when it occurs at tense moments in a fight. A controller is basically required to play this game. Verdict: Overall, this is a challenging, and for that reason rewarding, experience that I think many can enjoy so long as they have patience and aren't easily frustrated. Don't let the super hardcore ""git good"" types that dominate the online forums push you away from this game. The only masochistic portion of this game is PvP which is only a minuscule portion of the game and can be forgone completely.",8,2017-11-09,PC,user

Mancinod,"All of you saying it is a 0 out of 10 are actually complete and utter idiots, a 0 out of 10 means that something fails on ALL LEVELS. Just because you ""didn't know where to go"", or you say ""it's too hard for me"" doesn't mean it's a bad game. First of all, this game has some really amazing scenery, and while it's world's areas aren't connected with each other as well as the first Dark Souls, it still excels at immersing you in. Story:The story is hard to follow, but once you figure it out, it really is an amazing story. Gameplay: Yes, it's harder than other games. And yes, it rewards patient people. This doesn't mean it's bad. Multiplayer: Not that great, Co-op is pretty solid, it now scales down phantoms so that you no longer have to level up alongside your friends. The invasion system has been ruined in my opinion. In Dark souls 2, the invasion system was amazing, when the host and phantoms were co-oping throughout the level, phantoms and the host could heal normally. But once there was an invader, the invader and the phantom were not able to use their estus flasks anymore, thus creating tension. This system rewarded spell and miracle builds greatly, not making them almost useless. But in Dark souls 3, Phantoms and invaders are able to use their estus freely, reducing tension and favoring the host, since the host and phantom could take turns fighting the invader till he runs out of estus. That's it for this review, I'm still mad about those 0 out of 10s. Those guys are dumbasses",8,2017-10-05,PC,user
thomaddox4,"A very solid game, but not without its problems. Extremely linear, which is a huge disappointment given the metroidvania style world of dark souls 1, combat that's a mix between Dark Souls 1 and Bloodborne that ends up being significantly worse than either of them, and a lack of creativity in lore are some of the major flaws, however if you are a fan of the series I would still recommend it. The game looks great, with detailed levels (even if they don't connect in interesting ways), controls are polished, the upgrade system is the best its ever been, and in spite of the fast travel ruining much of the sense of atmosphere the individual levels themselves can still be immersive when you don't leave them frequently. If you haven't played Dark Souls 1 yet, you need to wait until you have to play this one. If you play this first you may find it harder to get into 1, and it's too much of a masterpiece to have it ruined for you from this game altering your expectations of what this type of game is like.",8,2017-09-20,PC,user

OberiousLocke,"How do criticize a game like Dark Souls? It's particularly hard. A staggering majority of the fan base are just go brain dead and start spouting ""hurr durr git gud lololololol"" at the thought of any slight criticism of the Souls games, because if you have any issue with the games, it's your fault for being bad at the game even when it's objectively not. It always seems that there is a fine mix of the ""Git gud"" brain dead and the ones that will consistently say regardless of what is said that X boss/monster/area is actually really fair, interesting and one of their favorites in the entire series. There is always one of those. The only reason I'm giving this the score that it I am is because story and world amount to a very large chunk **** quality, regardless of what the typical gamer stereotype would like to believe. I've never been TOO big on the whole show-dont-tell approach that Dark Souls takes, but I certainly appreciate the story all the same, it's one of three series' (the other being Mass Effect and Dragon Age) that can get me to legitimately care about the world and the people in it, and it's history. That being said, the series has been on a very steady decline gameplay wise post Dark Souls 1. In Dark Souls 1, if you put the work in to build a good character, you would be rewarded by becoming justifiably strong. You would struggle, bleed, and die over and over again, but you would rise and become a force to be reckoned with. Unfortunately, after Dark Souls 1 was released, it's reputation for tough-but-fair difficulty superseded everything else about it, as Dark Souls 2 and 3 both have a feeling like the Dev's were afraid of undershooting the difficulty, and so cranked it to an excessive degree, though 3 got the brunt of it, in hindsight, thus allowing the games reputation for difficulty to become the games sole identity. For example, take Lothric Castle. By the end of the game I had roughly 1.3k in HP while embered. I was farming for souls outside the Twin Princes fight, after realizing that with the Shield of Want + Cov. Silver Serpent Ring that they dropped an okay amount. Specifically, it was the red-eyed knights. In 3, red-eye's = big trouble, the ninja skeleton in Catacombs can attest to that. The number of times that I had 50-75% of my health taken out in one hit by these mobs makes me wonder why exactly people praise this game. Another prime example of the overdone difficulty is the Twin Princes fight itself. It seems manageable at first, if not a little screwy because of Lorian's teleport. That is, until a minute or two into the fight when Lorian whips out his obnoxious ground laser attack that does a usually deadly and frankly absurd amount of damage and has a wonky hitbox. Lets say you get past that and the high damage he deals in general, you kill him. You think you've won? Oh no, that was just the first phase you silly scrub. Now in addition to everything else, Lorian becomes unkillable as his little invalid brother clings to his back raining magic down on your head, while teleporting, while also retaining his shiny white death beam attack, giving you very little time to counter or heal of recover stamina unless you are god-tier on your timing. To put the cherry on top, without magic or a big honking sword, you cannot damage Lothric (the primary goal of the entire damn fight) until you kill Lorian again, and even then, you get like 5 seconds to get hits in before he explodes, dealing heavy damage, resurrecting Lorian, and starting it all over again. I'd not be doing my job writing this if I didn't at least touch on PvP in some aspect. People like to say that Dark Souls 1 had a OP twink problem, but reflecting on my experiences in 1, then 2 and 3, 3 sees that twink problem and goes ""Hold my beer"". Case in point, I was a lowbie helping another lowbie through Undead Settlement, when suddenly we're invaded by a lowbie brandishing the Dragonslayer Armor boss weapon, twinked out taking little damage, and one shotting the both of us in one swing. One shotting the player, PvE or PvP, in any game, is never acceptable in any circumstances. It's fun to have a fair chance then die because you screwed up. It's frustrating to be killed while feeling like you never had a fair chance. None of this is helped by the fact that the community of honor and unwritten rules that made 1's PvP so endlessly good has withered to a husk, and are now routinely called ""Le edgy honors lel ecksdee scrubs"" by the new members of the Souls community that weren't around in the first game's heyday. There are some holdouts in this regard, but they are far outnumbered. They also took one step forward and another back, in my opinion. They thankfully removed that stupid Soul Memory system, but also allowed invaders to use their flasks again. Combined with the facts I mentioned above, and their tendency to chug estus while parry/backstab fishing makes the PvP in this game insufferable.",5,2017-07-25,PC,user
iPotat,"With this series I started to get acquainted with only 3 parts of Dark Souls. I was aware of its complexity, but did not attach much importance. Now I decided to get acquainted with this series. We play for the non-combatant - a restless soul whose body was rejected by the flames The game itself takes place in the kingdom of Lotrr at the junction of many powerful kingdoms that belonged to the rulers of the ashes, but eventually, as a result of certain incidents, these lands turned into half-ruined ruins inhabited only by vile creatures The game represents the path from point A to the boss (B), along the way we meet different mobs. From light to pizetskhykatyavki, as well as you can meet an NPC with side quests or a trader. We have 10 classes with different game styles to choose from. You can be a knight, you can be a magician, but you can take a vagabond and assemble your class, thanks to the extensive leveling of the level allows. Bleeding occurs at the expense of spending souls, which drop out from various mobs. In the game a large arsenal of weapons, shields, spells, everyone will find his own. From the combat system, you can note a bad camera and the management of the character. With some bosses there will be difficulties due to the camera itself. Separately I want to mention the soundtrack and design of locations. Each location is not similar to the previous one, here its secrets, mobs, its boss and its NPC. The locations themselves are connected with each other by bonfires (for quick movement and saves). The variety of mobs in each location pleases, they are not similar to each other. And all this is added to the soundtrack, which is worth the soundtrack in the main menu. Bosses are different: from slow to fast, from big to small, from strong to weak, and each boss needs his own approach. Sometimes bosses are able to greatly surprise. Either somehow change during a fight, or you have to kill by special, or in the arena with the boss will happen some kind of garbage Even if you can not get through the boss you can call for help from a phantom (other players or bots) The plot is revealed due to the descriptions of objects and we will have to collect it by pieces. So it will be much to read. The most terrible thing in the game is the network part. Terrible net code, the balance of hostile phantoms. Horseradish understand how to get hit by weapons on the model player. Coop in the game is present, but made in the traditions through the anus. It is connected through time, and can not connect at all. In general, the game turned out good, not too complicated, interesting and exciting. His money is worth.

DoeJohn,"In my opinion.... I love it. Especially because the game designers did not bother to finish the game properly and they left it full of bugs. Ex. You hit and it doesn't take life, they hit and it takes all 80% of yours. Probably, they wanted it to be a ""very hard"" to beat game. Its crazy. Beside that it a very good game that reminds me of Lineage or WOW. As well, there are some spells, that are not really practical to use and some that you will never use because is not worth to attune them, because they are a waste of space. I recently arrived to the Demon Prince fight in Ringed City, a fight that is really hard for me to win. I will win it, eventually, but my question **** even bother?!?!?! I am playing, because it is my way of relaxing after a stressful day or week at work, because this is my way to deconnect. In my opinion, gaming should be about experiences that are emotionally entertaining and intelectually mind blowing and which do not cause any frustration. I gave it a ten, because I like the game, because the game is good ( in my opinion ), but I arrived to the point, when I am asking, why should I waste my time with this game, when it is not entertaining anymore. Why bother?!!?! And the game has a way with you, that you might become frustrated after a while, and so, you have to remember that it isn't the controller's fault or the console (XBOX ONE ) It is the game. Who knows, maybe in the next update, the things will be fair. But then again, Why bother with it?!?! Cheers.",10,2017-05-25,PC,user

DariushL,"Single Player Review: 9/10 Dark Souls3 had to perk the series from the averageness of DS2 back to the magnificence of DS1. The main hub, the firelink shrine area, get soon crowded with NPCs and while intended to be a ""cesspool of doddering oldfolk and degenerates"", it doesnt feels like a believable place. I know it works as Demon's Soul' Nexus did, but i never playied that so i cant really compare the two. Also, the magic of a open world, connected from top to bottom, as it was in DS1, its partially lost here; while the world design is much better than in DS2, it isnt as good as DS1. Levels are much larger, but the way they connects still miss the natural flow of the original game. The design of enemies and bosses is generally very consistent with the environments; the style direction is well above DS2, even if some odd enemy placement can be still found. Areas are packed with loot with steep spikes in difficulty when the player get away from the path to the area boss to adventure in completionist territory, as in some optional areas. Still, the sensation that the game relies, too often, on enemie's numbers, rather than quality, remains. The fighting system is very reminiscent of that of DS2, but much faster, enriched by the weapon arts option, wich is a fancy name for the expanded weapon moveset; also the gameplay is deeper thanks to the option of juggling the estus between HP and FP, giving more options to wizards/ hybrid characters; hitboxes on enemies is generally fair, apart from some boss. The camera and targeting system is far from perfect, presenting some problems in tight spaces packed with enemies and an even shorter locking distance than in DS1/2. A number of time you'll try to lock on to enemy while retreating, only to reset the camera...definitely ONE OF THE GAME'S LOWEST POINTS. Graphics are good, presenting amazing sceneries most of the times, while, purely technically, the game is still reminiscent of DS2sotfs. So, artistically excellent, lacking a true ""next gen"" look all around. Colour palette is perfect, the colours are more vivid than DS1 but it isnt the mess DS2 presented. The OST, sadly, is nothing special. While DS1 has some memorable tracks,(the malinconic main menu and ending theme, the terrifying asylum demon/taurus demon theme, the magnificent Ornstein/Smough theme or the final Gwyn's piano theme), DS3 tracks are truly forgettable. Not terrible, but nothing to write home about. Sounds are very good instead. final note: works well on 360 controller as well as on M&K. Actually, camera control is soo much better with mouse! bossfight will be much easier! 9/10 +excellent artistic choices +captivating narrative and world +challenging gameplay +amazing level design +good replay value +cool online features as usual -inconstistent camera and targeting system -disappointing bosses OST at times",9,2017-04-15,PC,user
SomeName,"A great game from one of my favourite series of all time. I thoroughly enjoyed the graphics, design and gameplay experience. That doesn't mean that it has no issues, but I found I got plenty for the money spent. I would also say that this type of game isn't for everyone. There is no clear guidance or hand-holding and the combat is challenging, although rarely to the point of being arbitrarily difficult. Pros: -Strong action & combat. -Good story (although it requires a bit of effort to piece together) -Quality graphics and effects, although there is the occasional drop in framerate (nothing that renders it unplayable though). -Worthwhile DLCs (particularly the Ringed City). -Some of the best (and memorable) level design in gaming. Cons: -The PC support is still sub-par. By no means as bad as Dark souls 1 or 2, but still not at a level where I would recommend playing it on anything but a controller. -Some recycled material from the previous games. -Bugs, hackers and various kinds of **** in the online play, but try finding online multiplayer without that. In general I would say this is was a good series. Different from most of the RPG hack-and-slashers in the genre. Try it if you want something new (if you find the story interesting, I recommend playing DS1 & DS2 first though).",9,2017-04-09,PC,user

tomvs123,"Story and atmosphere are what I value most. Dark Souls is excellent in this respect, Bloodborne is even better. Dark Souls 2 was the absolute worst, and Dark Souls 3 is in between Dark Souls 1 and 2. Gameplay is exactly what I expected. The standard Souls formula with minor tweaks. A few minor annoyances remain, like weapon switches not happening reliability depending on the animation you're in, dodges happening after you're hit/stagger animation, even though you hit the dodge button while you were getting hit, and the almost worthlessness (or extreme difficulty) of attempting to play the game primarily as a spell caster. The story, lore, atmosphere, and characters really let me down, coming from Bloodborne. I thought it would at least be equal, but it's all definitely worse. If I would have known that, I would have passed on the game. There's no big surprises in the story. What you start out to achieve is what you end up achieving. You're told exactly what you need to do. There's no figuring things out like with the original or Bloodborne. And the characters are comparatively lifeless. The few bits of dialogue they have are they same bits of dialogue they have for the entire game. Playing this, I can't stop thinking about the doll in Bloodborne, and absolutely amazing she is at being a character and at adding to the full package. Imagine Bloodborne without the doll, without the story-based cinematics, with 1/3rd of the number of interactable characters, and in a different (and more generic) setting, and you get Dark Souls 3. So I give it an average score for being an average game to me.",5,2017-03-25,PC,user

21grams,"If you played previous Dark Souls games you know what to expect so I'm not going into detail on this. The game is great but not everything is perfect. I like they bumped up the tempo and pace, it definitely makes the game more fun and I would rate it higher if not the bosses. In my opinion, they did pretty poor job with the bosses on their lazy design. Basically the issue is as follows: some bosses are way too easy to the point you can nearly ignore everything they do, some are rather well balanced - hard but with good learning curve to beat them and some are basically hard because non stop spam of attacks, where you basically dodge 10 times in 10s with small gaps to get another round of spam - you get tired or fall asleep because of this routine and you die just because of that. Frankly I find this lame and lazy design. So basically some bosses should have been clever and harder and some should be more tactical than spamy, Other than that the game lives up to its expectations and it's sad this franchise ends.

Sky-Moondrift,"Yet another disgustingly shabby console port by FS. - Resolution capped at 1080p - Hideously bad textures (playstation 2 lvl bad) - Fugly 2D backdrops resembling that of a SNES game. - Forced mouse acceleration - Input prompts and UI are for XBOX not PC. - Extremely bad character models - Console UI - No UI scaling - Does in no way improve upon the first DS game both technically or aesthetically. + I got a Refund The game itself could be good, I don't know, I spent my first hour trying to comprehend how terrible this port is and looking for ways to fix it.

Arroyo_man,"I dunno man. I'm playing it but not feel any vibes. More weapons, better graphics (arguably, personally i prefer old rendering methods) more Npcs, but everything feels so flat, so... hollow. You finding a key IN FRONT of the gate... Seriously? No hidden locations like Ash Lake. I'm coming do DkS1 just to enter the Ash Lake and enjoy the atmosphere. There is no places like that in DkS3 at all. Locations are very narrow. You go straight forward from one bonfire to another, nothing in between. Speaking about bonfires, there is waaaay too many of them. In one place you can see bonfire from a ... bonfire :) Mobs are moving too fast, stamina is gone, poise is just cosmetic. It's look like from soft wanted to pleased wider audience, some newcomers and soul vets. No guys it won't work and i must admit i've lost some amount of respect for you.

Voretechz,"Dark Souls 3 is a great game. I love Souls games and this game did not disappoint me in the least. It isn't my favourite one but It is still amazing none the less and the DLC makes it even better! FromSoftware is freaking awesome at making DLC worth your time and money. I have already clocked over 250 hours in this game and I am still having great fun. The performance is nearly perfect on PC, the combat is tight, and the challenge is back in full force, the multiplayer summoning actually works, the story is pretty well done and finishes off the trilogy well, the NPC's all have interesting quest lines with rewards, the weapon, armor and spell variety is vast and the covenants are pretty cool and make for some insane PvP battles. Dark Souls 3 unsurprisingly gets a resounding recommendation from me. If you like Souls, you will love this game.",9,2016-12-06,PC,user
Gamer-critic,"So, basically, this game is amazing, it has awesome lore, deeper than ever, cool-designed bosses, tons of weapons, spells, armor sets, items and etc. Locations are beautiful and well designed too. But... This game will not amaze you as it was with previous games, there is no so much cool game play moments (mind, that combat system and game play itself is still great) that will blow your mind, as it was with previous games. Coop became better, glad From Soft took password system as in Bloodborne, PvP is almost the best of the whole game series. But after 10 hours of play through, you will admit, that Miyazaki, no matter how cool he is, tired from souls games, you can see it almost in every aspect of the game.

TemplarGR,"Well, to get this out of the way first, the port is good. it is playable, but you need a controller. This game is hell with keyboard and mouse. But i won't focus on that, because the main game is trash anyway. Just know that i have played it properly with a gamepad, and my criticism is not about the port. If you try to be objective for a moment, and look at this as a piece of software, comparing it with the competition, you can't help but wonder how can this compare to other AAA games of its era. Graphics are bad, animations and hitboxes are archaic, controls are literally trash. Sound is nothing special, music, what is music? Dialogs are few. The character system is bad and not explained, you can't design a good character without a guide. Enemy AI is non-existant, enemies just stand on their place and just hit you with swords/arrows/whatever. They are just hit point sponges. There are bugs. This game could have been created with 4-5 interns at best. This is no AAA. Then we have the supposed ""difficulty"". Make no mistake, this game is not difficult, it is cheap. Let no blinded fanboy and ""hardcore gamer"" tell you otherwise. There is nothing difficult with Dark Souls. If it had a proper save system and allowed proper difficulty settings (easy/medium/hard), it would have been much, much easier than other games, because there is literally no enemy AI on this game. If you play Skyrim on the hardest setting, enemies can become HP sponges too, and hit you harder. Same thing, on a far better video game. You don't have to be a good gamer to complete this game. I am all for a challenge, but i am 33 years old, and my time is limited. I don't have the time to die 500x times, lose all progress and have to travel all the way again, or grind endlessly in order to beat a boss. That **** should have died in the 80s/90s. This is not difficulty, this is tedium. Difficulty is trying to beat a hard AI in chess. Having to grind to win a boss or die repeatedly to learn its patterns, is just a way to waste hours of your life for no reason. It is just BAD DESIGN. A proper human being, that means not a basement dweller, has no time for this ****. Last but not least, there is no reward for suffering to complete this game. The story is trash, the lore is trash. You have nothing to gain by completing this, other than ""bragging rights"". For me, if anyone, and i mean, anyone, comes to me and tells me that ""he is a hardcore gamer because he wasted hours of his life dying cheap deaths in order to finish a non AAA console port"", it is a litmus test for being an idiot. ""sure bra, you completed this abomination, what a life accomplishment you made!"" All the while normal people play real games to relax for fun. They accomplish things were it really matters, in real life, not in a trashy video game made to torment them and waste their time. Time is precious and short on this planet. I can't explain the high scores of this game by reviewers. Typically, the metacritic scores it has achieved are reserved for classics and masterpieces, and this trash is not. Also, typically, Japanese games have become garbage in the PS3 generation and afterwards. Repetitive trash with low production values. From software was a small japanese developer never known for any good game prior to this. So how come they made it? I believe it is a combination of ""marketing"" (read:bribes), younger gamers' inexperience and vanity, and Stockholm syndrome. Sony and Japanese gamers/media, have every reason to attempt to push this cheap trash as a ""masterpiece"" in order to make a comeback in the industry. They don't have the budgets/expertise to compete with western AAA, with a few exceptions, so they get ""creative"" promoting obsolete design as a virtue. Professional reviewers don't want to score it lower to not be called ""n00bs"" and told to ""git gud"". They typically never finish their games, they almost always play on easy, but somehow they adore Dark Souls... Yeah right... Kids with no accomplishments in their real life, are eager to show off by finishing this turd, and then go online and tell everyone and their dog about it. And they call anyone who won't suffer this garbage ""a casual"". Most of those kids have completed this game by sheer repetition and grinding, or with guides and cheats. Yet they want to keep the appearence of having fun with it, because admitting this is trash, will make them having to admit they wasted their time and what they accomplished is nothing special. Or maybe they are kids, so they don't value their time. Probably the reason for the whole popularity. I have even seen a best game ever list on us gamer, putting Dark Souls on No1 spot. That is after the release of Witcher 3... Calling it a master piece and work of genius. My God, the emperor has no clothes. Are these clowns getting paid to write this? Waste no time with this series of games. Next time someone calls you a ""casual"" for it, just laugh at his face. This fad will be over soon.",2,2016-09-09,PC,user

Going through packs of trash mobs can be frustrating as they stagger you over and over, especially when you realise you can just run/roll past everything You get hit through walls I would say DS3 is a better souls game: Better graphics Faster paced gameplay, the 10s animations of ds1/2 were killing me The PC version actually works out of the box for once, although it still feels like a poor port when you see controller controls everywhere",7,2016-08-19,PC,user

Checkpoints are usually far from one another and if you are cautious and prefer to take the shortest way, you can miss a lot of content. A lot of the fights in the game, including boss fights do not offer anything different and there is very little room for tactics - mostly always it's ""hit first and roll out, or take a hit and you won't make it to the next checkpoint"".

Sharb,"The single player game along Witcher 3! Pros: People say this game has no story but in my opinion this game has one of the best stories ever made. It will be hard to search for the real story because it's hidden in item descriptions, statues etc. all over the map. There are tons of great interpretations on youtube, you should definitely check out VaatiVidya if you have ever played this game. It might not be the hardest game ever made but it's definitely challenging enough for me after grinding through most of the modern games. This is definitely a huge positive for me. Great environment. The graphics are maybe not as good as in some newer games like Witcher 3 but how everything is laid out, it's beautiful in a hard to explain way. People complain about the game being only about rolling and hitting but there's more behind that. Different bosses are weak to different types or damage and you can take advantage of that to make the bosses a little easier. Most of the enemies can be riposted with a perfectly timed parry and you can try and get behind them to backstab for extra damage. There's also sorceries, pyromancies and miracles that can be used to buff your weapons, cast spells, heal your allies, make you invisible/more resistant to magic etc. Dark souls 3 is very replayed in my opinion. I have completed the game 4 times with my main character and just started another run with a different class. There are 4 different endings and the enemies gain more health and give you more souls on each New game +. Cons: The game was developed to be played with a controller so they don't give you any instructions if you're playing with a keyboard. It's not a big problem if you are able to type ""dark souls 3 pc controls"" in Google. The PvP is pretty laggy because of ping.

Captain_Chaos,"If you pick a fight with the devil, you better be stronger then hell. A surprising turnaround from the second game, at least for me. Series features I continue to not like (invasions, the weird co-op system, a lack of effective anti-cheat measures, spotty netcode) are tempered by extremely improved mouse and keyboard controls, among other things. I cannot overstate this: the shoddy controls are what ruined Dark Souls 2 for me and made it one of the most unrewarding games I've ever played. When this game was announced, you could hear me roll my eyes. But this is not Dark Souls 2. I am told it is rather more like Bloodborne, but since I've not played that gamae I'll have to take their word for it. What it is is a surprisingly competent action RPG with flexible character progression, varied armor and weapons, impressive vistas and, if I have to be honest, actually challenging gameplay with, at least in my first playthrough, far fewer cheap shots then in the second game. There were almost no moments in my first run where I felt the game was being unfair in the fights, but having a gaggle of friends certainly helps. It also has a lion's share of continuity nods for fans of the first Dark Souls, which, unfortunately, I have also not played. The end of days has come upon the ruined lands of Lordran, and there is but one task left of any import. A tolling of an ancient bell has risen you, a nameless undead, from an unmarked grave. Your quest is to bring to heel the wayward Lords of Cinder, and use the power granted by their ashes to decide the fate of a dying world. To do that, you'll need souls. Lots of souls. Dark Souls 3 does away with the level bracketing ""Soul Memory"" system of 2, allowing friends to summon each other freely into their worlds, so long as they have not yet defeated a boss. However, the small white sign soapstone has also been omitted, making summoning friends into completed areas much more difficult, requiring the use of the red sign and an item that allows AI enemies to attack and be attacked by invaders. The netcode has been improved from 2 considerably, making finding and summoning allies a much less tedious affair, and a preponderance (some have said overly so) of bonfires make it so that you never have very far to walk. The neutral zone of Firelink Shrine is separate from from the main game areas, and can be stocked with a variety of NPCs, some of whom have sidequests for you to complete, and a variety of weapons, armor, spells, and items to sell. Many say that Dark Souls is a throwback to an era of gaming where games did not, quote, ""hold your hand."" But in many cases this translates simply to a lack of conveniences you would expect from other modern-day RPGs. My number one complaint: The total and utter lack of a map system. Lucky as I was, I had friends to guide me through the game, but on the rare occasion they were not with me I would quickly find myself completely and utterly lost. Dark Souls 3's environments consist largely of cathedrals and castles, with the occasional sewer or swamp, and there are very few landmarks with which to get your bearings. There is also no form of quest tracker or objective marker telling you where to go for anything, leaving you to blindly stumble along, presumably into an area with enemies much more powerful then those you should be facing at your current level. At least there's a wiki. It would be very easy to screw up side quests if you didn't know what you were doing going in, locking you out of certain rewards entirely for that run. It also suffers from somewhat uninspired musical direction (with the exception of the hauntingly beautiful theme of the Dancer of the Boreal Valley) and at least one completely lackluster ending. The multiplayer system continues to be a mechanic that others find integral to Dark Souls and one that I find clumsy and irritating. There is no other game series I know of where a player can enter your game uninvited and actively hinder you from progressing in the story. I am aware you can simply play offline, but this also prevents you from summoning friendly players, and I am reasonably sure I would not have had the patience for some of the boss fights without help. I also lament the lack of a true co-op experience as in any other game, instead of forcing you to replay the game several times over for each of your friends, though, the improved controls and a better choice of stats and gear on my part this time around alliviated that to a not-insignificant degree. Considering this is Dark Souls, I really didn't die very often, and I am more relieved by that then anything. Series problems aside, on its own merits I found Dark Souls 3 rather entertaining. The core combat is very solid with, I feel, a lot of room to experiment tactically, and even fighting invaders was for the most part, fun- barring one occasion with an incredibly obvious and indestructable hacker. I have to admit I did not expect to like any part of the game going in. I felt pressured to play this game, and this is the first time I can remember enjoying a game I intially did not want to play. I even found myself playing it alone, getting myself summoned as a Warrior of Sunlight to assist other players against the game's many thrilling boss battles, by far the highlight of the game, in jolly co-operation. I also attempted to be a Blue Sentinel and a Blade of the Darkmoon, but found it difficult to be summoned in this way. I almost regret that this is supposedly the final entry in the series. I can only hope that future RPGs by From Software follow this game's example.",8,2016-06-22,PC,user
captainkane,"Dark Souls III is a decent game. But it’s the safest and most frustrating in the series. DS3 brings back many familiar elements while neglecting to fix problems that afflict every DS game, such as janky hit boxes, embarrassing frame rates, and broken targeting. Also, I can’t highlight enough the boring and unbalanced PvP. After the perceived Dark Souls 2 tragedy, many critics laud DS3 as being a “return to form”, but that really translates to “more of the same”. For people who sank 100+ hours into the original DS, this newest entry feels too familiar. Performance wise, DS3 is barely passable. It’s prone to random crashes, stuttering, and freezes. Even with all graphic settings turned down, DS3 can’t push out a consistent 60fps at 1080p. I even lowered the resolution by 20% and still couldn’t achieve the target rate. The environments aren’t nearly as detailed as the Witcher 3 or Shadow of Mordor, so the problem isn’t detail. Although DS3 has long draw distances, remote objects are so poorly rendered they remind me of Castlevania 64. Boss battles push DS3 to its limit since those are where the biggest fps spikes occur. All evidence points to bad optimization, which is something gamers see in every DS game. Does DS3 look good? Barely. But DS2, also look good at launch while performing markedly better. The camera is a problem. A BIG problem. In DS3, enemies move faster, use more vertical movements, and spam attacks. However, the third person camera is set too close to the character to properly track foes. In close quarters the camera will get hung up on walls. When fleeing enemies your character may not be visible as the camera positions itself on the baddies’ butts. The camera will peer up thru the floor if enemies jump above the character. People have suggested turning off target tracking to allow manual camera control, but then spells, bombs, projectiles, and pyromancy become useless. Still, the lock-on feature is broken most of the time anyway. Its range is incredibly short. And target locks will cease for unknown reasons. Many times, I’ll cast a spell just as the target lock ceases, so my character spins around and tosses magic at the camera. However, I’m able to turn back around, reacquire those same targets and cast spells even though enemies moved further away. Failed lock-ons can cause players to spin 180 degrees, exposing their backs to enemies. Enemies will often use the opportunity to execute lethal backstabs. This problem is especially common with foes at the edge of doorways. Poor performance and the awful camera negatively impact combat. But that isn’t enough for From. It has to add janky hit boxes to the mix. I can thrust a great sword square into enemies’ chests—the tip pokes thru their backs—and still not register hits. I can roll away from attacks and take damage after the attack animations have ended. Even worse, enemy spells/projectiles track players and splash damage from enemy magic is ridiculous. Arrows will curve around corners. Fire attacks can pass thru stone walls, boulders, and even track players up and down stairs. All these issues make combat an exasperating experience. As a result of all these problems, DS3 feels more difficult because many deaths are cheap. They’re the result of all the bugs and broken mechanics. So in many instances, death isn’t the fault of the players. It’s immensely frustrating. PvP is a joke. It’s just players endlessly rolling around to avoid damage. That’s pretty much the gist of it. Co-op is OK. Lag still rears its ugly head in multiplayer. I doubt it’ll get fixed. As for the rest of the game… For players who trudged thru the original Dark Souls, they’re getting a nearly identical experience in DS3. From has taken cues from Activision by creating a franchise that releases are nearly identical products every cycle. DS3 sacrifices innovation for mass market appeal. This actually breaks the immersion because all the environments and enemies feel samey. The story is as cryptic as ever, but lacks much of the depth I felt in DS2 and the haunting futility of DS1. Although I wasn’t a huge fan of DS2 at the time, developers made risky decisions. Dark Souls 2 retooled combat and equipment mechanics, broadened spell casting, beefed up NG+, introduced the biggest variety of enemies, and incentivized multiplayer (while also improving it). Level design and boss fights were downers, but NG+ is when DS2 really shines. Plus, the DLC is excellent. DS3 doesn’t bring anything new to the table. Nothing. It’s possibly the laziest game in the series. From shamelessly milks fans by offering Dark Souls 1 version 1.5 instead of a refreshing sequel. I’m upset by the artificial difficulties culminating from lazy development and rushed testing. I also hate that From dumped on PC gamers once again. PC modders resuscitated the franchise after fixing DS1, and they're rewarded by a crappy PC port. From has set the bar so low, I’m passing on its next release.…",6,2016-06-15,PC,user

It's great fun, with a lot of mystery and the typical humor. Like in it's predecessors the combat is very tense and tactical. It's paced up a little though and that's a good thing. When I start up Dark Souls II now, it feels unnaturally slow. Gameplay wise DS III improves the formula a lot. Visuals are very good and the art design is downright fantastic as always. Multiplayer is great, both cooperatively (praise the sun!) and player versus player. I like the environments a little bit less than in Dark Souls and Dark Souls II. The equipment, lore and gameplay however have improved much and make up for the environments. The game and it's bossfights (with a few notable exceptions) feel a little easier than earlier titles (which is not necessarily bad). The fight with the Nameless King is an amazing addition to the series and brilliant for multiplayer cooperation. Just like the other two, this is designed to be played with a 360 or XOne controller and the use of one is almost indispensable. All in all I'd rate it a 9,2/10.",9,2016-05-31,PC,user

The PVP option the enemies in a players world should always attack both players not require a seed of giant tree. The lack of master key like dark souls 1 and the general connection of worlds still makes this seem subpar to the classic dark souls 1.",9,2016-05-30,PC,user
Vigilem,"Compared to the previous games, they've made areas easier but boss fights harder. With bosses having more multi-hit moves than before to compensate for the players being better than before. That said, there's a few gimmick fights that are no challenge at all when you figure it out. Not too fond of this change. I also don't like they've done away with the spell castings and implemented the FP system. So all in all I find the combat and difficulty is a little underwhelming. But just about everything else is brilliant. Its an excellent conclusion to the series. Plot, lore, characters, its all really good and culminates everything from Dark Souls 1 (very little reference to Dark Souls 2).",9,2016-05-30,PC,user

Micalica,"Short: If you played and enjoyed Dark Souls 1, this is the game for you. Buy it right now. Worth full price. Long: Dark Souls 3 takes its own path and runs full-speed ahead with it. You either keep pace or stumble, fall, and meet it at the finish line. Its sheer attention to detail and mastery of scenery will make you stare at a single room or entire area for several minutes straight. That stray bit of wood, loose tiles cascading into a hole in a wall, rubble forming an eye-grab, alerting the player to the next path they take. Some areas genuinely took my breath away, while others fell flat. Those that stand out are true, outstanding works of art. Incredible. Weapons are interesting. Access to soul-weaponry pretty early compared to Dark Souls 2, and without the considerable resources required in Dark Souls 1; a nice sweet spot. However, the upgrade materials are seemingly miles away, and if a player misses an item(s) at a certain point, it's an arduous trek to pick it up later. Their balancing is weird. For instance, the Broadsword does nearly the same damage as a greatsword, and attacks far faster. Multiplayer needs work but is functional and easily understood. But, the weapons feel like they have real weight to them this time. Not a flimsy piece of metal that dents upon hitting stone once, but a real tool for the character to put to work; for myself, the Axes were the most satisfying. The weapon arts are cool but too far and redundant to really make a huge mark on gameplay. Leveling is great too. It's less of a chore than in Dark Souls 2, and it feels less punishing than Dark Souls 1, due to the results gained by leveling up, where as in the latter it took considerable leveling to get the desired effect. Or, it felt less profound. There are areas you can farm for souls and it isn't slave labor like in Dark Souls 1, but is (as with the aforementioned areas) not so easy as Dark Souls 2. The Bosses are similar to Dark Souls 1 in their lack of diversity, creativity, yet the outstanding performances of a select few in comparison. Recycled bosses return to the Dark Souls series, much to my dismay. They're obvious, poorly executed, and disappointing. The ""I'm you, but stronger"" meme is very relevant to this point. Multiple enemy bosses return, to nobody's pleasure. Very lame. Gimmick bosses make a very unfortunate reappearance in Dark Souls 3 as well, but, at least they're kind of cool. They're not impossible to figure out, and in retrospect, are interesting ideas. Not too glaring, not great. However, certain bosses are amazing and memorable, and incredibly satisfying to the player. Perhaps the so-so bosses exist only as a comparison, in order to put the great bosses on an even higher pedestal. If so, it's a phenomenal strategy, From. The story has multiple sidequests and characters much like the prior games, each interesting and complex to carry out. Its actual main story aligns very similarly to Dark Souls 1 in lore, and Dark Souls 2 execution. Bonfire girl for level ups and guidance, but she has an agenda, and very little information is given to you outside of item descriptions etc. The drawbacks of the game: Enemy variety. A hollow humanoid with a sword/axe/spear, a smaller humanoid that attacks from stealth/areas unseen with quick movements. A hollow that attacks from a distance with fire. A hollow that attacks with great power, but has a small health pool. A powerful armored hollow that is really cool but a bastard to kill early on. These are the types of enemies that occur most often in the game. In Dark Souls 1 (and 2) each area has unique, defining enemy types. Some repeat but for the most part they're consistent with themselves. In Dark Souls 3 they've been smeared across the whole game, with far more rampant recycling. (including bosses) Enemy placement is by far the most annoying part of the game. The first four hours of gameplay are interesting, exciting, and definitely engaging. However, you begin to notice a terrible pattern emerging. Hallway? Enemies next to the doorway. Item? Enemies above or next to it. Lever? Enemies above or waiting to vault over something. Necessary path ahead? Enemy blocking it. Large open space? Many enemies at range and a few melee. Dark area? Enemies above, behind, nearby. Ambushes seem to be the only tactic that FromSoft implemented in enemy placement in Dark Souls 3. No real interesting or varied concepts, just ""Let's have them get attacked from all sides again."" Very predictable. Armor is very lackluster. Poise is ""working as intended"" which FromSoft appears to believe as its complete non-existence. Wearing all but the Havel Set will make you staggered from a regular enemy hit, whereas in the previous Souls games, armor actually had its purpose in reducing damage and preventing staggering. Upgrading is a waste of materials and souls, seeing as there's no point. - Despite those, the game is great.",9,2016-05-28,PC,user

The feeling, when you finally kill a boss is overwhelming and all in all it gives you as a gamer the feeling to have something achieved. Furthermore I love the graphics that gives the game a true creepy feeling that corresponds perfect with the atmosphere and the gamestyle. Your heartbeat goes like 220 when you meet a boss for the first time and your whole body is shaking when the boss falls down.

Swagalf,"First of all please do yourself a favor and : - Play with a controller (whine whine controls are bad for mouse and keyboard... please.. some games are designed for k&m, other for controller.) - Play Dark Souls 1 and 2. Yes, that's a trilogy. You won't read or watch the last LotR part without the others, that's a nonsense too for the Souls series. Oh and make search about lore if you are interested by it. Now, let's take a look at some bad reviews : -There's no lore ! -> Seriously .. ? Wow. Please go on youtube or just google Dark Soul lore. There's plenty of video, thread and wiki just about the lore, debating, thinking about every clue and every detail. But yeah, Dark Souls is one of the series that use the fact that it's a video game to have a different story telling.. ennemie placement, level design, loot placement, design detail and item description, that's where the lore is. No you won't have a wall of text or a cinematic that tell you everything you need to know because it tell you the same thing with a way that only video game can use. Experimentation, research and care of detail. -Other series would have bad note if they do the same thing over and over again ! That's the same as Dark Souls X -> Mario, Street Fighter, GTA, Elder's scroll, Zelda, Fallout ... do I need to go on ? Every series do the same things. So please.. don't use that argument. It just make no sens. -lol Dark easy Souls ! It's way more easier than [insert a soulsborne game here] ! git gud ! -> It may be easier in some way yes. But do you understand that you maybe play 40+ hours in a precedent game of the series ? And a player who have some hours of play in Street Fighter / CS / [insert franchise here] will learn the mechanics and won't struggle as much as the first experience in the franchise ? Please... please... - Poise is absent -> Yes, that can be a bad point. I understand. Always played light and agile build but yup, I understand - It just crash and crash and crash -> Yeah.. never have the problem without a average pc but yes, some card, spec or idk just don't like this game.. but there's some way to avoid it, just search for them.. and I don't know if crash are still present. But yeah, I feel sorry for you. Now, my review : The first half of the game is good, but not as good as I excepted, there's some good surprise and **** but.. the hype was too present I guess. But god, that second half though ! I won't spoil but it's really, really, really good. **** feeling, epic boss fight.... wow. Wow. WOW. This game really have the ""it's the end"" feeling, that's incredible. Feelings are here, happiness, sadness, doubt... In term of level design, I rate it between Dark Souls 1 and Dark Souls 2 (Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 3, Dark Souls 2) but lorewise, it make sense, you will understand it. So... yup. Why not ? (please don't tell me the lore is here because they don't know how to make a good level design....). On top of that, I think that the level design of Dark Souls 1 seems so good because fire teleportation come late and you have experience the world just so many time for getting back to Firelink shrime that you learned it and saw the connection. I really feel that Dark Souls 2 and Dark Souls 3 fire teleport at start isn't good. Bossfights : OH YEAH ! Welcome back monsters, it feel good to see you again after Dark Souls 2. Chara-design : Yup. Yup. and yup again. They are interesting and well design. Maybe they are too kind but we aren't a random hollow like the others game we are an Unkindled and we have their respect for that. Lore : Aaaaahhh... so much answers.. so much question. Once again, it's just fascinating. This game is good. Really, really good. It's just fascinating to see the world and experience it. Fight feeling is once again great. Like the others Souls game, you need to like this kind of game to enjoy it but... who play Civ and say it's trash if they don't like turn-based strategy game ? Yeah, Dark Souls 3 isn't perfect and I wanted to rate it 9.3 but .. 9 is fair. This is the souls I've been waiting for a conclusion. And once again, thanks From Software. The Souls games are one of the purest video game ever made. Everything is around game design and every way of telling you this or making you use that is design like that because game can use these mechanics. Film or book can't. Play Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 2, Dark Souls 3 be curious about lore and enjoy them. Those game are incredible experience and if you really are interested about what a video game can be, play them and think about them, think about every mechanic, every story telling details and every way they use to tell you the lore.",9,2016-05-22,PC,user
desoul,"I am a fan of the series (i have to state that before I begin) The good: -graphics -design -music -atmosphere -weapons -lore -NPCs -Bosses -online is great and fast The bad: -worlds feel small -mobs arent as challenging as previous games -badly made leveling up system (poise is pointless) -not much you can do with builds (feel free to correct me on this one) -armor not that great (design wise as well, I felt the previous games were better) -some questlines are unrewarding and almost all questlines end halfway through the game (this could be a good thing) a bit spoilery here Summary: I loved the atmosphere of the game, and I also really liked the questlines for the npcs, as well as how unique each npc was (I didnt like the npcs in dark souls2 as much, best so far were in demons); I like how they all gathered the same way they gathered in the nexus The bosses were cool (in dark souls 2 the bosses were bland, but in all others the bosses were epic). What I didnt like is how quickly a world ends, and how all over the place the game was. Demons had worlds (which I liked), dark souls 1 had amazing level designs where you felt that everything was connected and you felt satisfied when you found a shortcut. Dark souls2 level design wasnt as good but atleast the levels were big. Dark souls 3 levels are really small compared to the series (or atleast this is how i felt), and the levels dont seem to be that connected, it relies too much on the bonfire. The leveling up in this game was strange, which is paired with the combat, my main issue is splitting the leveling up points into way too many categories, and that poise means nothing. Increase your poise as much as you want, wear the heaviest armor and you will still get staggered by a tiny sword from its first hit. The FP system was a nice introduction, but it was really shallow, weapons lacked a bit of depth (bloodborne spoiled me with that one). Also, I noticed that some halberds (classified as halberds) had the same/similar move set to spears :/ The online system was the best in this game though, really connects quickly (ignoring the stupid dark moon grinding)",7,2016-05-22,PC,user

Soul memory has been adjust so you can play with a friend without worrying about it.

There are constants cameos to the souls series as you can obtain any armour from the series.

Derf3L,"Playing Dark Souls 3 has been a pleasant experience. Everything is improved compared to the previous DS games, the graphics are pretty cool and the areas are nice. Having finished all games in the series (except for Bloodborne), I found it smooth and enjoyable, with less annoying areas than the predecessors. The world design is pretty good, but seems a bit linear. There are connections and shortcuts throughout the game, but the path is still one and you gotta follow it to progress through the game. The ability to teleport from each bonfire is also a proof of the linearity, since it would take ages to move from an area to the other, just by running. In the end, it feels like there isn't much difference from previous DS games, the core mechanics are the same, same atmosphere, lack of storyline/lore (mostly hidden in items descriptions).

Which would be fine if the main character was faster just like Bloodborne but nope he moves,dodges, and attacks like a turtle with its legs chopped off.Poise is also nonexistent and the enemies do ridiculous amounts of damage even by the standards of the souls series no matter which armor you wear or how much vigor you have making tank builds impossible.Same with stamina which gets annihilated by the crazy combos of the enemies unless you have a greatshield (and even that wont help you sometimes) People hated how Dark souls 2 handled difficulty by spamming enemies even though Dark souls 3 does the same thing and even worse since fighting at least 2-3 enemies at the same time is the norm in early areas and 4-5 in later.Optimization is also bad with fps drops,stuttering,and crashes even on high end rigs.There are many more problems (like the unbalanced sorcery,faith builds,pvp) but overall this is a poor excuse of a souls game unlike the fantastic Dark souls 1 which handled difficulty way better,fortunately those things can be worked out with patches but the chance of From doing it is very low.",0,2016-05-12,PC,user

MrMe43,"I have been playing Dark Souls since the original (never really got into demon souls) and I truly did enjoy the first two games in the Dark Souls franchise. I cant really find anything wrong with PVE, although it seems easier than the others, but the PVP is where the game is severely lacking. The biggest issue is the lack of poise alongside the insane stability of great shields . I don't know when they are going to fix this but currently pose does nothing, one hit from any weapon and you will stagger no matter the armor or rings. The result of this is the spamming of straight swords with great shields and full heavy armor. It takes the fun out of PVP. Unless you do the same, these scrubs will stun lock you from one lucky hit and sit behind a shield until they start spamming 10 swings at a time again. I can win matches if I pull out a straight sword, but I believe it just ruins what made this amazing co-op, PVP system so great to begin with. I don't know why they did this but I am very disappointed. The PVE, while extremely fun and somewhat challenging (the first couple times), can only be amusing for a certain amount of time before it becomes mundane. If you are not a fan of PVP or don't aim for it, Dark Souls 3 is a extremely worthwhile buy, but the multiplayer is extremely biased towards one play style and it is exponentially more frustrating than single player. And some might not find this a problem and will just stick with the same spam style to keep pace with the rest of the masses, but if you are looking for a diverse group of players to challenge you online, you will be extremely disappointed until they fix this system. My score is harsh only to show my frustration.",4,2016-05-11,PC,user
DemonSoul,"The thrill is mostly the same, which is a good thing. However the improvements are minimal. 1. The stage design is extremely linear, with many dead ends leaving you feeling dissatisfied. Gone is the fluid stage design in part one that linked the world together in a way that left you in awe. 2. The hub from demon's souls is back and that bring a welcome and homely feel. 3. The resistances do not have logic. Like fire resistance linked to strength, and vigor linked to frost etc... Logic satisfies players through suspension of disbelief. 4. They should have added more stats and made more ways of play available. for instances power a stat like stability can definitely change how you play the game, or weapon knowledge can increase the amount of techniques to a weapon. A thief should be much more like a thief from dungeons & dragons, with stealth movement, and powerful counters and back stabs, surprise attacks. maybe not even a great PvE Character. as well, a mage should be more unique. 5. Researched a few more moves on the sword combinations. These techniques are not hard to find. I find some of the combinations like for the straight sword too basic. The could even have added one or two more stances, perhaps a strong defensive stance, and an extremely mobile one that alllows for faster attacks. 6. they could have added a ""throw"" or disarm technique for when you get in close 6. The could have had different degrees of backstabs depending on how well you sneak up and your angle of attack, but instead its the same recycled back stab animation. At least in Demon's souls's there was a legitimate sword technique used in the back stab even if it wasn't the prettiest one. 7. The magic is way to simple and could definitely take notes from world of warcraft for mage spells. Imagine having blink and frost nova. I understand they were afraid to make mages powerful, but this is dark souls THREE, at this point it is time to take it to the next level and with enough careful design and balance they could have made an amazing game for magic users too. If anything fire, lightning, magic resistances should have been related to a magic, intellect, or resistances stat, or both. 8. I'm not feeling the focus points and when other players seem to use them in PvP they seem to be soo vulnerable and easy to hurt.. 9. Poison is annoying. It doesn't make sense that a guy hitting your shield poisons you. At this point I am just finishing the road of sacrifices. I will return to update this review.",7,2016-05-11,PC,user
TsukasaHiiragi,"Bugs, cut content - horrible community and the PC version suffers from a MAJOR hacker problem. Exactly, I could write a huge review here and mirror what all the other people have said - its not going to matter much because there are far too many fanboi posts or employee posts boosting positives. My personal problem with the DS series as a whole, is the game isn't difficult - its cheap, there is a difference. If your going to make a game thats brutally unfair, then the physics and execution of the game needs to be perfect and none of the DS series has managed that so far. If you want a perfectly structured review, then read Dhelio's review since that more or less is spot on.",2,2016-05-11,PC,user
camptownrangers,"I didn't even think it was possible for a Souls game to be any better than Bloodborne, but here I am. From the beginning it only ever gets better, with some of the series' most climactic and amazing bosses.",10,2016-05-11,PC,user
luzarius,"I love the art direction, story, music, voice acting and combat system. The only problem is the level of difficulty. You can never just relax and enjoy yourself. I would give this game a solid nine, but I'm giving it a 5 due to lack of difficulty setting.

Dhelio,"People are giving this game incredible votes only because of its legacy; but it is far from perfect. DK3 suffers problems that its predecessors didn't have, nor does any game with a decent development time behind. Poise is a deactivated stat, which influences nothing (as confirmed to me by Bandai Namco technical assitance), causing you to get staggered by any enemy, even if you're wearing heavy armor, thus making heavy armor useless. This bug is even more unbearable given how every enemy is relentless in attacking you, making stunlock deaths the norm just because the enemy (be that a player or a mob) managed to connect a single hit. Combat is also heavily influeced by Bloodborne, focusing in fast attacks and dodging and flashy movesets...while you wear armor. Yeah, you can see for yourself why this is **** DK3 combat is way faster than DK1. And that is really not what DK is about. Late game level design is also terrible. There are whole shortcuts that are never used, because once you've unlocked them there is no enemy to defeat, just bonfires. And the bonfires themselves are placed really badly, with multiple occurences of bonfires distant just a room from each other. Whole areas consist in just a single room filled to the brim with enemies, without shortcuts nor buildup to the boss (Profaned Capital, Consumed King's Garden and a late game level I don't feel like spoiling). And the enemy placement and variety PLUMMETS in the second half, with occurences of invisible enemies that are placed there only to corner you in a blind spot (that is so consistent with the game design THAT IT ONLY **** HAPPENS ONCE). It has now been discovered, as I write, that phantom range in straight swords are rapiers is a thing, making them SIGNIFICANTLY longer that Ultra Great Swords and Great Swords which, given the increased speed and damage of straight swords, makes using them the only viable options for PvP and make the life everyone that does PvE with any weapon other than straight swords significantly harder. The bosses themselves don't follow the same rules, with some who have attacks that are literally instakills (Dancer and Lothric in particular), so fast that players barely have time to dodge . Performance is also an issue, with early areas that run smooth as butter and lategame areas that have unbearable FPS drops when looking at distant geometry. Input delay is also a problem, with multiple times I've died because the game thought that rolling after I've pressed the button more than 3 seconds Before was a good idea. -------------------- Dark Souls 3 is not a perfect game. As it stands, it is not even a good game. Between bugs, cut content and rushed features, DK3 is a relevant step back from its predecessors, and not a masterpieces it should rightfully be. Maybe DLCs will fix that, maybe not. But as it stands, the only thing DK3 does right is atmosphere and music.",4,2016-05-11,PC,user
Sentient,"Folks who gave this a 10... i want some of what you are smoking. After playing through the game with a friend of mine who is also a huge souls series fan, we both came to the same conclusion; Dissapointment. While a good game, it just falls short in several areas and brings very little new to the table. Im a long time souls fan and have done multiple play-throughs of each title. This is by far the least polished game in the series. not only were there bugs at launch but framerate problems have persisted even after the first couple updates. But my main gripes with this game are as follows: the bonfire placement was more frequent; making them more like checkpoints than the much loved sanctuary in the previous games. Many areas and bosses alike were just so heavily inspired by previous games that only a couple areas felt totally fresh. In the end, i wish From Software had really made a more compelling send off to the dark souls series.",6,2016-05-10,PC,user
Majestic,"A really good finale to the series. It's got some of the most immersive and graphically impressive enviroments. The art design and sound are top notch. Enemy variety is well done, and the bosses are no longer all ""dudes in armor"". There is definitely more emphasis on learning the patterns of bosses this time around. If you're melee, it can sometimes be a bit frustrating to learn all of the telegraphs and time the corresponding roll. But it's all the more satisfying to be honest, because it was far too easy in previous games to just deck out with mass poise and a greatshield and cheese every boss. Another annoyance is how they continued Dark Souls 2 way of handling NPC's. And how most of them require little convincing to join you and remain in firelink for the majority of the time. Playing the ATM machine for the player's convenience. That was definitely better in DS1, where NPC's left Firelink at some point. It does however require a beefy system to get it to stick to 60fps. And especially on the CPU side. You'll have no qualms with an overclocked i5 and a GTX 970 / 980. But you will have issues with AMD FX CPU's and Radeon Graphics cards. Since those cards have more CPU overhead in the drivers, compounding the issue. I will be playing this again and again. And to all the whiny **** giving it a 1-4 because they can't appreciate having to put effort into a game, git gud. I will give it 9/10, for fromsoftware not really ironing out the performance (though personally I was able to play it flawlessly), some slight overuse of emphasis on rolling and the handling of NPC's. They are minor complaints, hence I'm not detracting much more.",9,2016-05-10,PC,user
woNd3R,"Unfortunately Dark Souls 3 has lost its freshness. In particular this game is way too easy, is very short and enemies are easily predictable. If you don't play online there is no sense of a new game + . This is the fourth chapter and there is nothing really that adds replay value (item hunt for example , new weapons). The rpg elements of the game could have been better on the 4th installment. I like getting new things as i progress but at the end i finished the game with the same weapon i started it. Armor sets are kinda useless and are only usefull for the looks. Story is always the same thing, the Undead hero that will become the lord of Cinders etc etc, nothing new. Also the environment is way too similar to the previous souls chapters, seems to me very copy pasted. I think the biggest problem is that it doesn't add anything new at all. Only proper dual wielding weapons , the rest has been seen before. All in all it's a good game and that means 8/10 but we are very far away from a 10/10",8,2016-05-10,PC,user
Rumblefish,"The final installment in the Souls series would be the best yet were it not for some technical issues. FromSoft have borrowed the best aspects of the three previous games and also Bloodborne to produce a ""greatest hits"" version of the game. The graphics, models and environments are more beautiful than ever. There have been many improvements to the gameplay too. Weapon scaling is more evenly spread and can be infused with different gems which will tailor them to your character build. For example, if your character has low stats use Raw to give the weapon a boost which avoids the player stats. If you are high in strength but have a high dexterity weapon, just infuse the weapon with Heavy and it will now use strength to scale instead of dexterity. Maybe you've rolled a Faith build and can't use conventional weapons, simply infuse with Blessed or Lightning to have the weapon scale from the Faith. This innovation really opens up the game's whole arsenal to all players. Magic, miracles and pyromancy have all been massivlely improved with two simple additions. Instead of the unwieldy method that was previously used where a spellcaster would need to equip a number of casts only for them to be impotent after this allotment is exhausted, DSIII features what is basically a mana pool, ie Focus. This is paired with a new type of estus flask which refills the Focus bar when ****. Furthermore, you can choose at any time how to allocated your estus flasks between those that will refill HP and those that restore Focus. Great! Additionally, DSIII features weapons arts/skills which are essentially special moves which cost Focus. Every weapon, shield, talisman and catalyst benefit from a particular weapon art. These range from increasing poise, to spinning sword attacks, to spellpower boosts. All of the above adds to the viability of any and all playstyles, including a hybrid build. These are the best systems employed in a Souls game. Armour sets can no longer be upgraded but this is a sensible change. Again it encourages the use of various kit rather than having to stick with the one set you've sunk all of your materials into. Anyway, there are so many armour sets to choose from here, over 80 beautifully rendered outfits. It's impossible to get bored trying them all out. All of the best and fan favourite armours from DSI and II are here. The same can also be said for the rings, weapons and spells. If you have a favourite from the previous games then it'll be in DSIII and better than ever and you may even find a new favourite amongst the new additions. The bosses are inventive and memorable and brutally difficult, as you'd expect. The NPCs are full of character and offer oblique, unsettling dialogue in true souls-style. This all helps to build an intriguing and opaque storyline as you flounder through the lands of the strange but oddly familiar lands. Other notable features include new emotes, a revamped covenant system, improvements to online play. However, currently DSIII is let down by a few technical errors and oversights. I have died hundreds of times already but 80% of these deaths seems to come from one of two methods. Either the camera lock breaks and spins my character so my back is to the enemy (goodnight), or I am trapped between an enemy and a piece of scenery with no way of rolling away. Either type of death is frustrating and unnecessary and marrs the experience of the game. Also, poise is not active in the game to date, making a mockery of all those heavy armours you may have invested in. Lastly, the net code is pretty awful. I am regularly kicked out of the game because the server has lost its connection with Steam and online pvp is currently a joke as characters lage by over a second on the screen making any battle a flailing mess, both antagonists hitting only clean air as they swing for the enemy that is apparently stood next to them but isn't. Magic is also utterly useless in pvp as spells take an age to cast, can't be cancelled out of, and are easily dodged. Lastly, some of the hitboxes are all over the place. Fight a huge dog beast thing that or a Mimic and they are likely to pick you up and chomp you to death despite the fact you were nowhere near them at the time. These poor aspects of the game detract a little but overall Dark Souls 3 is an outstanding achievement and a wonderful blend of all the best aspects of this great series with some welcome refinements. A must buy. 9/10",9,2016-05-09,PC,user
Fuz,"Game is great. Has some really amazing maps, interesting enemies, great encounters and an amazing art direction. Too bad bosses are beautiful and interesting but you are forced to roll: you can't block even with 40 stamina or you'll basically get stunlocked, if you roll while blocking an attack you roll after the block ending up in the next swing (WHY?), and the camera is often TERRIBLE and will cost you many deaths (hello, King of Storms). For someone who always played a heavy warrior this whole business about shields and rolling is absolutely HORRIBLE. Terrible gameplay design on this. Why change something that worked so well? Slow weapons have been mistreated too, they don't do enough damage to compensate the speed and the way they leave you open to blows. In DS1 when I died I always thogth ""I'm an idiot"" or ""I shouldn't do that"" and never blamed the game because it was always fair, and this was fantastic and gave a great feeling of overcoming something, here's - thanks to that stupid design mechanics - doesn't really happen. Game is not as fair as DS1, at all. Also it's way more linear than DS1 and the maps aren't as beautifully connected as in that. A bit too much fanservice too. But nothing major.

The fresnel visual effect is still in this game and for anyone who hates this we find ourselves plagued by it again, like cheap instagram photo-filters. Another key drawback is that the RPG element is lacking again, in contradiction to RPG sites that promote it. As it's still squarely in the Third Person Action genre button masher. The Japanese studio has escaped very critical condemnation for both elements and should have rightfully been charged with failing on both. The industry should hang it's head in shame for misrepresenting the game as an RPG and overuse of cheesy 3d effects.

nomaddc,"Regulation 1.06 was announced to be released on April 28, and it was to fix some serious Online issues. But in reality it never arrived, but what's even worse - Bandai Namco didn't release any official statement on why Regulations didn't arrive and when they will, as well as there is complete silence on this subject on Dark Souls twitter or in steam news/announcements/community. It's already May 6, and official Dark Souls channels are behaving like if nothing happened at all. Patch did arrive on consoles though, but not PC. That and the fact that game is still laggy on high-end rigs, drops frames, has gameplay issues (try look up ""Poise Dark Souls 3"" or ""Darkmoon blades wait time PC"") that need to be addressed, really ambiguous patch notes in past (instead of being precise on what was fixed or changed, they just roll with ""graphics were adjusted"" or ""Long sword damage was tuned"". And that's not touching biggest part - combat. Many unique weapons from previous games made it, but their movesets are now complete garbage, there are about 2 variation of moveset across whole weapon classes, many unique and cool movesets are gone, the final boss soul weapon is absolutely disappointing as it is pretty much a reskin of very basic weapon that can be obtained rather early in the game with minor change (weapon art, which is also extremely disappointing). Overall weapons are bland and boring, Twinblade weapon class is gone, some categories have only 3 weapons (while in previous games it was more, and weapons were more unique). Because of all this my score is 0/10. Once we get some official statement on Regulation 1.06 (and apology to Dark Souls community), Blue Sentinels and Darkmoon blades covenants fixed, and at least get rid of random fps drops on hi-end PCs - I will reconsider this score.

PizzaSHARK,"It's an okay game, but it's not the 10/10 game the fanboys are calling it. There are a frankly immense number of flaws that, considering it's their fifth game in the series, aren't really forgivable. The camera still **** and makes many boss fights far harder than they should be. There are still severe issues with hitbox lag and hitboxes being wider than they appear (primarily on grab attacks, like always.) Poise, a mechanic the game is quite clearly designed around, was shipped turned off in the game's configuration files and has yet to be turned back on, nor has From Software released a statement explaining why such a crucial gameplay element was disabled for launch. There are some extremely severe balance issues, too. More than is reasonable for the fifth game in a series, but no game releases in a perfect state. From Software seems to be rather slow in identifying and remedying the problems, however, and in fact actually nerfed some gameplay elements that were already performing far below other playstyles. There are also innocent players getting hit with bans because players using cheats (via Cheat Engine, a well-known and well-documented process editing tool that From Software should be well aware of by this point) are able to modify their stats simply by attacking them. Happened to me tonight, on a fresh character. From Software's advice? Back up your saves and revert to them if you're affected by a hacker. Yup, that means you lose all progress on all characters since the last time you made a backup, and you can't back up the files without exiting the game. This is, honestly, not acceptable and really shows just how little they know about the PC format, despite going to great lengths with both Dark Souls 2 and now Dark Souls 3 to court them. Maybe they should've used some of that multimillion dollar budget on hiring or contracting some people who actually understand the PC format. In spite of the basket full of severe flaws and a goddamned trainload of minor flaws, it's still a decent product. A bit better than average. I originally planned on giving it a 7, but after making one last-ditch attempt to have fun with the game after beating it the first time, I fought Dancer of the Boreal Valley and that boss fight is so horribly designed and has so many obvious problems that will never be addressed that I decided a 7/10 was being a little too generous. If you're expecting this to be the crown jewel of the Soulsborne series... man, I'm sorry but you're in for a lot of disappointment. While the production values and aesthetics knock it out of the park, as far as gameplay goes it's barely any better than damned Lords of the Fallen, and has absolutely no chance of competing with Dark Souls or Dark Souls 2.

danstew,"This game performs rather well on my system (i7-4790, 16 gigs of RAM, Windows 7, GTX 960 with 4 gigs). There are some random quick frame-drops, but nothing game-breaking (not making fights harder) and not happening too often. Now, if you played and liked the previous DS-games, you will feel right at home, as the controls are set up pretty much the same way. One difference you WILL feel is that the fights are bit faster-paced, kinda like showing a little Bloodbourne-influence regarding speed. I disagree to the reviews I saw that said ""This is not for casual gamers"". I am such a casual gamer, really... I did play the first DS back when it came out, but these days, I hardly have enough time to sink any serious time into a game due to my job. I was intimidated by the thought of trying out DS3, as I remembered how tough DS1 could be. However, I think I am doing ok right now. I am only playing for small periods of time, and am making slow, yet steady progress. The first few bosses weren't all too challenging, yet I know this will change eventually. Actually, I found the trash to be more difficult than the bosses. Some of them (knights with lances and shield, casting witches with grab-attack etc) do require quite some tactic and fast reactions. My advice: a) Take it slow, don't try to jump in and pull a group of mobs and waste them all. B) stay calm and get used to the system DS has: Dieing is a part of the game, a learning experience, something normal. Don't get angry, don't smash your controller... take a deep breath, use what you just learned before you died and get back to it. Controller is a good segue - you WILL need one. I am sure some guys play this with kbm, but the devs recommend a controller, and it does make sense. The controls take some time to get used to, but work well for fast-paced combat. Graphics and music do look really nice, and as usual, the lore and story isn't shoved into your face with tons of pointers and arrows and stuff... you need to go look for it and deduct what is going on. Pros: - Looks great - Decent performance - Great music - Nice controls - Atmosphere - Very challenging, but very rewarding Cons: - Some framerate issues sometimes on my system - Glitching-type things... enemies can and WILL hit you through walls and floors, which I think it NOT ok in a game relying so much on tactic, reaction time and fast combat. Using walls or doorways as a tactic won't work well if the NPCs are able to hit you through the wall with their lances. It's not game-breaking, but feels a bit unfair, kills immersion and it surprises me this actually even is existing. - Some issues with hacks and bans going on, and apparently, hackers found a way to get ""innocents"" banned, which ****.

psylife,"Despite the plethora of enemies and bosses on offer, this is a highly repetitive experience. Incredibly, you are not allowed to restart a boss fight, instead, the game will force you to run back from the last checkpoint over and over in a mind numbing cycle of frustration and despair ; This is a seldom seen time waster in games. This pathetic design choice is most likely there to artificially extend the game-play time. About 50% OF THE GAME-PLAY TIME had me run back to the boss fight location so as to get a shot at the actual challenge ; THIS IS NOT AN EXAGGERATION, you will fight bosses as much as you will run back to them. This design choice alone has me resent the developer profoundly. Past the built-in time wasters, the game is surprisingly not that challenging and the whole design structure encourages you to use exploits in conjunction with Exp grinds. The combat has plenty of nuance, yet it all comes down to rolling, slashing and dying until the end credits. The plethora of enemies on offer are fantastic to look at (as are the worlds), but ultimately fail to add a satisfying level of variety to the combat, as I said, this is very much a one note experience, roll, slash until you reach the end. Dark souls is fundamentally and structurally not a good game, and should be severely reprimanded for some of its design choices. There is something clearly addictive and the world design, lore and detailed visuals must be commended for there exceptional quality. The frame rate is all over the place and bugs abound. Unless you are a nerd with literally no life, or you simply can't resist the lore and visuals, I advise you stay away ; What is good and exceptional about this game cannot be reached other than through the sadistic prism of frustration and a massive amount of time waste.

Papaoso,"Played DS1, DS2, and now onto DS3. Hell, I even was an avid ""Demon Souls"" fan to back in the day. Sadly, this series has died with DS3. I once highly respected the Dark Souls franchise but after 100+ hours of Dark Souls 3, no longer. Not out of frustration, but out of disappointment. Simply put DS3 is far too linear for me to enjoy. If you miss a specific, concealed area you will be lost and stuck for far too long. Progression isn't obvious and frustrating not because of difficulty (the game is still difficult) but more importantly the game map design is terrible. In DS1 there was this lovely sense over the map being very inter-connected. DS2 moved away from that to make a more dull and linear layout, but DS3 takes this to a new level. It's really pathetic how little innovation, if any, went into making the game. It's a true disappointment. For those who still love the game because yes, it is still very pretty and the mechanics are the same from DS1&2 the game layout is overwhelmingly disappointing. Having finished my first play-through I am sincerely tempted to ask for my money back due to the lack of ingenuity behind this game design. It is pathetic. I tend to hold games to very high standards, but it is a sincere shame to see a game like DS (once held as my benchmark for great gaming) to fall to such a level. The sheer linear design of DS3 progression is disdainful. Anyone who was a dark souls fan should actively stay away from DS3. I never even began to talk about how poor the optimization is behind the game. It is really sad how poor the game preforms. Please stay away and wait a few months until the game has a 30%+ sale and/or they improve the performance of the game. DS3, if anyone from their staff reads this, please be ashamed of what you released. I feel embarrassed to see a franchise fall so far from where it once stood. Lacking innovation, making a ""cash cow"" product of what was once a respectable series, and insulting any DS fan with a garbage linear-design for its map leaves me to say simply I'm done.

Blaran,"So normally I would have given this game a 9/10 but I did 10/10 to balance out all the **** reviews. So I have put in around 80 hours of gameplay into this game and have experienced a few minor problems. So to start, the most complained about thing with this game that I see is ""IT DOESN'T WORK"" and honestly yes the PC port wasn't great for this game and it does crash every once in a while but to all those people who say its the most broken game in history I say look at Arkam Knight and its PC port. Yes the game crashes sometimes around bonfires, and there are a few connection errors but for me at least most of those can be blamed on my **** The game does drop in frame-rate a little when entering new areas of the game or encountering large mobs but other than that is is fairly stable. Another thing I saw a lot of is people complaining about the controls, yes the default PC controls **** in dark souls 3 but this can be fixed if you just remap them, or you can just plug in a controller like most people. Ok now on to the gameplay. I have seen a lot of 0s given to this game because people are butthurt that it is difficult, when this is one of the main selling points of dark souls so if you want a halo 5 campaign cake walk game then don't buy this game. While the graphics are not stunning they are good and do serve the purpose that they are meant to. The world size is fairly large and the areas are absolutely incredible even though they don't flow together as well as dark souls 1 areas did. The combat is clean and the mechanics are smooth making the game a delight to play. The bosses are varied in power and ability and are as always difficult and original. The weapon and armor selection is really well done and holds a lot of unique sets and pieces. The magic is pretty bland and boring though. Really the only complaints I have with this game is other than a few bugs the game felt a little short. I was able to finish the game in around 60 hours and I took my time and did EVERYTHING. Me NG+ run took only about 20 hours so thee is a bit of a power balance needed there. But over all the game just felt a little bit lacking in bosses and areas. Even with all the optional areas and bosses it still fell short of the amount of content the first 2 games had, and with no DLC coming anytime soon this is a bit disappointing. But even with the slight lack of bosses and areas there is still a lot of game here. Now if you are looking for a game with an incredible story line and character development then this is the wrong place to be looking. The story is weak if you can even call it existent. While the story is not great the lore found through item descriptions, bosses and areas is really good. There is a very well developed world hidden beneath a pile of item descriptions and what not. The last thing I am going to say is that a lot of people have been saying that dark sous is bad because it is the same game re-released, but the 3 souls games are at their core very much the same, games like call of duty are more similar to their predecessor than this. Also if you thing you will be able to buy your way to victory, then sorry you can't because this game has no micro-transactions. I hope this ridiculously long review was helpful.",10,2016-04-28,PC,user
gssbcvegancat,"This is the worst incarnation of a Souls game imaginable. It borrows bosses, and mechanics, from Demon Souls/Dark Souls 1. It doesn't improve on them, in fact it is just the opposite. A great example is the ""poise"" system from DS1. Poise is in this game, but only in name. It appears on armor, and even in item abilities, however it has no effect on the game. This means that any fast attacking enemy can stun lock the player to death, completely negating your armor. The poise issue only further shows another fault in the game. Enemies have been changed from previous games. Fast attacking enemies no longer have stamina, instead they have an infinite amount of stamina and their attacks are based on a roughly static ""attack per second"". While this means that one versus one you can easily beat them, it also means that if there are more than one the player has a much higher chance of getting killed. This isn't a case of ""getting better"", because there is no poise the player will now get stunned as soon as they are hit the first time/or their stamina is drained if they block. If all things were equal it would still be annoying, however enemies in the game do have poise. It is removed from the player, while enemies get full ""hyper armor"". This means that the player may try to swing that big axe like the npc, but if they get hit they get stunned out of their attack unless it happens in a few frames of hyper armor. Big weapons with wide swing arcs are generally used to kill lots of weak things fast, but that won't work anymore. That is just two of the problems with the basic attacks. IF you look at magic you will see other problems. For example scaling in the game is broken. Not in a positive way, but in a completely nonexistent way. Further if you do reach the 50+ area where magic actually starts to deal damage, you will have the exact same outfit as everyone else who is magic. You might ask, why? Fashion souls is the real end game, right? Not when it comes to magic, because in order to be viable you need a specific setup. You need a certain head piece, a certain dagger, your rings etc are all set. There is no variety because of how the system is designed. Instead of just making enemies hard, they have coded in artificial forms of increasing the difficulty. FOr example some enemies are coded to have a shield and face you all of the time. If you try to kick the shield then the game lowers the shield and counter attacks. However unlike DS/DS1 in this game you become animation locked far more frequently. An easily observed example is to start running, and then try to turn another direction. In DS your character would simply move, but in DS3 you get locked into a pivot animation. There are no iframes for this, and it counts as a counter hit giving the enemy bonus damage. So if you try to kick the shield the enemy is programmed to drop their shield and counter attack while you are unable to do anything. That isn't about skill, that is the complete opposite of what DS stands for. That is taking the ability to make the play from the player, and instead asking them if they can cheese the system like a speed runner. This can be observed when fighting knights past the dragon barracks also. They have a lock on feature that will lock on and hit you through walls, or invisibility. Despite having never actually observed the player they are capable of buffing then executing an attack on an invisible silenced enemy. I could go on, but this game isn't that worth it. It gets good ratings from people that never played the first ones. This is just a pale, pathetic, imitation of far better games. The only reason it's getting 3 stars instead of 2 is because of the clothing options available. They did a better, if still racist, job.",2,2016-04-28,PC,user
PinpointLearner,"Finally I can write a good review of this game. It seems the crashing issues are solved by this moment, all classes are eligible and bonfires are not the most dangerous enemy in Lothric. Undoubtedly, this is the best game of the Dark Souls saga, I'll explain myself. Almost every negative reviews are telling us about crashes or just hate because this isn't a game for all people. Away of that, who liked the game has marked it with a 8 or higher. Gameplay: so faster than before, with many Bloodborne features which can be seen in enemies and their behaviour, movesets and other actions like rolling, healling, etc. Graphics: just amazing. Dark Souls has never been notorious because of its graphics. However, this is the new generation and, although some zones are not polished, the average is a pretty game that will make you astonished. Maps: fully interconnected, even more that in DS1. Weapons: new weapon arts are amazing! As I said before, movesets are more dynamic and enemies are a full-time threat. OST... no words to describe that. And finally, LORE are so oriented to end stories of Dark Souls, and that's nice for old players.",10,2016-04-28,PC,user
PutCashIn,"Having been pleasantly surprised with the console port of Dark Souls 2, I am amazed at the incredible lack of foresight and early game decisions made for Dark Souls 3. There is a boss character in the TUTORIAL area, almost making Deprived characters impossible to play, especially on PC, with the as ever present in a Dark Souls game amazingly bad camera aiming and lack of any meaningful block and parry. In Dark Souls 2 you could start deprived, find a dagger, make your way to the Hub, level up, invest in your character and actually do some ROLE PLAYING GAME gaming. In Dark Souls 3, you are essentially forced into one of the Character builds given at the start of the game. Zero emotional investment, utterly immersion breaking. It is horrible, all the bugs and frame rate issues aside, who in their right mind removes the 'blank' character class from a RPG with a supposedly classless levelling system. By placing a boss, in the TUTORIAL area. Whomever was a play tester for this game needs to be black listed for gross incompetency.",3,2016-04-28,PC,user
SuperNaiv,"Where do I start? I really tried to enjoy this game. I played Dark Souls and I mostly hated the clunky controls and the tedious and dull combat. The pc port isn’t that bad as it was with first and 2nd DS game. Although, its long from perfect. In menu they only use Xbox buttons props. It doesn’t help if you use mouse and keyboard as your standard pc interface. Those lazy dev from ""From Software"" never learn. This should not be happening anymore! So, what made me continue playing. Well I was kind of interested in the world. I was trying to find out more about it. But the gameplay felt so repetitive and dull that, in the end, it felt more like a job then fun. The game mechanic is very problematic in my opinion, and one of my biggest problems is the locking mechanic on “one enemy at the time”. That wouldn’t be a problem if there was one, two or tops three enemies at the time. But most of the time, game throws at you multiple enemies, and very often from behind too, where you can’t see cause your camera is focused on only one enemy at the time. This is very annoying and very frustrating, and not something I would call “fun”. This locking mechanic is not a problem only on DS3. Its something that whole series is based on. What about the story? Is it any good? I would ask then; What story? If there is a story its delivered in very indirect and with some dialog from npcs that talk in riddles. I really didn’t care about the boring and uninspiring dialog deliverance from npcs. In Dark Souls I felt at least some kind of connection to the world. Here I don’t feel nothing. The first Dark Souls game was at least something original. The world, the story, and gameplay felt in many ways something new and creative. In DS2 and DS3 its more of the same, everything has been rehashed, it’s been copy and pasted, as many other games this days. DS2 and DS3 should never exist. The story was already concluded in the first game. From Software should instead focus on making something with a different story and completely different world. But I guess the hardcore fanboys would whine to much and demand new Dark Souls game. I could continue to list many more issues and problems with this game, but it would be too time consuming. Rather watch some informative videos on Youtube. I can see why ppl like it. And I can also see why ppl would despise this game. But, no matter what I mean, if you like Dark Souls you’ll probably will like this one too.",5,2016-04-27,PC,user
Zeratulr,"A broken piece of crap. The gameplay is as basic as it gets, it's unnecessarily hard, the game as is has no plot or characters and it's generally unpleasant.

defive,"Mechanically, probably the worst Souls game so far - 1. Combat is speeded up to the point of being silly 2. The removal of poise means that people wearing the heaviest armor can be stunlocked by low level mobs wielding broken swords 3. Terrible balancing of weapons meaning that straight swords are by far and away the best weapons 4.

Zen-Zinxe,"Dark Souls 3 is without a doubt the pinnacle of the Dark Souls series. Dark Souls 3 removes a lot of the pointless extraneous stuff from 2, streamlines a lot of features and takes some inspiration from Bloodborne. The game feels like a combination of every game in the souls series. Weapons arts are a new thing in Dark Souls 3, each weapon including bows and shields have a weapon skill. While the weapon movesets are more interesting because of this, it's not as in depth as bloodborne. A lot of weapons come as a dual wielded set, eliminating the need to not only find another weapon to dual wield but also not having to farm the supplies to upgrade a second weapon. Armor no longer needs to be upgraded, adaptability was removed and the stats are more like dark souls 1 again. There is a lot of fanservice in this game, lots of references to dark souls 1, the lore still is a jumbled mess that takes more work to put together than to play the game, but I expected as much. Honestly Dark Souls 3 doesn't feel like something new, it feels more like they took all the good stuff from their other games, and made a Dark Souls finale with it. It's a competent and near perfect rendition of Dark Souls, and after beating the game I gotta say I'm looking forward to seeing what else comes from FromSoftware because as much as I love Dark Souls, it is definitely time to hang it up and make something new.",9,2016-04-26,PC,user

Unlike DS2/BB, I did not encounter any difficult section where I got stuck, everything get completed pretty easily (not sure if I got better or if the game is easier, but it does feel easier). Did not encounter any crash (unlike other reviews here, playing version 1.04) Only reason I don't rate a perfect 10 is because of the awful convoluted NPC questlines that are hard to get right even following a guide.

The level design is fantastic, the bosses are difficult yet rewarding, there are various builds that are viable if crafted properly (dex, strength, int, faith, hybrids) and the lore is fantastic. PvP is also quite deep and co-op is a blast. In short, DS3 is an amazing game. I loved Demon's Souls and Bloodborne but never got into Dark Souls 1. I don't know why. I passed on DS2 when I heard it wasn't as good as the first. But DS3? Amazing. I finished one playthrough and immediately began my second and I'm still loving it.",10,2016-04-25,PC,user
WaddlesSandusky,"This is a great Souls game, and in my opinion, a great game overall. I really enjoy the combat, audio, and if you are able to stomach the fact that the mouse and keyboard controls aren't great, it plays well with a controller. I haven't had any performance issues, as some have reported, and definitely don't have any complaints with the game itself, since most people who buy the game walk into it knowing that death is one of the main mechanics behind the game. As for some negative reviews, I can understand most, and see why this game isn't for everyone, but if you are searching for a casual game with ride-along hand holding story, I would encourage you to look the other way, as this game doesn't cater to the player.",9,2016-04-24,PC,user

Vandinroth,"What a horrid console port. Game doesn't support 21:9 out of the box. The combat is clunky and it feels like you are fighting the animations and the time of them more than you are the enemy. Couple this with the clunky movement and that's the reason for most of the games perceived difficulty. It felt more like I had to fire off an animation in the general direction and hope it completed and I could move before the enemy did. The combat is more of a whack a mole than anything. Graphics are a huge mixed bag, you can obviously tell it was a console port. The skybox is laughably bad. The stand around monsters made me think I was playing everquest again with all the static camps. I wanted to like this game as most modern games are far too easy, but the clunky combat, ridiculous story, and static game just made me uninstall and refund after about 2 hours.",2,2016-04-24,PC,user
Tubey,"At times, this game is absolutely wonderful. The solid, heavy combat system and fluid graphics make for an immersive, totally brilliant experience. At other times, especially if you're a previous Dark Souls, it's a bit underwhelming in the mapping of the world, and the difficulty isn't quite the same as prior releases (not dumbed down as such... it's difficult to put a finger on it, but it doesn't seem the same. Not ""bad"", just not the same). Not only that, it doesn't feel designed at all for keyboard and mouse, which is disappointing, but thankfully the controls are sublime with a controller. Just bare that in mind before buying. They're the only complaints I have, and they are minor. An 8 is the bare minimum I could score this game. I don't like it quite as much as I did Bloodborne, but the ability to play it on the PC nudges it pretty damn close. There's very few games that can even come close to the atmosphere and majesty of this title. If you're worried about the reputation of the series as being ridiculously hard... all I can say is that this is hard in a fair way. Whenever you get hit or die, you understand why - this isn't hard like, say, an XCOM2, where RNG creates the difficulty; there's very little RNG here. Instead of thinking of it as prohibitively difficult, think of it as a master challenge.",8,2016-04-24,PC,user
twistedreal,"Pretty good game overall.I would have liked to give it a higher score but it doesn't have enough of an original feel. After sinking 100+ hours into DS1 and DS2 (as well as a playthrough of Bloodborne) there just isn't enough different about it for me to give it a higher score. It felt more like a continuation of DS1 and DS2. Ember form instead of hollow...okay I guess. Weapon art instead of **** bad, but not real innovative either. Onion knight instead **** wait, that's been done... Good graphics, good combat, level design, and bosses. This is a challenging game that you won't breeze through if you are careless. Like all the Souls games most of the difficulty is fair give or take a few areas. Again, this is not a game for a casual button mashing gamer. DS3 will not hold your hand so if you are easily enraged by video games then this probably isn't the game for you. Was not impressed with invasions. 9 times out of 10 it was 3v1. Hopefully they will patch it so that invasions are a little more fun rather than a 3v1 stunlock fest. -1 point Way too much fan service to DS1 for my taste. Would like to have seen more original thought put into it. -1 point. Also, I wish that certain NPC plot lines were a little easier to follow. It is very easy to do something out of order or overlook something and not get to follow a NPC through the game. Lore is a bit complicated to truly understand as is; so it is a real bummer when it's lost by not doing something correctly/in order. -1 point I'm sure there will be DLC for it coming out within the next year. However, I think I will personally wait until I can get it for a discount. This series has run it's course and it's time for something new. Overall this was a great game to end a great series with. I have thoroughly enjoyed it and I will also enjoy putting it to rest. I can't wait to see FROM is going to do next!",7,2016-04-22,PC,user
Darkwasp,"This is my current ""Best game I ever played"". It has everything that AAA game should have: astonishing visuals (though technically graphics aren't the best, but design itself is stunning), beautiful music, sound and voice acting (some Firekeeper lines in the later game literally gave me chills), atmosphere that's pouring from the screen, unique gameplay and of course a s**tload of developer's talent in between. Really, this is how modern $60 game should be made, it's definitely not a total waste of money like some recent titles (you all know what I'm talking about). Famous difficulty is still in place, and as before, it's serves it's purpose, which is not to frustrate people, but punish them for repeating mistakes and gave them deeper experience. Level design is the best I've seen in many years, these levels are gorgeous. They are big, complex, diverse and again, just beautiful. Dark Souls visuals are the thing in itself, really. Exploration is essential part of this game, and if you are not exploring these level, you're missing a lot of fun. But for me, personally, the most exciting thing in this game is it's lore. As usual, there are very few cut scenes and very short and sometimes confusing dialogues, but a lot of new item descriptions and little details in the game environment that reveal this world's story bit by bit. If you really into books or story-rich films/TV shows, don't miss this game, you'll never regret it. Overall, it's the best completion of Dark Souls series that one could possibly imagine, and I'm grateful to devs for that. P.S. I haven't experienced technical problems except for minor image stuttering, somehow all the problems people mention in their negative reviews passed. Also note for those who, like me, don't like gamepads and planning to play from kb+m controls - they are okay (-ish). Game was designed for gamepad, we can't do anything about it, but at least it's not that much pain as before, standard controls are acceptable, and you can of course remap things, but it's not much help.",10,2016-04-22,PC,user

About how this game runs in my computer, I only can say that I have had 0 problems (60 FPS constants, with occasional weird spikes that can impact the gameplay).

mondovious,"Dark Souls III is probably a great console game, however I cannot in good conscience rate it as a good PC game. The menus are horrid to navigate, the UI list's controller buttons even if you are using a keyboard (this is really annoying, and lazy by the devs), keyboard bindings experience delay and queing (click to attack but get knocked down before your attack goes off, your character proceeds to get up and then attack no matter what you do), inability to bind extra mouse buttons (seriously wtf). This is the -third- 'Souls game, the devs really should have ironed this stuff out by now. Content wise the game is honestly just more of the same of DS1 and DS2. The gameplay is the same, with some new features for weapon stances (that personally I do not like, as I believe forcing melee attacks to use mana deincentivizes hybrid spellcaster-melee builds), with most of the same items and similar areas returning from the other games. There is little to no story as per usual for a Dark Souls game. Honestly the games are too repetitive at this point.

AppleParts,"PRECURSOR: This is my favorite series, and Dark Souls 1 was previously my favorite game of all time. Obviously I'll be biased, but I'm going to try and make my bias as non-intrusive as possible and view the game objectively. I've invested 55 hours into the game and recently finished NG. I haven't played Demon Souls or Bloodborne, but have watched plenty of game play and story from both. I'll first address the actual game and game play, then follow up with design. Dark Souls 3 brings the challenge of Dark Souls 1 and Demon Souls with a balanced hybrid of DS1 and Bloodborne pacing. The combat system is so diverse and unique to any other game, the move sets, items, and techniques you can learn encourages the use of so many different options, and really allows the player to distinguish themselves from other players. The combat is quick, punishing, and challenging, most of the boss fights truly feel like boss fights based on their move sets, inherent damage and abilities, and you feel as if you are progressing and growing stronger throughout the entire game. DS3 truly improves on it's predecessors' overcoming challenge aspect, and you are not only rewarded with personal satisfaction of completing areas yourself, but with material rewards the game gives you as well through items, revealing new characters and new paths to take and explore. Online is fleshed out incredibly well (besides a particular bug) and provides more incentive to participate in online play, both co-operative and PVP, than in any other Souls game. The level design is incredibly unique and stylized, providing tons of opportunities to explore and meet new characters, as well as immediately (and indefinitely) immersing yourself into the world. The characters have unique personalities, the dialogue is captivating, and the miscellaneous quest lines and ways to end the game are seemingly limitless. The entire game is interactive based on the character you create and want to be, as well as interactive in the sense that most areas of the game flow seamlessly into each other, rarely creating any disconnect between immersion and exploration. The plot is just present enough to embed itself into your subconscious decision making, and just background enough to allow you to play the game without heavily investing into the story. Most of the controls are fluid and you can very precisely execute your plan of action throughout the game. Now from an artistic standpoint, it truly soars above and beyond it's peers in the gaming industry. The amount of detail, love, and disparity in the game makes it hard to believe something like this exists as a form of entertainment. The environments are sights to behold, with almost every surface you see you're able to explore, aside from distant backgrounds like mountains and deep canyons. The lighting and graphics are on par with titans like GTA V, and allows you to thoroughly inspect and appreciate the intricate armor and weapon designs, and the art and architecture of the world. The characters and story create such a unique feeling of emotional investment that your decisions and actions have real weight to them. As you walk through this expansive and vertical world you feel almost melancholic wondering why you're doing what you're doing, why there is so much suffering in this world, and why you must continue despite the failure and deaths of others. The soundtrack is absolutely mind blowing, how the score manipulates itself depending on your environment and current task. The elegant strings, the disdain of the brass, and the vocal chants make this feel like a dramatic opera rather than a video game (aside from one technical issue I found where the vocals were slightly clipped during one boss fight at a certain pitch). The world is deeply rooted into the previous games, connecting DS1, DS2, and even small homages to Demon Souls. The disparity of light and dark, life and death, and success and struggle truly make this an experience that no one will relive through another vessel for a long, long time. In the end it was one of the most unforgettable games I've ever played, and I'm saddened that this will be Miyazaki's last creation for the Souls series, at least for a while. If you're on the fence, you should know this is a hardcore RPG, so it will be no easy task to complete the story or fight other players. But if you invest yourself into it, you will not be disappointed. The feeling of accomplishment is unrivaled by any other series, the legacy of previous games is apparent and this is one world I think everyone can get lost in and truly enjoy themselves. Enjoy.",10,2016-04-19,PC,user
FadingHope,"Stay away from this trash IF you like complex, deep, elaborate combat. From start to finish, this game boils down to mashing two buttons: hit and roll. That's what you gonna be doing. It's the most dull, repetitive, shallow game I've ever played. The only redeeming feature is the graphics and the atmosphere, but when a game that's all about fighting fails dismally when it comes to the combat system, there's no saving grace. Don't get misled by all those 10's disgorged by fanboys, they're only playing it to prove how amazingly pro and superior they are to 'casuals'. If you look at any gameplay, you will see within 10 seconds EVERYTHING that games has to offer - a roll and a hit. That's all there's to it. Some of the enemies are gonna be bigger, some of the weapons are gonna be more rusty. But in the end this 60 dollar 'masterpiece' can be summarised in three words: roll and hit. 1/10.

smw119,"Now that time has taken the novelty out of the souls games, my concern was that the dark souls series had just become a soulless cash in (pun intended). What reason do we have to return to this world we've so devoutly conquered time and time again? How can I feel the same dread if things start seeming more and more familiar? One of the things about dark souls 1 that kept me so tense for so long was the fear of the unknown just around the corner. As a fan of the spiritual counterpart Bloodborne I had even more experience with the series that most. So what could Dark Souls 3 do that the other games hadn't? Only playing the game and experiencing it first hand would answer that. Now that I've experienced the game I realize what DS3 could do. Dark Souls 3 takes the best features and aspects of all it's predecessors, with a few nods to the devious demons souls, and combines them to provide a new experience. Taking the slow, methodical Dark Souls formula and injecting it with the animalistic brutality of Bloodborne, at first glance, would seem to diminish the strengths of each. But in practice what this does is take the situation where you and an enemy circle one another endlessly waiting for one to strike first and turns into an electric encounter where both combatants counter shields with kicks or lay into one another with the full extent of their stamina gauge etc. Every strategy and stance one can employ has a weakness or a counter that keeps the tension intact while speeding up the pace of encounters dramatically. Combine that with a sinister and clever AI and the results are your opponents in DS3. Every enemy demands you to take it seriously at knife-point no matter how small or under leveled they may be, which is what this series does better than any other. Having played both Bloodborne and Dark Souls for so long, I thought this game would be a familiar romp when, in reality, each enemy is cleverly reworked to force me to relearn what I spent so long learning in all the previous games. Every dominant strategy I settled into now has a glaring weakness that forced me to adapt further and try new strategies I was never comfortable trying before. This experimentation adds a lot of diversity to the game as it progresses and keeps things fresh and challenging even if you settle on a favorite weapon for an extended period of time. Taking this system and dropping it into a dark, medieval horror setting with beautifully rendered areas and very clever level designs and one can start to see what this game is about. How this game is able to keep it's focus clear and intentional all the way through is a great achievement by the development team. Nothing here feels like filler. Every area you will visit has a prevailing theme and each area is unique and different.Granted there are a lot of areas that may seem familiar due to their reference to previous areas, they are still well crafted and have their own intricacies. Being on the PC my experience has been, knowing what other's have experienced, a fortunate one. I have experienced no issues, no crashes, low load times, no bugs and no frame rate drops during my time in this game which places me firmly in a lucky minority. I can say, when this game works as intended it's a masterfully crafted experience. I imagine that issues which currently plague the game for some will be patched in the coming months. Can't recommend it more if you're a fan of souls games. If you're new, know that this game will get you up to speed fast and is the most accessible of the bunch, as hard as that may seem at first. Dark Souls has always been an experience that tears you down and builds you up twice as high. It's a tremendous experience that empowers the person who plays it patiently and diligently. Everything can be conquered, the game is still fair, but one must earn the right to move on to more exotic and daunting areas and face down more hellish nightmares. Dark Souls 3 is the sequel this series deserves and may be the finale that does the series justice, if the rumors of this being the last game of this nature can be believed. If your PC can handle the program well and it works as it was intended, this is an unmissable experience for anyone who likes any of FromSoftware's hellish journeys. As a fan of the series, I will be very impressed if any game dethrones this as my game of the year for 2016.",10,2016-04-19,PC,user

pessoadoalem,"top, dlcs tops, mundo acabando em contraste com o mundo abandonado de DS1 que tem criaturas e ambientes de naturezas diferenciadas. O jogo é bonito, o combate muito fluído, com muitas armas muito boas de se usar. Se vc prefere combate com arma de bater ao invés da putaria de magias de Elden Ring, jogue este jogo imediatamente. Melhor soundtrack da série, seções e bosses que vão te fazer lembrar como olhar pra palma da própria mão; armaduras muito bonitas, um jogo nota 10 de fato, e ta no meu top3 soulslike (o top 3 é todo da FROM kkkk)",10,2025-01-21,PC,user
ShineBlizz,"Dark Souls 3 is fantastic. I, along with many others, agree that Dark Souls 3 is the best in the **** only complaint I would have with Dark Souls 3 is its linearity compared to the previous two installments in the series. Aside from that, (and maybe the covenant farming...) Dark Souls 3 is everything you'd want from a souls game; amazing bosses, impeccable build variety, good world building/aura, the list can go on and on.",9,2025-01-18,PC,user
burnit,"Masterpiece. It's genuinely the best finale for a life-changing trilogy. It couldn't be a more perfect ending than DS3. Everything that DS1 did, DS3 took and raised to perfection, I mean, of course, the world design isn't as perfect and circular as the first game. But it's pretty close. The level design was wonderfully built and massively cared for, it's depressive, and frightening when it has to be, and mesmerizing when it has to **** bosses are not the hardest in the trilogy but are generally the cooler. Same for the script, the best run of the series when talking about character/lore development and the most touching and caring finals of the series. I was generally bought in on the final I got. I thought that the character I developed couldn't have gotten a more fitting ending. This game left me in tears after realizing the most perfect trilogy, with the most thoughtful, careful, and all-around perfect last title, had just ended. My favorite game from FromSoftware is one of the best games I ever played.",10,2024-12-11,PC,user
nirohero,"Weakest soulsborne game. It's the dodge-roll simulator boss rush personified. Dark Souls 3 lacks atmosphere, innovation, immersive level design, cohesiveness and is too fan-servicey. A lot of areas are reused assets from Bloodborne and some of the bosses are straight up bad. This game gets a good rep for its bosses but in truth there's 2 bad bosses for every good one. You can tell Miyazaki was forced to make this game due to the backlash of DS2 but he flopped pretty hard on this one.",4,2024-12-06,PC,user

kiozen,"""Dark Souls III"" marks a return to the series' roots, blending elements from previous titles with the faster, more dynamic pace of *Bloodborne*. The game delivers a smoother, more refined experience than its predecessors, with quick and responsive combat that grants players greater mobility while retaining the high difficulty that defines the series.Visually, *Dark Souls III* is stunning, featuring detailed gothic environments and a bleak, decaying atmosphere that enhances its dark narrative. The world is intricately interconnected, with areas that link seamlessly and encourage exploration. The boss fights are some of the best in the series, presenting memorable challenges and exceptional designs, ranging from terrifying creatures to majestic **** lore unfolds masterfully, revisiting themes and characters from earlier games and bringing many story arcs to a satisfying close. Multiplayer has also been improved, offering a more fluid experience with PvP and summoning systems, though some invasions can feel a bit **** sum, *Dark Souls III* provides a rich, challenging journey and a fitting culmination of the series, perfect for veterans and newcomers eager to explore its legendary, dark world.",9,2024-11-06,PC,user
Tombala78,"Dark Souls 3 is a masterpiece with its DLCS, very high-quality bossfights, improved in-game mechanics, and good map design (not too complicated).

tomhanwool1,"Gameplay: 9/10 (Basically, This is Fromsoftware game.) BGM: 8/10 (Personally, I like the Menu Screen Theme the most, the remaining BGMs don't leave much of an impression like Elden Ring and Bloodborne.) Lore: 10/10 (The story about the gods and Chaos Flame is full of Dark Fantasy. The longer I play, the more I want to learn about the game's world and its historical context. The plot has many similarities between Dark Souls and Elden Ring, I like both works.) Design: 7/10 (The boss design is not too impressive to me. Bosses mainly attack with melee weapons and Big Bosses mostly only use slashing attacks. Moveset chains are almost easy to dodge, you only need to die 5-10 times to remember all the movesets. I beat Nameless King and Souls of Cinder in just 15-20 respawns. The costume design and appearance of the bosses did not leave much impression on me. The design of the areas in the game has changed a lot from its predecessors Dark Souls, Dark Souls 3 gives me a lot of impressions with each different area applying great graphics in 2016 and even It's still not outdated now, when I first went to Anor Londo I was fascinated with the scenery of this city.) Weapon and Spell System: 7/10 (I only used one type of weapon while completing the game, which is the Sellsword Twinblades. I think this is the most OP weapon in the game when it combines perfectly with the Rings. Easy to use and easy to upgrade, especially you can pick it up at the beginning of the game, in Boss fights I mostly just roll and spam L1/LB. The other weapons I hardly use are not impressive, the Skill Weapon Boss is also not impressive to me, compared to the Elden Ring that inherits Dark Souls, it's a different story. During the Elden Ring experience, I was very interested and curious about Incantations and Spells, I spent a lot of time searching and collecting them. But for Dark Souls 3, there is no such feeling. Comparing the spells and icantation between Elden Ring and Dark Souls 3, it will definitely be Elden Ring. Perhaps I Elden Ring has left too much of its wonderfulness in me. 7/10 is deserved for it.) P/S: Dark Souls Scream is my favourite",8,2024-09-24,PC,user
ZAMPAGAMER,"Me gusto un monton, lo que mas, él diseño de los escenarios, algunos claro pero en general son buenos. Los jefes también son increíbles y un diseño espectacular todos. No puedo decir lo mismo de los enemigos normales que aunque si son variados, se repiten hasta en la sopa en todos los mapas y otro factor a tener en cuenta es la poca variedad de builds que hay, me explico. Si quieres una build muy efectiva por todo el juego, pues hay 3 o 4 mal contadas el resto te empezaran a servir ya al final como mucho ni eso. Pero por lo demás yo creo que esta muy bien y algo que no se puede olvidar es que la historia, a mi parecer es muy mala y aburrida, pero el final dando a entender que el enemigo eres tu mismo es increíble y las bandas sonoras del juego mejor ni hablemos porque no hay ni una en el juego que sea mala. A mi me encanto el juego y lo recomiendo para todo el mundo, mucho mas si eres nuevo en esto",9,2024-09-11,PC,user

jorki25,"After the Elden Ring DLC, I started playing Dark Souls. After a disappointing experience with Dark Souls Remastered, which felt more like a hiking simulator, I bought Dark Souls 3. The universe is quite nice with some appreciable references to Berserk, but my quest for challenge and difficulty was quickly cut short. Indeed, I expected the game to be harder than Elden Ring, but the game seems quite accessible to me. In fact, I finished the game in 19 hours, the bosses are not very difficult, I took less than 15 tries per boss, except for the final boss where I spent nearly 25 tries. The game remains good overall, the lore is engaging, but the lack of real difficulty is noticeable.",7,2024-08-02,PC,user

Moetowsky,"Dark Souls 3 is my first real encounter with ""souls-like"" games. This game completely changed my perception of video games and what they should really be. The game is challenging, but only because its mechanics don't allow for button mashing or the typical approach of running from point A to point B, marking off objectives on a map as you go—something that most games on the market have conditioned us to expect. Dark Souls 3 tests the player's actual skills, and the atmosphere of the game world and its mythology is just the icing on the cake. No one has the right to speak about video games if they haven't completed any game from the Dark Souls series.",10,2024-05-07,PC,user

TrueOptimist,"While it has a few modern touches, it still feels like a game from the past. Souls games have it all according to most people and while they have always presented epic boss fights and gorgeous environments, they always lack in one pivotal category for me. That would be quality of life. These games are always missing the little things that would really go a long way and making it so much more enjoyable for the player. I played this quite awhile ago, before Elden Ring, and while that game is the best thing they have created to date, it is also missing those same quality of life tools. Eventually they did add a few to Elden Ring, but this game is still devoid of them. At some point it wouldn't be a Souls game they'd say, if for instance they gave you more information on quests and you had didn't have to scrounge through weapon descriptions to piece together a story, but people will still love it if you did. The story in this one was not to my liking and ended with a whimper as the last boss is no where near one of the best in the game as well as being one of the easier ones to beat as well. Also, bosses to me would be much more interesting if they were used as ways to convey information, but 90% of them don't utter a word to you. I feel like they enjoy staying with their weird little niche game rather than telling a proper story, but at least we see with Elden Ring and Sekiro, we see they are more then capable of doing so when they feel like it.",7,2024-03-11,PC,user
