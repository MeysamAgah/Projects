Harshverma9580,Just using Three words to describe this game. A TRUE MASTERPEICE!!! What a story and gameplay with stunning graphics.must try game.,10,2025-03-14,PLAYSTATION 5,user
zellfernet,"This game is so beautiful that I cannot describe it enough. I was so sceptical about this game and how it would look in comparison to the original, since the original is so big and perfect but I can say I am amazed with Rebirth. The game is huuuuge and the world is so big and beautiful, graphics are impressive, gameplay is polished to maximum and the story is great. The only thing that is somehow downgrading the game is too many (stupid) minigames and quests that are forcing you to explore the world but are very boring because they are all the same in every region. Instead it would be better if the game is a little harder so you are forced to get stronger by yourself and with many more secrets to explore by yourself, like in the original. And of course, instead of a million stupid quests they could've made one big game (all three parts) at once. BUT, the game is perfect and you should play it ASAP! We are waiting now for part III.",10,2025-03-08,PLAYSTATION 5,user
louiestrider,"After playing 80 hounrs, I seriously couldn't take it anymore when I reached the middle of Chapter 12. Square Enix is so keen on messing with players and disrupting theirehythm. Admittedly, the world map and the combat system are incredible, probably the best, but the overall experience is the most frustrating and disgusting one I've ever had in any game.I guess the subtitle of the final episode will be Reunion, but honestly, I really don't want to ""reunite"" with the production team of Rebirth ever.",1,2025-03-07,PLAYSTATION 5,user
Nightmeer08,"One of my favorite games of the last several years. Almost everything about this game is perfect. The graphics are too notch, the gameplay is great, the story is solid of course, and the music is PERFECT. The side stuff in this game is also incredible. Towards the end I did find myself almost wanting it to just go ahead and end, just because it was so long and the end stages are very long. But that’s all final fantasy games",9,2025-03-06,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Ygzbrn1,"This game is one of the greatest of all time. İt takes what remake did great and bad, and takes them to a lot higher points. The charachters, combat, open world, the story... All are significantly better than remake. Dont get me wrong remake is a good game, a great game actually. But it had problems, a lot of problems. Now i wont get into much detail with that but Rebirth takes remakes flaws and polishes them till perfection. Of course there are some flaws in this game too like; filler chapters and its way too big for its own good. But still even with its mistakes, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is a near perfect game and one of the greates experiences that i ever had.",10,2025-03-01,PLAYSTATION 5,user
Docchicken13,"Amazing game, almost perfect if not for an annoying platinum where you need to Basically perfect all side mini games on hard difficulties. Some of the traversal mechanics can also be annoying at times but these are nitpick in an otherwise near flawless gaming experience.

I never played the original game, but between this and the prior FF7 on PS5, I am burned out on it.

alanwaketan,本作优缺点明显，先说优点。剧情演出爽，尤其是爱丽丝的部分让我这个蒂法党都沦陷了，No Promises to Keep单曲循环，Cloud到底在第三部要怎么找到和拯救爱丽丝啊，心急如焚！战斗体验又拔高了，合体技+合体动作爽。大地图中规中矩算是个合格的开放世界。但优点就这么多，剩下就要开喷了。作为一款2025年的游戏，重生已经完全落伍甚至有点不好玩儿。在手游大行其道的今天，一个3A游戏应该着重强调玩家无法通过手游体验的内容，但重生却在大量强调小游戏，一些手游上能获得更好体验的内容，实在是让人味同嚼蜡。这导致光彩夺目的主线被小游戏支线们拆得支零破碎，体验糟糕。我相信只看主线剧情视频通关的云玩家体验应该远好于正版玩家，又一个迫害正版玩家的游戏。然后制作组还塞了旧时代JRPG的负反馈机制，即缺省搞坏结局以及断档式难度的最终boss战，试图刺激玩家来重复游玩。再次重申在手游冲击下，玩家早就习惯各种宝宝巴士般引导，这种无聊且恶意的负反馈只会让我想摔手柄，比如约会任务一开门是条狗，比如打牌最后一战，比如那个又臭又长的最终迷宫，再比如boss战要全员一起上逼着我练所有角色。千言万语汇作一句话，只玩主线就好了。,9,2025-02-25,PLAYSTATION 5,user

PGwojowski,"Realistically I’d give it a 9.5, but I can only choose between 9 and 10 so I am giving it a 10. I bought this game a year ago, and I am still playing it. I am 150 hours in and playing on Hard Mode, and I am still having a ton of fun. I try to complete a side quest or two or three every night, and they’re all so funny. The cast is great! I was a little uncertain how I felt about some plot points a year ago, but a year later I feel really happy to have this title be a reality. It’s the best battle system in a Final Fantasy game probably since the PS1 era. It’s well adapted to modern gaming yet still retains the classic turn based play style. I love how difficult the game can be, as well. There are times when I’m seriously strategizing what materia to discard and what new combos to add in replacement. Absolutely cannot wait for part 3!",10,2025-02-24,PLAYSTATION 5,user

HxCore,"trop bon, revivre l'histoire de l'original avec plus de détail et plus de profondeurs, un vrai bonheur. Le jeu en lui meme n'est pas exempt de défaut et en particulier l'exploration des zones ouvertes qui est vraiment bof et trop de mini jeux. Mais pour le reste, la musique, les décors, l'ambiance, les combats et surtout l'histoire...mais quelle tristesse de revivre ce moment iconique du jeu vidéo... j'en ai pleuré... 10/10 ! merci square !",8,2025-01-27,PLAYSTATION 5,user

ExtraChasm,A must buy. An incredible world map with my favourite musical score! The character development throughout is brilliant. Replayability is also offered with Hard mode offering unique enemy movements and unique musical compositions that are only in Hard mode. Over 150 hours into this game as I hunt down the Platinum trophy.,10,2025-02-13,PLAYSTATION 5,user
SKSUND,"An absolute must-play for all FF7 fans old and new alike a simply superb game in its scope and magnitude. Rebirth faithfully recreates the world of Gaia in exquisite detail (as of course was the case for Remake), whilst simultaneously bringing the beloved cast to life with modern era graphics. The combat system incorporates a myriad of various strategies and is rewarding, engaging and thrilling whether you are an experienced action combat oriented gamer or a novice. With so much variety, the system does a great job in encouraging players to experiment with different play styles. From a graphical viewpoint the main cast and environments look spectacularly detailed, with my personal favourites being Nibelheim, Gongaga, The Gold Saucer, The Temple of the Ancients and The Forgotten Capital. The main story is faithfully recreated with some minor alterations along the way. The expansion of lore with respect to Gongaga, the Gi Tribe and the Cetra is very well executed and fills in some blanks from the original FF7 in a satisfactory manner. Aside from the main storyline, there are many side quests to complete along with battle simulation challenges aswell as a hard mode which ramps up difficulty considerably, when starting a new playthrough. The in game menus are logically presented and fairly easy to navigate through. The voice acting is spot on, in particular Britt Baron (Tifa), Cody Christian (Cloud), John Bentley (Barret) & Paul Tinto (Cait Sith) are exemplary. The only cons I would mention are open world navigation can be sketchy and frustrating at times aswell as a few mainline story sequences being cumbersome whereby the player is forced to navigate at a slow pace. However these minor issues are overshadowed by what is an absolutely brilliant overall package. In my opinion, Rebirth should have won the Game of The Year award hands down. In closing, you will not be disappointed with this purchase. PS, Tifa is absolutely ravishing, so fans will be delighted (I'm biased, I admit. That and she is my favourite character).",10,2025-02-12,PLAYSTATION 5,user
Rachidrahmoun,"Boring mess. Full of fillers, stretched out parts, Gold Saucer was horrible, Costa Del Sol was disgusting. Exceptionally overrated. Final Fantasy 7 Remake was amazing, linear, interesting until the end, but this one?

vincent770,"It's a great game and I wish I could give higher score. However, the amount of mini games forced to your face really marred my enjoyment of the game. It gets even more and more absurd toward the end with more difficulties added which essentially function only to waste more of your time while at the same time diminishing the fun out of the game. they are basically a chore. I forced myself out from more and more of them and each time I end up feel very annoyed. SPOILER: they dangle Tifa's progression as an excuse to force you play the minigame. Her sidequest forces you to play the card game, then having you be the chocobo race champion. They also lock 1 of her glove behind minigame. Good mechanic, good story, unfortunately marred by these unnecessary & unenjoyable bloat. They made a good base game, I just wish they didn't chose to be an ass about it, but here we are.",3,2025-02-08,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Toast4001,"The sheer scale and brilliance of execution deserves a 10 in my book. Rebirth cleverly builds on the combat system introduced in FFVII Remake and Intergrade and delivers seven playable characters with unique and interesting play styles (not even counting Zack and Sephiroth). The mini-games are a joy, I liked playing Queen’s Blood as much as the main game. Costa del Sol filled me with nostalgia for those golden years of video games where it seemed like every game was set on a tropical beach. My hope for the final game in the trilogy is that it will address some of the game’s shortfalls, namely the movement mechanics. At times, the auto-jumping and chocobo mechanics were frustrating, feeling lumpy. However the freedom of movement exceeded FFVII Remake by far. I also hope for more customisation options, by now we are getting a bit used to seeing Cloud, Barret, Tifa and Aerith in the same outfits. It would be nice to visually see equipped items, other than weapons and materials. I still rate 10 for the brilliance on display, fully exceeding my expectations and outdoing the first Remake game which was already very enjoyable.",10,2025-01-25,PLAYSTATION 5,user
saboteneko,"I would definitely rate this game highly. Massive open world with lots to explore, stellar soundtrack, a battle system that uses ATB and mixes it with action which is innovative and should be used as a model for FF battle systems going forward. Character stories are incredible with brilliant voice acting. Pretty much all of the events in Rebirth play out the same as they did in disc 1 and it also expands on the story with more. Overall, it should have won GOTY. I can’t wait for Part 3!",10,2025-01-25,PLAYSTATION 5,user

It’s clear some of the reviewers are just being harsh for fun. There is no way you can complete a game that gets a 0. Games that get 0 are games you can hardly play IMO and have 0 motivation to finish.,10,2025-01-25,PLAYSTATION 5,user

criticalgamer,"Yet another poor cashgrab entry for the Final Fantasy series, an ongoing experiment in exactly how bad of an experience you can make and still sell copies by Square Enix. FF7 rebirth somehow manages to take an even bigger step back from FF7 remake by adding in even more time wasters and gutting the story. Character VA sound like its their first time and have no guidance. Square has removed any actual decent gameplay and has replaced it all with minigames and unnecessary grinding. On top of that this game seems to be infected with the woke mind virus with the changes to Aerith's identity, completely dumpstering her in an attempted to pander. The OST sound likes something you would find on the epic asset store and game is frequently buggy and crashes. All changes made to the combat system were for the worse. I would say I can't believe they chopped 1 game up into three separate $70 purchases (plus DLC), but its Square Enix so I am not surprised. Please just go back to the old formula that people actually ENJOY. Companies are forgetting games are about having fun and not having ideology shoved down your throat while being forced to grind.",2,2025-01-24,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Mini games are really fun but there's too many, really too much, I reached 150 hours in chapter 12 as a completist, than I left some mini games beside.

Bagubuns,"Just because a game is professionally-made doesn't mean that it's a good game. The Final Fantasy VII Remake series has consistently proven that with its modern spin on the original game that nobody wanted. Actually, I can't even say that because look at the reviews! Look at yet another GOTY nomination that it didn't deserve and didn't win! While Rebirth was better than the first third that preceded it, the game is still ""follow the yellow paint"" levels of dumbing down the game. Back again are the unnecessary minigames and strange story altercations that didn't make sense in the original game, and are still just as baffling now. But hey, Tifa and Aerith's bikini models are finally HD! Tifa and Cloud are kissing now! So worth the altercations of the original, am I right guys?",7,2025-01-18,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Kokosnusseis,"This game truly impressed me. It continues the captivating story of the first part beautifully, drawing me even deeper into its world. The characters have grown even closer to my heart, and the quirky, Final Fantasy-typical moments kept me thoroughly entertained.However, I have to deduct some points for the occasionally meaningless and repetitive side quests in the open world. Despite that, it’s an amazing experience that I absolutely loved.",9,2025-01-13,PLAYSTATION 5,user
Feriatus,"It pains me to say this, but Final Fantasy VII Rebirth left me thoroughly disappointed. What could have been an exciting continuation of the first part instead feels like an unnecessary expansion—similar to when they stretched The Hobbit into three movies. It’s just too much of too little. To be fair, there are some bright spots. The combat system is genuinely fun, and the Queen’s Blood card game adds a cool twist. But unfortunately, the rest of the game falls flat. The story is paper-thin. If you boiled it down, there’s maybe 10 minutes of actual worthwhile content. The level design feels dated. And the side quests—don’t get me started. They’re repetitive and boring, more of a slog than a joy. Then there are the mini-games. They were quirky and fun back in the 90s, but here, they just feel frustrating and dated. What might’ve been charming decades ago now just feels like a forced distraction. I liked the first part because of nostalgia, but that’s exactly what this sequel relies on—and it’s not enough. At its core, Rebirth feels like a bloated, uninspired attempt to stretch out a story without adding any additional depth to justify it.",3,2025-01-13,PLAYSTATION 5,user
St1nzon,A great expansion. I had fun throughout the whole game and even fell more in love with the characters… but I am a little bit disappointed by the open world. Many side quests were really unnecessary and often repetitive,8,2025-01-11,PLAYSTATION 5,user
mpdizzle,"This game has lots of little issues, including not a small number of technical issues (especially on base ps5)--and yet I still think it deserves a perfect score overall, despite its many imperfections. It truly is a breathtaking experience; it is has an incredibly well written narrative that is told in an engaging manner; it has excellent pacing overall; an interesting world to explore; and a super fun combat system that is at once deep and easy to get into. The characters, from mannerisms to voice acting are superb across the board; also, this game has a lot of great, fun sidequests (better than remake in that regard)-- a common complaint lobbed against the game is the multitude of mini-games, and there are a lot. But honestly, alot of them are skippable (I skipped the protorelic quests, and basically all of the queens blood quests) and alot of the mini games are quite well designed (not all)--but overall, i dont think this detracts from the game. I don't love mini games in general, and i still loved and played a lot in this game because of how they were integrated into the story and sidequests; it made them much more engaging. Overall, it's an unfortunately technically flawed masterpiece of an RPG with a huge amount of carefully created content. I cant give it anything less than 10/10, and I didn't play the original in the 90s, so this is a nostalgia free score.",10,2025-01-10,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Scampi-Joe,Far too many mini-games that you have to play to get any further in the story and also to get some of the best items. The collection tasks in the open world are also more than just unnecessary. Apparently ubisoft was taken as a model here. The combat system and the story in and of themselves are well done,0,2025-01-05,PLAYSTATION 5,user
kwstas2,"Propably the best game I have ever played and I even played Elden Ring for hundreds of hours. This is for now in my opinion the absolute pinnacle of what a real time action JRPG can achieve. The game looks incredible even on performance mode and it beautiful design all around. The combat is incredible, the animations are world class and the attention to detail is beyond anything the series ever had before. It might not be exactly the game that every single person would give a ten but for me it certainly is. Square Enix might be my favourite developer and I can say with almost certainty that this is their finest work so far. This game is truly without a single doubt one of the greatest RPGs ever made!",10,2025-01-04,PLAYSTATION 5,user

There's a reason the original worked so well in one game, and that's because it didn't need it's story padding out with tons of filler, like they have here. Think of it like The Shawshank Redemption adding several extra hours worth of scenes of talking between Andy and his ****'s just pointless fluff.

The_Zarathustra,"This is a great game, ruined by dozens of hours of content that serve one purpose only: to make the game last longer. It's so bloated that many people (like me) won't be able to enjoy the few good parts the game has to offer. The sad thing is that the good parts are actually really good. But they're not prevalent enough to make the whole experience worthwhile. Unfortunately, I can say with confidence that I regret playing FF7 Rebirth because of these issues. So, let's start with the good: 1) The original story: this is, by far, the best part of this game. When it sticks to the original FF7, it's amazing, and can bring tears to the eyes of a long time fan like me. 2) The combat: it can be fun, but it's worse than FF7 Remake. As with everything in this game, the combat is bloated, excessively complex and the enemies are sponges that take too long to beat, all the while the windows of punishment are extremely narrow (i.e.: enemies stay staggered for a few seconds only). Now, let's talk about the worse parts of this game: 1) Side quests: I feel like SquareEnix simply does not know how to design side quests. Almost all the side content is shallow, tedious and unnecessary. It's really bad. They did try to create meaningful side quests and characters. But after playing games such as The Witcher 3 and Baldur's Gate 3, it's clear that SquareEnix needs to evolve a lot in this regard. If you hated FF16 side quests, then you'll hate FF7 Rebirth — and vice-versa. It's a SquareEnix issue, unfortunately. 2) Mini games: there are tons of mini-games. Tons. While some are fun, most are shallow, tedious and unnecessary. The problem is that some of them are mandatory — and they are the worst ones. You will remember this when a certain ""throw the box"" puzzle halts your progress. 3) Controls and navigation are clunky and unpleasant. Often times I felt like I was unable to properly control my characters, in and out of battle. 4) The open world: SquareEnix adopted the dated, obsolete Ubisoft open world model. There are towers, there are icons with side activity (that are really bad, as I mentioned before). Don't get me wrong, this model can work, and Ghost of Tsushima is proof of it. But this is nothing like it. This is a bland, empty open world with tedious side content. So, to sum it up, FF7 Rebirth is a bloated, unnecessarily long and tedious game, that will leave you angry because there is actually an amazing main story, that is thwarted by the absurd amount of shallow and utterly bad side content. If you want to enjoy the game, skip almost all side content and you'll be almost fine. But do not pay full price for this game. It's not worth it.",4,2024-12-25,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Where do I start, the open world is expansive and filled with lots of fun things to do, surprises at every corner. It's one of these games where if you do the side quests you'll be rewarded with more than just loot. I loved every bit of it, I did not expect tot like this game this much. The writing is great, the characters feel real with different motives and influences. I've read some reviews complaining about the mini-games. This game is built on mini-games, that's what makes it ever changing. There is silliness in some parts, but it's intentional and it's funny. Going through this game feels like playing multiple games all at once. If that's not appealing to you, maybe this game isn't for you. Take Queen's Blood board game as an example. You can totally ignore it, but if you don't there are plenty of surprises and twists. It's progression is a story by itself. If you can keep an open mind with all the side quests and mini-games, it'll definitely grow on you.

WeSN95,"Phenomenal story, art, score, and character writing. The introduction of long beloved characters is not dampened by expectation here. Twists and narrative decision making naturally draw the story out, allowing character relationships, story beats, andprogression to happen at a pleasant pace. At times, the linearity found in remake was more appreciable by my appetite, and some well hidden map markers, and lengthy or unfun map markers containing small to-dos would feel abundant and you might have just completed one area's map, and are greeted with another list of chores after only a brief story intermission. This is notmuchof a problem for those who skip side content or do not care to complete the map but leveling may be a consequence here asIwas always at or one above recommended level, while completing all side quests and map markers. All in all the strengths of the writing are mirrored by the strong gameplay. This iteration of action complimented by ATB, and a full cast of controllable party members and upgrade loop is my personal favorite modern FF combat system. Were it here to stay, we would have achieved the perfect blend of ability interaction and direct, sharp gameplay (perfect blocking feels awesome here). Even as an old school FF fan, who's first game was VI, I believe this is the single best system to integrate into the next numbered main series release, to blend accessibility and engagement from seasoned fans.

There are many different ways to approach how you fight your battles. You can change your settings to make battles more active or passive.

CloudTravels,"I really loved this game, it was a joy to play it from beginning to end, i've put almost 400hours into it, definetely my favorite game from this generation, truly a remarkable game. The creators stated that the theme of the game was bonds, given how important and well the relationships of the characters is done, i'm pretty sure they achieved their goal masterfully, the bonds between the characters are developed even within the combat when we use synergy abilites and synergy skills, they've truly done an impeccable job. I'd like to address some of the criticism regarding some people saying the game is bloated, so in defense of the game i'd say that, the problem with the game design is not the game offering too much stuff, it might be the game inviting the player to do all that stuff, but the actual content is mainly optional, and there's nothing missable in the game, so you can just focus on the main story and do the optional stuff later, besides that some of the mandatory minigames were also mandatory on the original game, so it doesn't make sense to criticize that.

Valentine_V,"Um jogo magnífico que honra o original e explora novos caminhos, enriquecendo o meu jogo favorito com uma jogabilidade moderna, gráficos deslumbrantes e uma narrativa incrível. Os gráficos do FF7 Rebirth são muito bons. O mundo de Gaia ganha vida ganhou mais detalhes que o tornaram mais vivo do que nunca - florestas luxuriantes, cidades movimentadas e paisagens impressionantes conseguem marcar ainda mais um jogo/franquia que já era inesquecível. Os ambientes são amplos, nos permitindo explorar um mundo vasto e envolvente. Os modelos e as animações das personagens são top de linha, com uma das melhores cinematografias que eu já vi em um jogo triple A. O Rebirth aperfeiçoa o sistema de combate em tempo real introduzido na primeira parte. Embora ele tenha um foco grande nos elementos de ação, inclusive introduzindo uma mecânica de parry agora, eles conseguiram balancear muito bem a ação e o combate tático com o ATB. A gente pode alternar facilmente entre os personagens, cada um com as suas habilidades únicas, o que torna as batalhas e o combate muito dinâmico e envolvente. Eles renovaram a interface do sistema de Materia, dando aos jogadores mais liberdade para experimentarem com builds diferentes. A adição de elementos de mundo aberto é um grande destaque. Com áreas maiores para explorar, o jogo oferece uma sensação de liberdade mais expansiva e mais diversidade de gameplay como um todo. Tem bastante variedade de missões secundárias, minigames e atividades opcionais no mapa, o que faz o jogo ser muito rico em conteúdo. A dinâmica das relações dos personagens é bem desenvolvida. Novos arcos de personagens e eventos acrescentam camadas ao enredo, expandindo o que existia no jogo original, especialmente com algumas mudanças notáveis na linha do tempo que se desviam do original e que na maioria das vezes funcionam em dar mais profundidade aos personagens. As atuações e as interações entre as personagens são excelentes, tanto as atuações em inglês, quanto as atuações em japonês, o elenco de voz da trilogia Remake é incrível. A música no Rebirth é uma obra-prima. As versões reformuladas de faixas icónicas, juntamente com novas composições, criam uma trilha sonora de cair o queixo. A mistura de nostalgia e inovação da trilha proporciona uma experiência inegualável.Final Fantasy VII Rebirth é um sucessor digno de Final Fantasy VII Remake, melhorando tudo o que o Remake já tinha feito e expandindo ainda mais o que a franquia oferece. A expansão do mundo, a profundidade do sistema de combate e as reviravoltas narrativas emocionais fazem deste jogo um jogo obrigatório pra qualquer jogador. É uma continuação fantástica que honra o legado do jogo original, que é um dos melhores da história.",10,2024-12-07,PLAYSTATION 5,user
SiegeX,"I've thought about this a lot, and I've also played most of the major releases this year, and I'm sure that Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the best game to come out this year, a truly fantastic game and one of Square Enix's best. The game has fantastic graphics, although it has visual problems that need to be improved, such as pop-ins, low-resolution textures, textures that don't load and strange lightning in some places, but despite all this the game is still beautiful, the performance mode also makes the game too blurry, so they need to improve on that for part 3, the combat animations are incredible, one of the best combat animations ever with some fantastic attacks such as the synergy skills and limit breaks. The combat system is one of greatest ever, perfectly combining action and turn-based elements, so the player has to combine both when facing some of the toughest enemies in the game, there's plenty of variety on the combat too, with each character having their own unique set of skills, allowing the player to choose how they want to play based on the characters they like best and the strategies that best suit their play style. The exploration is much better than the ones in previous Square Enix titles, with vast areas with lots to do, although they could improve some of the side stuff for the next game, perhaps by adding more variety of activities that are interesting, or by better balancing the side stuff and the number of side quests, the level design is pretty great too. The side quests are also a strong point of the game, they're much better than those in Remake and reward the player with character moments and character development. The mini-games are mostly great, some of the mini-games could be full games, like Queen's Blood and Chocobo Racing, but some minigames are poorly executed and needed better controls, like the Cait Sith box minigame and Gears and Gambits, but overall most of the minigames are pretty good. The narrative and characters are simply fantastic, I really liked the direction they took with the story, and the characters are the best in the history of video games, they managed to improve on the characters from the original game, even though they were already phenomenal, which is a great achievement and they should be very proud of that, even random npc characters like Cry Baby Ned are super charismatic, it's crazy. The music is on another level, the only game where the music also tells a story, it's simply beautiful and one of the best soundtracks ever. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a true masterpiece, probably the best game of this generation so far, even if the game doesn't win any major awards at the awards events this year, I have no doubt that it's the best of 2024 when we look at all aspects of the game objectively, given its complexity, level of quality, and sheer volume of content, when some people's main complaint about your game is that it offers too much, maybe you should know that you've done an incredible job.",10,2024-12-07,PLAYSTATION 5,user

hydreichomp,"This is EASILY the greatest complete JRPG experience ever created. It literally has EVERYTHING and keeps you engaged for over 100 hours. One of the best games Square Enix has ever created and the best they have made in a very, very long time. Combat, story, graphics, world building, minigames, crafting, hard content, quests, good characters, etc etc etc. It gives you everything, and more than you expect for each of those things. It's a remake so you can't put it in the ""Top 5 JRPGs of all time"", but it definitely is the greatest modern JRPG ever created. In fact, it has me scared for part 3, because I have no idea how the heck they can top this since the bar has been set extremely high, way too high to be honest. Would realistically give it like a 9.5 for personal enjoyment, but definitely closer to a 10 than a 9. The main reason I would not consider it perfect is since it is a remake, I already knew most of the story, so it was impossible for the story itself to hit hard, except at the new parts. Moreover, I do not think this game has very high highs like FF16 and other RPGs mainly due to being a remake and me wishing the combat and certain fights were a bit more flashier (but it lacks the low lows of other games too, Rebirth is consistently good). But looking back, I just have to say again, it really is one of Square's greatest works, the best they've done in years, and the most complete JRPG experience ever created.

Mega6staR,"The remainder of the original's 1st disc has nearly been mastered in this re-imagined structure of Gaia. Loads of story, gorgeous cutscenes to add with it, and the gameplay is becoming more outgoing for exploration. I've been playing Final Fantasy since 1991-92, and I've said(since FFX) we need open round trip planet traversing to return, and they're clearly pushing for that motive. The story seems to somewhat switch up a bit from the original(which is kinda worthless), and the mini games within the main story could be somewhat dumbed down a bit for FFR3 hopefully. Also, the game is over-saturated with allot of cuteness(let me explain). Like chocobos and moogles are what we all love, but it can sometimes make you feel as if you're watching Nick Jr. Example, they have the boxing goblin from the original, acting like a character off Sonic the Hedgehog. Square-Enix, take it easy with all the cuteness lol. The combat is extremely active, far more strategic andsatisfying for a Core FF Gamer like myself. This build is what the new Final Fantasy games always needed to become. I'm hoping this game gets GoTY 2024(I doubt it'll win but), I personally give it a 9.4 out of 10. They have to remain a bit more loyal to the story, no metaverse changing plots, they need their mini games in the myst of exploration, do NOT add it to the main story to introduce us. That main game/side game in-story tutorial isn't needed at all because it interferes with the story. No more ""Lure The Chicken"" missions(even if the outcome is epic lol), lighten up on Chadley, lighten up on the HUD also. FFVII OG had no HUD unless you were in combat(making it super immersive) without so much ""MISSION STARTED/MISSION COMPLETE"" pop ups. FFVIIR3 is the one to perfect.

alexkon3,"TLDR: This game is incredible. Go buy it but remember to play the game at your own pace. You can do every side content later! Review after 113 Hours FF7 Rebirth is a return to form for Square Enix. The developers wanted this game to harken back to the earlier Final Fantasy games with a World Map, exploration with Chocobos and Vehicles and they absolutely succeeded with that. The World of FF7 is beautifully realized every Town feels unique and is beautifully crafted, it really is fun just to explore every nook and cranny and listen to NPC dialogue in the background. Multiple times during the game I thought to myself ""Okay this region is great but there is no way the next region can be as good"" but then the game surprises you and gives you another beautiful carefully crafted region. The combat is a direct upgrade of the already amazing combat system of FF7 Remake, the Characters you already know have been expanded upon and got additional new abilities and the new characters Red XIII and Cait Sith have their own unique combat styles. Red XIII is a tank based around blocking enemy hits and fuelling his Vengeance Gauge which he can unleash and get expanded attack animations and more powerful abilitie, Cait Sith can summon his Moogle as a ride that he can dismount, the Mog then acts as an NPC fighter. He can also buff the other party members and his Gambling mechanic from FF7 OG returns and is fun. There are also the varied Synergy skills which add another interesting dimension to the combat, they can help you like characters flinging Tifa into the Aird or Protecting Aerith there are also Synergy attacks where characters perform a combined attack that not only looks cool but deals quite a good amount of damage. This game brims with side content. The Sidequests in FF7 Remake were pretty bad but here in Rebirth they became actually interesting and really accomplish what sidequests should be used for, expanding on your companions, each companion gets their own set of sidequests and every single one is good, funny and varied. The Exploration on the other hand is probably the weakest aspect of the game, while the regions are beautiful the exploration in those regions are all centred around the returning character Chadley who will contact you frequently and tends to interrupt the flow of the game. Most of the exploration is a very ""Checklist"" style of exploration where you are given a list of things you can do. This can feel very overwhelming to some players who feel the need to complete everything the moment they are at that area. The game does not communicate to you that you can actually return to those places later and complete these Region based Chadley Missions any time you want later on. There are also a ton of minigames, of different quality. The best one has to be Queensblood though, this Card Game is so addicting that I wish SE would release a separate game for it... please I need it. It is probably the best FF Card Minigame since Tripple Triad. There are of course a bunch of other Minigames, Chocobo Racing, the Bike Minigame from Remake returns, there is a funny Ball game Red XIII can play that feels a bit like Rocket league, Mushroom Picking exists for one sidegame (??). Not all Minigames are good but they are optional for the most part, there are a few times where the game forces you to play one but they can either be quit immediately or they are a one for one recreation of a minigame you were required to play in the Original FF7 (Dolphin Minigame, one Chocobo race) Story I will not spoil anything here. The Story was quite a bit expanded with multiple additions from the Compilation of FF7 and new lore added. Most of it is done really well and feels like it was always part of the game. The pacing in dramatic scenes is a weakness of Rebirth, while the scenes themselves are excellent they often get interrupted which gives them no room to breathe. The game of course gives you additional mysteries like FF7 Remake did, but it will not give you the answers, the Developers actively do not want to answer them until FF7 3emake so theorycraft away as long as you want to. Overall though I can say the story is very faithful to the original game, way more then Remake was in my opinion. Sound Graphics: There isn't much more I can say about the soundtrack of this game then that it is as always incredible. FF has always been the King of Game OST and this one is no different. Again you get beautiful overworld themes that seamlessly turn into a combat Remix, you get beautiful remakes of old tracks like the beautiful Cosmo Canyon theme or fantastic new songs like the Queens Blood theme. Graphics wise the game does look good but it does suffer from common problems of UE4 games. The lighting can sometimes be very off and there is a bunch of pop in. There are sometimes some really low resolutions but that is a given with a game that big. Overall Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is one of the best games I have ever played",10,2024-11-18,PLAYSTATION 5,user

EvanC2332,"Absolutely beautiful game, I love the detail on the fiends, I love the style. I love the story changes to the original, it’s an excellent way to reintroduce the mystery from the original into a very well known story. The only time I had a real problem was in chapter 10, I got a bit bored part way through and frustrated with the length of some of the levels (it’s a bit much exposition), but the gameplay got me through it and I ended up really appreciating that part of the story by the end of the chapter. The ending fights are absolute fan service in the best. A real have your cake and eat it too scenario, and I’m personally all for that. The combat really shines in this part, it’s intuitive but still challenging and very rewarding to learn the intricacies of. The music and sound design is incredible (obviously). The mini games are in general pretty good (if difficult at times, but they’re also optional so…). Overall, you can really tell the amount of love and effort put into this game.",10,2024-11-17,PLAYSTATION 5,user

MaryRules,"A majestic experience that I will carry with me forever, it is impressive that even months after finishing the game, I still keep thinking about it and wanting to play it again, when I finished the story for the first time I could barely sleep and I spent a week thinking about what happened, without being able to start other games, this is an incredible feat that few games can achieve, so it's obvious that for me Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is a masterpiece. It's impressive how much the Square Enix development team managed to improve from the first game, especially considering that the first part of the trilogy was released in 2020, most triple A games take longer than that and often don't evolve as much as this game. The combat is better than the first game, faster and more fluid, we can use summons at any time now and we have new synergy skills between the characters, which are simply wonderful, adding beautiful attack animations, which also highlight the character relationships. The minigames work as a great way to vary the main gameplay of the game, the main minigames are excellent, like Queen's Blood, which is the highlight among all the minigames created and is an incredible addition, very fun, with a lot of depth despite seeming simple at first, it could even be its own separate game, the Piano minigame is also wonderful, despite being challenging and having a high difficulty spike when you get to Two Legs Nothin to it, and the Chocobo races are sensational, reminiscent of classic kart games like Mario Kart and Crash Team Racing, most of the other minigames are average and a few are weak like Gears and Gambits, the ones with the frogs and the one with the boxes when you play as Cait Sith. The soundtrack is spectacular as always in Final Fantasy games, with an insane amount of music, including new songs and new versions of classic ones. The story is excellent, adding more details to the story of the original game, and a few more arcs that will be explored in the final part of the trilogy, so I don't think it's possible to judge completely yet, the secondary missions have also improved a lot, with stories that develop even more characters. The characters are fantastic, some of the best characters ever made in the gaming industry! Even Cait Sith is cool now. Regarding the negative points, as no game is perfect, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth also has some defects that can be improved on for the final part, the animations of some exploration actions are a little janky, like Cloud's jumping, or when we hang on ropes as Yuffie, the camera lock-on can change targets very easily at times, it wasn't frequent on my playthrough, but it's annoying when it happens, and the game also has some technical problems like pop-ins, textures that don't load, low resolution textures and weird lighting in some places, these issues are minor, so I don't think they detract too much from the game as a whole, I also didn't have any bugs or crashes. Another point that I have seen other people criticize is about the game being bloated, which makes the game's pace slow and boring according to them, but I believe that this criticism doesn't make any sense, given that most of the things that are criticized are optional content in the game, which exists as a way to add even more value and things for you to do in the world if you wish to, but, which you are not obligated to do, of all the minigames, I think only four are mandatory throghout the whole story, being the following, the Dolphin minigame at the end of chapter 4, which is very short and an improvement on the original, the minigames in Costa Del Sol for you to get beach wear for Cloud, Tifa and Aerith, the Chocobo Race minigame to escape Corel's prison, which is also faithful to the original game and much better, and the box minigame with Cait Sith, which really is one of the low points of the main game, apart from these moments, everything else is skippable, including the Queen's Blood tournament on the Shinra Cruise, so to me this type of criticism doesn't make sense, every open world game offers you a wide range of optional content to make the world richer, so this type of criticism would be applicable to any open world game, including classics like GTA San Andreas, GTA 4, Bully, Red Dead Redemption, etc. Who doesn't remember the famous bowling with Roman in GTA4, or the terrible mission with a miniature plane in GTA San Andreas. Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is a masterpiece, it's the most complex and ambitious game I've played this year, and certainly a game that marked me forever and will survive the test of time.",10,2024-11-12,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Simply locking on to the enemy you want does not work well. Maybe I’ve been spoiled by souls games but whatever is going on with the lock on ****. You will face an enemy you want to eliminate then try lock on, then you will actually lock on to someone closer you at your side then the camera will pan to them boom now you are locked on to someone you didn’t want. Then you have to flick to them while getting attacked. It’s crap. Happens almost every fight. The world is also filled with Ubisoft class open world crap to do (fight this enemy this way, gather this, etc) it ****.

Ephremjlm123,"OG player here and I honestly finished the game later so I had my pre-concieved notions knowing the story was going to change. That said, I was completely shocked at how far the Rebirth team went over and over and over again. About 40 hours in and I realized that ""holy crap this is what I've been waiting for in a next gen FF game, it's really not a drill."" The combat is my favorite in any game thus far, hands down, no contest. They somehow figured out how to make the open world map travel feel good and like THE OG but in a modern era. The additions to the characters via the writing and animation was brilliant and made me not only love them more, but fall in love all over again. The voice acting, at least for an American audience,was top notch. Whether or not you like a character you cannot deny that each one feels real and alive. They sold us on them so we'll that after the credits rolled it felt like a group of friends I grew close with just left me for however many years until the next game. Even with the changes I somehow felt that same gut wrenching feeling in the end. This game is a literal 10/10 for me.even at its lows it's so much better than most things we get these days and I REALLY hope the rest if SE was taking notes on what this team was doing and how they did it because my god not only did they deliver a masterpiece, they did it in record time.

Les clins d'œil à l'opus original et à la saga FF sont nombreux. Le gameplay, déjà incroyable dans Remake, est absolument jouissif. Les émotions des personnages à travers les magnifiques cutscenes sont palpables. Les ajouts scénaristiques ne plairont pas à tous mais ils s'agit d'un parti pris.

CarpathianDevil,"I could write for days on FF7 Rebirth. I took 2 weeks off of work to play this, as I did for remake. I've been playing rpgs since the 80's. My first jrpg was Dragon Warrior on NES and I played Final Fantasy 1 on NES the day it was released. The FF series has had it's ups and downs throughout the decades and Rebirth is definitely a high. I loved the OG FF7 and consider myself a huge fan. I purchased the collectors edition of Rebirth and I have zero regrets. To sum up, FF7 Rebirth added so much onto what Remake started. Remake in retrospect almost feels like a blueprint or maybe more of a primer to what Rebirth would eventually become. It has so much to do in it, it's one of the few games that I feel actually deserves the $70 price tag. By the time I was done, I had dropped about 121 hours into it and I haven't even finished everything. It was a wild ride with absolutely incredible action combat, lovable characters, beautiful locales, charming and exciting music and nostalgia for days. I can't recommend this game enough. As an older gamer, I've become a bit jaded with games lately. It takes a lot to impress me. With rebirth I found myself laughing out loud, clapping and just having the time of my life playing Rebirth. I've played thousands of games throughout the decades and I can't remember a time I've had so much fun and enjoyed myself, I felt like a kid again. I wanted to explore and experience every nook and cranny of FF Rebirth and it felt great doing it. When all was said and done, I thought to myself, this game definitely makes my top 5 games of all time list and most likely will be considered as my favorite jrpg all the time. It easily makes the list with other greats like Xenogears, OG FF7, Dragon Quest 11, Persona 5, Legend of Dragoon, FF7 and Chrono Trigger. This is what a game looks like when the developer is both highly experienced and filled with passion for the game they are making. 10/10 is very rare for me to rate a game, but FF7 Rebirth deserves every last bit of it, easily.",10,2024-10-30,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Mcnugget99,"Great theme but poorly executed as a game. The goods: - Interesting main story - Great characters and team synergy - Beautiful regions The bads: - Clunky combat: dodge doesn’t do anything, block is not immediate. Pressing the block button doesn’t stop the basic attacks. It’s too late to press block by the time you see signs of enemy about to attack, because the game would still be executing the basic attack commands. - Minigames and puzzles: hate playing Mario party while trying to save the world. - Open world exploration: marking everything on the map and telling players exactly where to go is not exploration, it’s simply checking off items on a list. And it’s the always the same objectives in every region. Chadley is annoying. - Side quests: most of them lack in depth and are a distraction to the main story. E.g. catching chicken or helping some random villager train in Gongaga. These side quests are something to be checked off (like the open world objectives) rather than something fun or meaningful. - Romance: the game picks a date for you! Good luck if you want to date Tifa but hasn’t done her side-quests filled with mini-games. - Forced party selection: especially hate playing as cait sith. Put together, you’ve got a big, beautiful but empty world filled with laundry lists of repetitive open world objectives, menial side quests, and frustrating minigames and puzzles, all of which interrupt the game pacing.",7,2024-10-29,PLAYSTATION 5,user

DrakengardLover,"This is one of the most overrated games I have ever played. Its one of the worst examples of filler and padding to increase the run time of the game. If this game did not have the Final Fantasy IP attached to it, it would just be seen as another generic open world JRPG with open world quests that are on par with Ubisoft with how copypasted and lazy it is. There is so much potential and so many great things about this game that is ultimately held back by how needlessly tedious it is, and with how bad the ending is. Making the remake of FF7 a trilogy that will more than likely span across three generations of consoles was never a good idea, but I am not surprised by how much less this game sold compared to Remake. I hope Square locks in and actually makes a cohesive game that doesn’t add in more filler to pad the run time and does FF7 justice, but my hopes are not high with them and I will not be buying the next game until it is at least half off on sale. Also the Caith Sith Shinra Manor section in Chapter 11 is one of the worst in all of gaming, and whoever was in charge of that should never be allowed to make games again without heavy supervision.",5,2024-10-29,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Stevie0022,"Definitely my GOTY… As someone who played the original Final Fantasy VII back in 1997, diving into Rebirth felt like catching up with an old friend who’s had an incredible makeover. This 2nd entry in the remake expands further on the original story and characters in a way that feels fresh but still familiar. From the get-go, I was captivated by the stunning environments and attention to detail. The combat system is a solid blend of real-time action and strategy, making battles both fun and challenging and sees a vast upgrade to Remake. I ended up sinking hundreds of hours into the game, chasing that 100% completion and finally **** the platinum trophy—it was quite the journey! The writing struck a nice balance between nostalgia and new content. The characters are well-developed, and the dialogue often had me laughing or even misty-eyed at times.

OrangeClock,"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth has mistakenly created a wrong path of RPG development by drawing players attention toward an incredible amount of mini games and other relevant elements. The worse situation is that much of these minigames are not really interesting. They are a very solid distraction and obstacle, stopping players from focusing on the story and narrative. It is undeniable that developers are making efforts to improve the quality and volume of their work. The graphics look terrific, the music and art designs are just as remarkable as any other Final Fantasy games, and designing various types of minigames will also consume time and resources. But this is not my expectation for the RPG's development. I would encourage the producers and developers of the Final Fantasy to focus more on stories, characters, and performative combats that excite us. There is very limited progress on Cloud's journey. Questions left by the story of ""Final Fantasy VII Remake"" remained unsolved. Therefore, while I am frustrated with this game, I am still looking forward to playing its sequel, which is the last episode of the Final Fantasy VII trilogy. I wish to see a significant decrease on mini games and relevant elements. Hopefully the story will have a strong ending.",7,2024-10-25,PLAYSTATION 5,user

DerReyOfficial,"Uff einer der schlechtesten FF-Teile überhaupt. Level-ups und auch neues Gear fühlt sich irrelevant an. Jeder trash Kampf dauert zu lange, wodurch man die Lust verliert überhaupt zu kämpfen. Jeder Bosskampf hat irgendwelche nervigen Cutszenen und Phasen den den Kampf einfach nur unnötig in die länge ziehen. Das Balancing zwischen den Charakteren ist absoluter Mist (Yuffie und RedXIII absolut ob wenn ""richtig bestückt"" Rest maximal mit einem ""alle"" spell zum grinden ok). Ständige Zwangsaufteilung der Gruppe nimmt die Freiheit so zu spielen wie man will und zwingt einen in Charactere die man nicht spielen will. Zwangs-Minigames die komplett optional seien sollten Ich glaub das reicht erstmal an Negativen Punkten mmh viel Positives bis auf die Musik und das es hübsch ausschaut (was für mich keine Relevanz hat wenn das Gameplay nicht gut ist) Eine der größten Enttäuschungen der letzten 20 Jahre",1,2024-10-23,PLAYSTATION 5,user

And after for more than a 2 decades, anyone can confidently say that this is a true Final Fantasy experience.

GideonGilead,"I first played Final Fantasy VII when I was about 8 or 9 years **** changed gaming for me in the best way possible. Alongside Metal Gear Solid, it was my favourite game of all time as a child and I have played it through at least 15 times, as recently as a few years ago. Rebirth is absolutely abysmal. Without any ounce of hyperbole, it is one of - if not THE worst game I have ever played on the PS5. Every single time you do something, you're forced to walk and listen to characters talk. Finally, some **** wait, I'm walking and listening again. Quick, that person is escaping! Aaaaand Cloud is walking again. I don't understand how this game is rated as highly as it is, I really, really don't. Did I get a different version of the game? How are people saying this is one of the greatest games of the year, let alone one of the greatest JRPGs? I have never in my life been so miserable playing a game. I genuinely cannot fathom how Final Fantasy VII has become something professionally designed to be as tedious as possible. Just stick to the original, it's infinitely better in every way. And no, this isn't me saying “games were better back then!”, because despite everything, I actually really enjoyed Final Fantasy XVI. Christ, I honestly think if I said that to people, they'd chase me out of the city. I despise this game with every fiber of my being.",4,2024-05-05,PLAYSTATION 5,user

therealsayuri,"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is nothing short of a breathtaking triumph that captures the essence of the beloved original while boldly charting new territory. From the moment you step into its vividly crafted world, the game envelops you in a rich narrative filled with emotional depth and character development that rivals the best in modern storytelling. Visually, the game is a feast for the eyes. Every environment is beautifully rendered, from the sprawling landscapes of Gaia to the intricate details of urban settings. The animations are fluid, and the character designs breathe new life into iconic figures, making them feel fresh and relatable. Combat is where Rebirth truly shines. The hybrid system merges real-time action with strategic elements, allowing for exhilarating battles that feel dynamic and engaging. The addition of new mechanics and characters enhances gameplay, keeping encounters fresh and exciting. Boss battles are particularly memorable, each presenting unique challenges that test your skills and strategies. The soundtrack is a masterpiece in its own right, blending nostalgic motifs with new compositions that elevate emotional moments. Each track seamlessly integrates into the gameplay, enhancing the immersive experience. Narratively, Rebirth takes daring risks, expanding on themes introduced in the original while introducing new storylines that keep both newcomers and veterans on their toes. The character arcs are deeply engaging, with moments of genuine emotion that resonate long after the screen fades to black. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is not just a sequel; it’s a redefinition of what a role-playing game can be. It’s a celebration of the franchise's legacy, wrapped in innovation and creativity. This is a title that will be talked about for years to come—a true 10 out of 10 experience that every gamer should play.",10,2024-10-12,PLAYSTATION 5,user

All of this though has changed, the story simply put, is amazing. The characters are still extremely well written but the voice acting has drastically improved as well. graphically the game not only runs well but looks beautiful as well, and the side content is actually good.

Drake_Du,"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a triumph. What Square Enix managed to achieve with Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is nothing short of impressive, a game that was developed over a period of approximately three years, that is extremely rich in high quality content is something surreal nowadays, the entire basis that was built in the first game of the trilogy is improved in the second game, which is a wonderful feat, and which I hope will serve as a foundation for the next games in the franchise. Regarding gameplay, Final Fantasy VII Remake's combat was already excellent, with a great mix of action combat and strategy elements that respected the original game, the only negative points were the aerial combat that wasn't good with characters that depend on melee attacks like Cloud and Tifa, and the use of Summons that was restricted to certain larger environments, fortunately these two points were improved in Rebirth, melee characters have new gameplay mechanics added to their kits, which make aerial combat very fun and responsive, the combat as a whole is more fluid and faster, and regarding the use of summons, the game's camera is now a little further away from the characters and the scenarios are wider, which allows summons to be used at any time in the game, in addition to that, combat has been expanded with synergy skills that add a type of attack that is spectacular to watch and which adds even more personality to the game's characters, the variety in gameplay is also huge, given that we have seven playable characters, each with a unique combat style and many possibilities of how to play given the different materia builds. The minigames work as another way to diversify the game's “standard” gameplay, most of the minigames are very good, with emphasis on Queen's Blood, which could even be a game in itself. There’s also a relationship mechanic between the characters, which affects who you will go out with in the Gold Saucer date, it is very well designed and adds weight to the choices the player makes when responding to the other characters in the group and is an expansion of what existed in the original game. We have several ways to navigate the world this time, with vehicles and Chocobos, it's just incredible, just when you think the game can't give you anything else, suddenly you get a Chocobo that practically flies in the air, that's fantastic. The game's level design is also much better than Remake’s, which was very linear and simple, now the game has more verticality and great exploration, the variety of biomes is also great, and the updated version of cities like Kalm and Cosmo Canyon are beautiful. Regarding the story, the characters are simply incredible, probably the cast of characters in FF7 is the best cast of characters in the history of video games, and in this game they do justice to the characters from the original game and make them even more interesting, the quality of the side quests has improved a lot too, with interesting stories for each of the sidequests, which reward the player by adding more depth to the characters. Regarding the soundtrack, as well as in the case of the cast of characters, FF7 has one of the best soundtracks in the history of video games, and in FF7 Rebirth they created around 400 songs, adding a lot of variation to the franchise's main songs, and creating lots of new music, which is played in different areas and at different moments of the game, it's simply a brilliant soundtrack, and one of the best ever made in the gaming world. Regarding the negative points, most of the game's negative points are about technical aspects, such as the performance mode that makes the game look blurry, textures that don't load, low resolution textures, pop-ins, strange lighting and shadows in some places, but these problems are small and are not enough to hinder or take away many points from the game as a whole, I also didn't have any bugs or crashes during this game, which is impressive for a game of this size and with such complexity. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a game that transcends the fact of being just a fun game, and becomes a fabulous work of art that I will carry with me forever, for that I will be eternally grateful to the developers at Square Enix who managed to achieve this enormous feat, honoring one of the most important games in the history of video games. Thank you very much.",10,2024-10-07,PLAYSTATION 5,user

JM8,"Incredible World Building with such amazing personalities leading this story's cast of characters, along with the addition of Yuffie to the main cast, this story is a little bit jarring for the direction its going, but it does not diminish the journey for me. This story is trying to be a retelling of the original game's events alongside creating new events. This is also done with the inclusion of Zack Fair, the protagonist of another one of Square's games, Crisis Core. It does come off a bit confusing at first, as Zack Fair is not suppose to present this late in the original story, but it is clear that Square is paving the way for another possibility of the original Final Fantasy 7 Story. All the while, they are focusing on the aspects that people loved from Part 1 of this remake series. Overall, FF7 Rebirth gets a 10/10 from me. It's one of the games I absolutely adored this year.",10,2024-10-05,PLAYSTATION 5,user

But in ff7rebirth, i gradually have knew the interest of it. I even can say that this module must be the best solution of JRPG. The story of ff7rebirth is also **** because SE divided this whole story into 3 parts, I think i should evaluate it after playing all three games. In addition, the games in ff7rebirth are also very fun,but i think SE should reduce the quanity. However, there are inevitablely some problems,such as the detail of scene interaction, resolution ratio, and so **** conclusion, the music,theCG,and the story cover up these disadvantages.

The original Final Fantasy VII was full of fun and silly minigames throughout the game, and this game not only takes some of those minigames and innovates on them, it creates all new mini games that are even better than the original (Queen's Blood being a fan favorite). And it's not even just about the minigames giving a lot of extra content, the game itself is amazing even without the minigames. The story as per usual with games in the Final Fantasy VII compilation is great, taking the original story and making it something new and old players can enjoy. The voice acting is done beautifully, the music is amazing, and don't even get me started on the combat system oh my god.

Luxar_,"Si el concepto de anime de Naruto fuese llevado a un videojuego, éste se llamaría Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. La historia se siente exageradamente estirada, las misiones son infumablemente aburridas, los nuevos personajes secundarios se sienten muy muy muy mal, y son muy olvidables. De las 75 horas que pasé jugándolo unas 35 fueron de puro tedio. En cuanto al mapa: los puntos de interés del mapa se basan en o bien mata a x grupo de monstruos, o bien pulsa triangulo en las piedras de mako, o bien pulsa un patron en los stands de invocaciones, o bien activa la torre al puro estilo far cry 3 (pero mucho peor). Lo de las protomaterias no estuvo mal, pero sin más. Mucho mapa, pero nada interesante que hacer. El combate: Si estas en modo normal con spamear L1+ Triangulo hasta dejar al enemigo vulnerable y luego L1+Cuadrado para matarlo te haces a todos y cada uno de los enemigos del juego. Los enemigos que más dificil se te harán serán porque tendran ataques que no se podrán esquivar, una cosa que me parece lamentable que pueda existir en 2024. La música: Lo siento, pero prefiero la banda sonora del FF VII original mucho antes que esta. Gráficamente el juego se ve sobresaliente bajo, es un paso atras respecto a FFXVI, pero se ve excepcionalmente bien. Soy fan de la saga desde pequeño y no me parece mal juego, me parece un juego que tiene el aprobado, pero sin más. Podrán decir lo que quieran, pero en unos 150 GB que pesa este juego, y si hubiesen recortado contenido innecesario podrían haber creado perfectamente un remake de Final Fantasy VII que cupiera en un único videojuego.",6,2024-09-30,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Taser9001,"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth serves as the second part of a three-part reimagining of an all-time classic RPG tale. It continues Final Fantasy VII Remake's habit of enhancing and adding new story elements to what some consider Square Enix's greatest masterpiece. Picking up from the end of Remake, as Cloud and the gang leave Midgar and explore the wider world of Gaia, Rebirth takes many iconic locations from the original PS1 game, and gives them the rebirth they deserve. With new life breathed into it, this fantasy world feels more alive than ever before, and looks stunning to boot. As is the trend throughout the Final Fantasy series in general, the music is astonishingly good, taking an already amazing OST, and creating new greatness with it. The music is dynamic, and fits the world it is attached to superbly, and works amazingly well with the game's sound design. Not only are the sound design and music a treat for your ears to behold, but so is the voice acting. With a whole array of voice actors returning to voice this iconic cast, as well as newcomers coming in to voice those who were absent from Remake, the acting is among the best of the Final Fantasy franchise. The one thing that could potentially put people off a little is the abundance of minigames, some of which are necessary to progress the story. This shouldn't be anything new or too daunting for veteran Final Fantasy fans though, as the original Final Fantasy VII was very much the same. Whilst the side content and most of the minigames are optional, they are very much worth doing, as they are fun and help bring the world to life even more so. Perhaps one of the most important things is its gameplay, and wow, the combat is easily among the best, if not the very best, of the series to date. It takes everything that Remake does right with its combat, and improves upon it. Its combat is incredibly easy to pick up, and those who put in the time to master it will enjoy the harder challenges that the game has to offer and test the player's skill with. This game is an absolute treat for Final Fantasy VII fans, and should be on every Final Fantasy fan's must play list. It is easily one of the strongest entries for quite some time.",10,2024-09-22,PLAYSTATION 5,user
lifeiswonder,"A beautiful rebirth of our memories with *Final Fantasy VII*. Although it is a remake, it successfully updates and alters the story flow in a way that feels natural rather than jarring. The game carefully remakes and utilizes the original content and culture, showing how much Square Enix has learned from their previous titles, like *Final Fantasy XV* and *Final Fantasy XVI*. Their commitment to high-quality, detailed game development is evident, and their passion clearly resonates with players. If I were to find one drawback, it would be the mini-games. While most of them are of high quality and quite enjoyable, making them optional for the main story would be a good improvement. Overall, the game boasts a well-made system, superb music, and stunning visuals. I believe it's nearly perfect!",10,2024-09-22,PLAYSTATION 5,user

gorthaurmog,"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a masterpiece that transcends expectations. The epic narrative, which continues the events of Remake, offers a new perspective on the iconic FFVII universe, expanding the story in meaningful and exciting ways. The game not only respects the source material, but also brings surprises that keep even the most dedicated fans on the edge of their seats. Every dialogue and character development is handled with care to provide a deep emotional immersion. Rebirth’s combat system is a perfect evolution of what we saw in Remake. The mix of real-time action and strategic commands works smoothly, allowing the player to have complete control over their characters while managing skills, magic and limits. The diversity of enemies and bosses makes each battle unique and challenging, without ever becoming repetitive. The world of Rebirth is vast and incredibly detailed. The sense of exploration is one of the game’s greatest strengths, with beautiful environments and secrets hidden around every corner. The freedom to explore Midgar and beyond provides a sense of constant discovery, while the visual and sound design truly immerses the player in this vibrant world. The soundtrack, composed by Nobuo Uematsu and other talented musicians, is a true gem. Reinterpretations of classic FFVII themes, mixed with new compositions, create an unforgettable listening experience. Each piece of music perfectly complements the moment in the game, whether during intense battles or in the most emotional scenes. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a game that not only lives up to the legacy of the original, but also elevates the experience to new heights. With a rich narrative, enhanced combat, a captivating open world, and stunning graphics, the game deserves every inch of its 10/10 rating. It is an essential experience for longtime fans and new players alike, further solidifying FFVII’s place as one of the greatest RPGs of all **** this game doesn’t win Game of the Year, I will never consider their opinions again.",10,2024-05-31,PLAYSTATION 5,user

I frequently forgot what the main plot is and what I should do next after I finish grinding minigames. The plot is super confusing. I didn't play the original but the last chapter is confusing as hell. WTF is happening here. Is Aerith OK? Why is Cloud appearing here and in the next second a different place? And why and what Zach is doing here suddenly? I don't even understand Zach's role and narratives in the whole game. I feel like the game is really bad at telling a good story. And I was questioning myself why I spent so much time playing this game to end up with a bad taste in my mouth. At this point, I am wondering why we need 3 games for ff7 at all. Can't we just do 1 remake and truncate all unnecessary parts and tell a good story?",7,2024-09-18,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Full of details, great characters, probably my favorite combat in the FF series, and an absurd amount of content that just keep giving and giving.

All that and I didn't mention the music and soundtrack, because those are on their own league and sit at the top, they elevate this game to a whole different level.

Diese Quests haben richtig schöne Storys in die hollywoodgleiche Hauptstory so reingewoben, dass sie einfach dazugehören.

Deimoose,"I played the original FFVII for the first time last year before delving into the Remake saga, and even without the baggage of nostalgic attachment, I am perpetually baffled by all the decisions they keep making with the story of this project. This remake project has been mishandled beyond belief all the new changes and additions to the story are made either for the sake of subversion or fundamentally misunderstanding what made the original story work to begin with. In regards, to the open world, it is bland, empty, and littered with repetitive Ubisoft-like objectives. Get a tower, open area, hit points of interests where you scan stuff, kill stuff, take pictures of stuff, rinse, and repeat for every area in the game. And despite the huge hub areas being huge and populated, it feels hollow, like they plastered the same NPCs everywhere to give the sense that people actually live in these locations when in reality it feels like some sort of hollow artificial tourist attraction. The developers stated that this game is 100 hours when in reality 70 out of those 100 hours consist of mind-numbingly boring side content and mini-games that serve no narrative purpose other than to pad out the game time. It was fun for an hour or two but when you make whole MAIN STORY chapters revolve around one minigame it becomes ridiculous. It's clear the SE want to milk these games for every penny they can get, and it's comical how badly people are eating it up. The side quests suffer from the same issue in remake in that they are all clear after thoughts since 99% of them are either fetch quests or kill quests. Extremely unmemorable and forgetful. For the few moments I still managed to enjoy during my playtime of Rebirth, it's incredible how much of that goodwill was washed away as my eyes glazed over playing through Chapter 14. I already deemed this overarching meta/multiverse plot as bad fanfiction after completing Remake, and Rebirth has only further cemented my belief that this story has gone completely off the rails and now all the writers can do is pander and hype up fan service moments in hope that the blind ff7 fanatics will love it. To conclude I want to say that In the process of Square Enix trying to replace the original with this ""remake"", I believe they have immortalized it. Years from now when this saga is complete, detached from the hype cycle and speculation, this remake trilogy will be forgotten and buried in most people's consciousness. It's a modern event with no lasting significance. To me, it's a traveling circus deemed to limp over the hill never to return to town. Eventually, all the hype and the social media ruckus will follow with it. And maybe then people can go back and experience the real FFVI for themselves because it is seriously an inreaching deep and emotional journey.",2,2024-09-15,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Each side quest either expands the world you are in or gives a member of the cast some solid character development. This is one of those games that I just could not put down. I sat down to play for a little bit and I looked and it was midnight already. I also loved the story and beats that they added for remake. The ending left a little bit too open ended for my taste, but I have faith in the FF7 remake crew that they will close it all up well.

vancityboy,"The end is Nigh. It sure is. I'm done. After spending many many hours trying to get thru this filler material that is most of the game... the final boss chapter that kills you without a chance is a joke and has deterred me from finishing this game and playing the third installment. well done guys. you just saved me $90. I thought this game was going to be quality and fun... it was painfully long, too much minigames and filler to call it fun. The interaction between characters was very awkward and as if it was written by a boy pretending to have female friends. Dialogue is painfully dull. I blame the translation but some things don’t translate and this game suffers for it. I tried to avoid the long drawn out battles near the end as I wanted to end this overhyped nostalgia. Your kidding yourself if you give this a 10. Yes visuals in cutscenes are 10 and look very expensive, yes, the environment is beautiful... the gameplay as repetitive and painfully drawn out combats mechanics and the characters are one dimensional. Cloud is a vanilla cookie with no personality, the girls are the only interesting characters and even then... they don't get much to work with.

Overall, it's a heartfelt tribute to the original.",9,2024-09-05,PLAYSTATION 5,user

The world is gorgeous and detailed, the characters modes of VII has brought to life in the best way possible, the voice acting, the story, the details, the cutscenes, everything rocks and very well done! The Chocobos are incredible and can fly, glide, climb, jump and sprint in different regions, they can fight with you and can be summoned during battle when requires are met. The combat is fantastic and allows you to switch between real time and throw some commands and super attacks into it, Soundtrack and arrangement is awesome too, The game is much much much bigger than the first one (FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE) and is a solid 10/10 to me NO MORE TO SAY CAUSE SPOILERS, GO ENJOY THE GAME!",10,2024-03-30,PLAYSTATION 5,user

ScafoGames,"Without delving into a full review, I can confidently say that Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is an absolute masterpiece. I can't recall a Final Fantasy title as outstanding since FFX. In terms of content, it's one of the most remarkable games I've ever played. The expansive world is complemented by exceptional gameplay and a captivating plot. While some parts could have been fine-tuned (perhaps benefiting more from subtraction than addition), the experience is elevated by an incredible soundtrack and by a remarkable technical achievement, undermined only by too little powerful hardware (PS5). It's hard to imagine what more one could ask for from a JRPG.",10,2024-09-01,PLAYSTATION 5,user
Sam_Wall_04,"The first half of my favorite game of all time, FFVII, has been remade in a stunning high fidelity remake via pt. 1&2. Both parts only cover the first 50% of the entire FFVII experience. Part 2 will be covering Kalm - The Forgotten Capital. Iconic scenes remade & reimagined are so beautiful on a 2k or 4k display. The lighting and shading looks good but there are some hiccups here and there. Some ugly textures and strange texture pop in sometimes. All are fairly forgivable. The frame pacing of the animations and cutscenes are very fluid, so even while playing with the 30fp graphics mode the experience was smooth throughout. Unfortunately the 60fps mode really scales down the image quality, but still enjoyable. All of which can be fairly forgiven. 8/10 for fidelity and performance. The gameplay consists of many different regions of the planet to explore, from grass plains & mountains, to jungles & vast canyons, & even the ocean. Each of these regions are huge and very beautiful looking areas to experience. Depending on the region the chocobos you ride will have different unique traits from one another Such as climbing, gliding around, and propelling themselves with water jets. There is plenty to do in each region of the planet and a 100% playthrough will take you a long time. Unfortunately while the exploration is in fact very fun, in terms of things to do it has a fetch quest & check list feel to them which could get redundant. Each of these regions have towns to explore and areas to pick up side quests. Players to challenge to the simple but effective queen's blood card game. The entire game is packed with many unique mini games. However some can feel frustrating with some poor controls. 8/10 for exploration gameplay. The combat is packed full. From many unique materia setups, synergy abilities, & a large variety of enemies and bosses to experience. Its an amazing 50/50 mix between rpg & action combat. Using the action combat to gain atb to use abilities and parry enemies, and combining elemental effective abilities & spells with pressure & stagger to deal a bunch of extra damage. You can use limit break which do a ton of damage, and summon materia to summon a beast that aids you in combat The fluid mix between rpg and action with a vast variety of strategies and setups to choose from, along with an immensely vast variety of enemies to choose from make combat very fun. 9/10 for combat. The continuation of this rewritten story for the FFVII Remake project has been fairly exciting, recapturing iconic moments in full hd with motion capture to captivate the impact of each scene. The new additions to this story have been overall thrilling for even a fan of the original, while staying consistent and faithful to the original plots. From start to finish each scene adds more life to these scenes and the characters to express more of the emotion. Each character shines very well with having their own fun personalities that get widely expanded upon as the story progresses. You can pursue relationships with each character to gain new synergy abilities in combat. 8/10 for narrative and characters. The OST of this game is a work of art. Over 400 new tracks for part 2 alone. Beautifully composed music that remakes the old memorable classics from the original game that captures the feel of every moment. While exploring the world you get this beautiful theme that smoothly transitions into a more hyped up version of the song while entering combat, to then going back to the slower theme of the open world. All of which makes for an incredible OST to truly captivate the player with each scene. A 10/10 for OST Composition. Truly a game worthy of praise, with some unfortunate clear downsides. Thankfully square has looked at certain issues and confirm they push to improve for the third and final entry of the FFVII Remake project. Which will be covering the last 50% of the entire FFVII experience. Overall a great game. 8.5/10 Overall.",8,2024-09-01,PLAYSTATION 5,user

antikmonke,Final Fantasy VII REBIRTH is a display of charm and passion that I have scarcly seen in the AAA gaming industry as of late. It blends humour and goofiness with serious and heartfelt character interactions and epic and multifaceted storytelling that provide a gripping experience.

Action animations at the speed of a sloth covered in molasses. NPCs that all look like they buy their clothes from JC Penny. Chadley. Gaping plot holes. Useless dodging cheap stunlock attacks.

İt is important because story did not finish and we are waiting for a next game to finish a story that wil probably take 4 years but it is ok if they really gonna do this like this game so whoever like this game PLEASE VOTE FOR GAME OF THE YEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",10,2024-08-29,PLAYSTATION 5,user

snapgacklepop,"I found this game pretty insufferable which is a shame. They did everything possible to put road blocks in front of you to slow down story progression. They took away the sense of urgency the original had and made the characters childish when they are meant to be 'saving the world. Instead of all the mini games they threw in to stop progression they should have just had fantastic optional side quests in the world. Serious side quests about the current crisis the game world is facing. Instead of generic fetch Quests and silly character Quests. The Witcher 3 had amazing side quests and have never understood why other games can't replicate this. This game had lots of potential but ended up a frustrating mess. The battle system is alright although it does start to feel repetitive and tedious as there are so many extra added boss battles. Collecting the summons just does ****. They could have been another side quest like in the original where you had to go through certain steps and get to certain locations to collect them. This time they are another very annoying mini game and very easy to find. This game is very pretty and when you start playing it, you get a sense of awe although that quickly starts to diminish as you work your way through the story and discover the slog you have to put yourself through. I really wanted to enjoy this game and thought it was going to be pretty epic as the remake was pretty good and had some extra added characters which were fine but unfortunately they really dropped the ball and ruined that in this game. It's a real shame. I really wish they just made an 100% exact remake down to absolutely everything from the original game. Then this could have been amazing on modern systems.",2,2024-08-28,PLAYSTATION 5,user

It tries to merge with multi-universe but they lack of ability to make this work well. 3) The so-called open world lacks of items and empty.

This game truly has my heart, I can say that this is my favourite game series of all time. I think everybody should give this a chance and see just how amazing FF7 is.

jamesT38,"I honestly don't know how this game is rated so high. I mean maybe if the game was in Japanese the tutorials would be better. But having never played FF7, I played the remake and thought everything was polished nicely. This game is just down right terrible at times. The lighting in caves just goes completely black for the first 50 ft in the cave, can't even see your character. In the remake you had to do like a pull up challenge this time it's sit ups but instead of using triangle circle blah blah they use all the trigger buttons knowing the controls get slightly harder to press every time. The combat simulator there's times where it'll steal your camera just to swollow your character with unblockable instead of allowing you to dodge it. They put some of the most obnoxious monsters together. 3 that stay underground the whole fight only doing red attacks to your characters. And you have to just get lucky to hit one with another character as it pops out. Or another where the AI is so freaking stupid you put something to sleep just for the AI to continue fighting it to wake it up. This game deserves like a **** open world aspect is like 3 activities that you just repeat for the 100+ hours of the game",6,2024-08-20,PLAYSTATION 5,user
Djawa,"Just finished a 70-hour run filled with nostalgia, wonder and, as anyone who has played the 1997 original, high expectations. The easy way would have been to just put a new skin on a beloved classic. What the team at Square Enix did was much more risky and I think it paid of. Notwithstanding the highly debated ending, I cannot recommend this game enough. The game manages to build on and extent the stories of all these beloved characters in way that kept me hooked. The world is beautifully crafted, the fighting system engaging and varied . The open world does run into the well known problem of a slightly repetitive overload of side content, but that does not change the fact that there has been no game this year that got me so invested into both the world and its characters. There is nothing more beautiful than putting down your controller and finding out tis 4AM and you have been playing for 6 hours straight.

The open world could have been exploited better too but the world in itself is pretty and pleasant to look at so it's fine. 10/10 for the story and its delivery, least 1 for some little defaults about the game aside of it.

Im not without complaints, i wanted more dialogue, more chit chat, and more dialogue options. I wanted the party to talk while exploring and overall more characterization and options for it. Certain parts of it were clunky like the box throwing and traversal. The fact chocobos and your character has no jump button while traversing is annoying as hell, and navigation/exploration left something to be desired.

Gennerik,"I really wanted to love this game, and I looked forward to playing it, but I feel let down. The biggest strike against FF7 Rebirthfor me is the sacrifice of fun for the sake of realism. The game is gorgeous, and the world is huge, but there's not a sense of wonder or benefit for exploring. There's so little to do or find between the points of interest that are revealed by the towers, it's just boring. And riding a chocobo feels every bit as jolting and jostling as you can imagine (and while not as bad as FFX, controls terribly), with the constant stuttering as you travel over every terrain feature. So many of the open world mini games revolve around you moving so slowly and cautiously that it just isn't fun. But it is realistic.... The near- constant chattering of MAI and the frequent interruptions of Chadley keep pulling me back from any sort of immersion, and then if you turn off the voices and just read all the text, you can't speed anything up because the game won't let you skip to the next text until the current one is being spoken is complete. Everything just feels really padded and slow, and without the immersion, it drags on. Beyond the realism **** the fun from the game, there are so many other things that just don't seem to be done right. Combat is just a slog. Unless you're way over-leveled, even basic enemy combat takes way too long. I turned it to Easy difficulty just to make the fights shorter. Having to stagger enemies just to do any meaningful damage is a terrible design decision that adds little beyond time to battles. Almost every aspect of the game feels like it's been done better (and in many cases, frequently) by other games. Combat is a weird turn-base/action hybrid that doesn't flow well. Open world exploration is so much better in so many games (Zelda, Genshin Impact, Stellar Blade, Elden Ring, to name a few). Everything feels like there's a mini-game attached to it, and it's almost more like a tech demo than a logical sequence of games. Also, not having a mini-map for an exploration game is dumb (if I can just open up the map, why make it difficult and include extra steps?) Also, the inclusion of so many more materia to facilitate the action aspect of the game without any increase in materia slots seems a bad design. I feel that really the two things going for the game are the graphics (incredible!) and the updated story (I don't mind the changes, though I wish Sephiroth wasn't as omnipresent as he is). I'm not done with the game, but I feel like I'm having to force myself to play it way to much of the time to recommend it.",4,2024-08-06,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Flinnbo,"The good: // The variety of chocobos are fun to experience // The music is fantastic // The combat can be fun, especially if you're willing to put the effort in to trying different things // The world can be very beautiful at times // Many of the mini games are really enjoyable ------- The neutral: // The story is fine, if a little confusing at parts. I lost track of what was going on a few times because we'd be going off on some boring side tangent // The graphics can look really bad at times, like some of the textures shocked me with how low quality they looked. This may be because I'm playing in high FPS mode though ---------- The bad: // Considering that this is one of the most expensive games I've ever bought, the following things really sting: // I really wanted to give this game the benefit of the doubt, but two things happened in relatively quick succession at which point I couldn't stop myself from writing this review: // The first was a moment in which I had to really slowly move some crates in order to uncover a code for a door. They weren't even spread out or anything, they were right next to each other, and it still took what felt like a few incredibly pointless minutes. // The second was a ""mini game"" in which I literally had to just walk behind some guys moving at a crawl. There was an option to shove one to make him move faster, but in reality this did nothing because you'd have to wait for the group to catch up anyway. // These are just two examples out of so many in the game which just straight up don't respect your time at all. And it just makes me wonder why the hell they put this stuff in the game, just to make it longer!? Even without it, it would be a really long game. // And that's one of the biggest problems with this game, it doesn't respect your time, it just fills it with boring useless stuff to do. // Another example is the open world segments. Sadly, they decided to follow the ubisoft formula for this game. i.e. Go to a tower to uncover some things on the map, then do those things on the map, rinse and repeat. Which wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if the things to do on the map were interesting or rewarding. But let's look at a couple of things you'll be doing over, and over, and over: // Pressing triangle 3 times to ""analyse"" something. And I'm not saying that each time the pattern will be different, no not at all, it will be the exact same pattern every time. Why are they wasting my time, why can't I just press a button once? In fact why even have this feature in the game at all? It's not fun // Climbing towers to uncover part of the map. By the way climbing in this game is painful and you guessed it... boring. Holdthe analogue stick in the direction of the next handhold and (if you're lucky) cloud will jump to it. Every now and then a tower will have a ""puzzle"" where the handholds are in a slightly different location. This would all be fine if they just made climbing a bit more engaging, but no it's just another boring thing that doesn't need to be in the game. // Another big downside about this game is that most things you do feel completely inconsequential. // Sometimes you'll find a materia lying around and get excited that it's something new to try, and most of the time it's something you already have or just don't care about. // There's a crafting system which you can basically just ignore without any consequence. // You can go looking off the beaten path for treasure chests, only to find they contain a laughable amount of money (you probably won't use) or an item (you probably won't use). // The leveling up system does nothing to make me feel excited. You unlock points at a painfully slow rate and then spend them on little stat increases that you don't really notice, or new teamwork abilities which you'll probably barely use unless you're very deliberately trying to. It's not until the last few nodes where it begins to feel vaguely worth your time. // You have relationships with each character although I'm yet to see any consequence to any of that.",5,2024-08-05,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the rebirth for the traditional rpg. It's been a long time since I felt this feeling of adventure in a videogame, it has rekindled a flame within me that I thought long gone. Profound rpg mechanics and customization, hybrid combat that combines action and strategic decisions. Do not let this opportunity of meeting again your inner child be missed.

I've never felt so empty after finishing a game and I'm usually someone who can easily move on to another game, but THIS game made me feel something special.

strif3,"What an incredible game ! Final Fantasy 7 rebirth will provide you so much content that you will be overwhelmed with ! I have played an 100 hours without seeing it. The gameplay is dynamic and still in the shape of an old final fantasy game with the old ATB system. You can find a really deep experience with it and understanding the different mechanics inside is really playful. The story pays a true homage to original game and allows a new reading behind it. Even if sometimes it can be a little bit confusing... But what a pleasure to be able to rediscovered the places of the PS1 version in an actual 3D render world !! So incredible, the game do an incredible work at recreating this aura so unique to the old game with plenty of mini games (it can be a little painful for some people) and a lot second story's with cinematic inside ! The side quest are so much better than in Final Fantasy 7 Remake it is really enjoyable to do and motivating cause the rewards have a real impact on your progression through the game. This apply also to the objectives in the open world who at first seems to me like an easiness like many open worlds do nowadays but after a few hours I discovered myself being really invest in it mainly because of rewards it provides you who has a real impact on your scaling an overall progression into the game. Also the objectives are really built with an intelligent vision who invite's you to discovered all the little secrets inside every zone. Somehow there are some downfalls to this game also. The textures on a lot of environments are not that good for a game that release in 2024. The mini games inside it are sometimes a little bit frustrating when you start invest yourself in it (this those not apply to all of them queen's blood , chocobo racing and fort condor game are really great) and the open worlds parts are sometimes fill with invisible wall that restrict you from taking action when you need it. Same apply to the chocobo you use in Gongaga region who's really frustrating using if you miss the right path to go to your destination. This kinda ruin the open world experience who's really a big part of the original game and the real promise of this one. Expect that the game is really good without bugs and the loading times are inexistant. The game conclude with a powerful ending who I'm pretty sure satisfied all the fan's of the series with cinematic looking like an hoolywood production. I will let you see by yourself !",9,2024-07-23,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Plays like a dream, meticulous cinematography and character writing, gives you the OPTION to do hundred+ of hours of sidequests and map exploring IF you WANT to. I can't take any single person rating below an 8 seriously lol like you don't always need to be the contrarian. Best made game out of the entire Square Enix catalog. Original VII is the Beatles of JRPG but bro you can not tell me that in 2024 you have a ""better"" time playing that if nostalgia isn't driving it.

AdoMobA,"Pros - the gameplay feels even better than the Remake - way larger build variety thanks to the 8-slot armors - old playable characters have new mechanics while the new add even more gameplay variety - voice acting is perfect, especially Tifa and Barret - music is always scene appropriate with some incredible callbacks - the world is massive and the way it is interconnected gives me so much hope for Part 3 - the content to price ratio is crazy for this game // Cons - not a fan of having to increase my limit break level in each and every combat to get access to the actually good ones - the lack of materia loadouts makes chapters where you change between two parties annoying (Chapter 13 on Hard had me spending more time in the equipment menu than actually playing the game) - the most memorable side-quest in the game is the chicken quest in Gongaga, not because it's good but because it is annoying - the navigation in Gongaga **** // Where Remake surprised, Rebirth delivers twice as hard. I was expecting a solid game and I got way more than I bargained for. Everything, from the combat to the exploration is better here than it was in Remake which makes me beyond excited for Part 3. Combat is better than ever. Taking a lesson from Intergrade, Cloud, Tifa and Yuffie give your party crazy amounts of air combos allowing the flying enemies not to ****. Then you add the synergy abilities. Then you add new defensive options like counterfire. And you crown it with a perfect parry system that can keep you completely unharmed if you are good. Genuinely crazy how much this game improves on Remake. The world is way bigger with side activities that unlock more materia and armor options for your characters. When the world completely opens in the later chapters I was floored by just how well connected everything was. And while there are some misses, like Gongaga thanks to its vertical navigation, the world is fun to explore and the enemies are fun to engage. A highlight of the game would be Golden Saucer and the myriad activities that unlocks. From combat challenges, cards and arcade games, Golden Saucer is a game within a game. Truly fantastic. One of my complaints would be the lack **** loadout system. The constant need to fiddle with my materia setups is not a bad thing in itself. However, the need to completely redo a character setup because the game gives you only TWO First Strike materia and TWO ATB Boosts is crazy. Some of the later chapters had me sitting in the menus for tens of minutes at a time because the story would split my party and force me to play as different setups every thirty minutes. Overall I was surprised by just how much I got out of Rebirth. While it is not a perfect experience, it does so much right that I can overlook the minor blemishes. Can't wait for the next game.",9,2024-07-19,PLAYSTATION 5,user

The music is amazing, so many tracks just hit you in the feels. The mini games are many but at least they are varied and interesting on their own. My advice to new players is just focus on the story first and don't burn yourself on the side stuff, you can always comeback to do them later whenever you feel like. The pacing felt a lot better if you just flow along with the story. My only complaint is Chadley being a bit too annoying, he really needs to tone down in part 3.",10,2024-07-18,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Unbreakable971,"Square Enix did something we all thought it was impossible to do : creating a JRPG in 2024 with the same ambition and the same gigantic scope that the ones we used to have during the 90's. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a monumental game that flirts with the unreasonable. He doesn’t do everything right. He is sometimes clumsy, but everything he tries aims to nourish the voluntary ambivalence of his adventure. So we laugh, we cry, we breathe, we have fun. We take turns saving the world and participating in different trivial activities. The game carries us from one state to another, always keen to entertain us in order to forget for a while the harshness of its story, and to better devastate us when it decides to remind us of the sad reality of the world of Gaia .",10,2024-07-13,PLAYSTATION 5,user

OrbMonky,"I strived really hard to find something of value in Rebirth. I enjoyed the OG, I enjoyed Remake. This feels like a deliberate mockery of both of those games and the player with several fourth wall breaking ""Yeah, we're insulting you, player. You'll keep playing anyways."" moments that felt like a surreal Andy Kaufman ""Is the audience self aware enough to clock what just happened?"" comedy bit where you're the butt of the joke. I award one point because the main cast voice actors, minus Nanaki (the voice actor was fine doing Red XIII but completely whiffed on the transition to Nanaki, which was so stunningly bad I had to headcanon it as Red XIII retiring and a literal 8 year old that looks like an animal joined the party), otherwise nailed it. That was the one good thing I could find. The OST, the bizarre disjointed yet also copy paste open world, the unnecessary forced in half baked systems (not exclusive to but definitely including the horde of borderline torturous minigames), the anime filler arc storyline, the reocurring overused insufferable characters that in some cases are killed over and over and keep coming back... all encrusting a half baked attempt at what could have been a decent plot. It's a turd caked in turds swirling amongst other turds with 9/10 main cast voice acting. The people responsible for it should be fired and blacklisted. They either do not care to produce quality, or cannot tell the difference, and either is not sustainable by me as a fan of the franchise, nor Square as a company that ostensibly wants to keep selling games to me. If I could refund it, I would, and I won't be buying anything else from them unless this trash heap is burned down and reworked for free and they also nail the final one at least to the quality that Remake had. If I had to put a tag line I would say it feels like the makers of modern Yakuza games showed up at the wrong studio and were let in and rewrote and trashed the game for a laugh and people were too dense to catch it.",1,2024-07-12,PLAYSTATION 5,user

The combat is a beautiful evolution on Remake, with boss battles that left me breathless. The minigames were fun and the right balance of challenge and accessibility.

DB9292,"FF7 Rebirth is phenomenal. The first installment was great but devs really went above and beyond with Rebirth. The already excellent real time combat has been tightened and polished beyond its predecessor and the emphasis on customization and combo skills between different party members further reinforces its overarching theme of building character relationships. Exploration is certainly not mind blowingly innovative but its reasonably fun and manages to prevent backtracking and side content from feeling painful or stale, the only exception being the annoying dialogue pop ins from chadley, if they cut those back or allow more skipping all would be golden. The relationship building mechanic is pretty straightforward but offers depth to characters back stories thar is genuinely rewarding to discover, and balancing things out to get the ""dates"" that you desire is pretty straightforward if you desire to manipulate it. Other than the combat the character interation and acting is where the game really shines. Seeing Tifa and Aerith subtly struggle for Clouds affections in cinematic high def is truly a joy for players old and new, and diving into each characters individual backstories while they interact and get to know eachother is equally fun. As a huge fan of the original plot I admit that going into the game i was worried about how much ""kingdom hearts"" and history revising would injected into things but the writers managed to keep these elements minimal, and frankly, very engaging, I was actually surprised that all changes managed to stay minimal and suprisigly enriching to the original plot, and i genuinely mean that from the bottom of my heart, the more the intentions of the rewrites became clear the more riveted I became, very rare for me, as with most remakes i hate this sort of thing, but they did a genuinely good job and respected all major plot points and very clearly respected the source material, very well done! Lastly I was pleased that the devs managed to pack this section of the FF7 story full of all of the mini games and side content that it was known for plus many more, while balancing all of the fun and drama of the overarching plot again, going above and beyond. All in all, one of the best gaming experiences Ive ever had in spite of minimal repetitiveness and an annoying ""navi like"" side character, Id give it a 9 but im going for 10 to balance out some obvious salty review bomb of 0 (ridiculous people).

There's so many different strategies to try with different characters and I love how every character gets their shine now. In Remake I mostly only wanted to use Cloud or Tifa with Barret and Aerith solely for backup/healing but now Aerith and Barret are my faves to use along with Yuffie. Then I went and played hard mode and this just made me love the game even more. The battles were so exciting, the MP management really had me thinking hard and then in the later chapters especially when you're down to your last 3000hp and 14mp and finally beat one boss then a next one appears and you just have to beat them, seeing your whole team use their limit team to get it done...just wow.

vryzze,"Disclaimer He jugado a distintos FF, empezando por el X, que sería mi juego fetiche. Sin embargo, no jugué al FF VII en su momento, por lo que el factor nostalgia no suma para mi en esta entrega. Exploración A pesar de que los mapas son muy extensos, no se incita ni se recompensa la exploración. Los escenarios son muy planos y apenas cuentan con zonas diferenciadas e interesantes. No hay recompensa alguna por explorar: lo único que consigues son cofres amarillos con objetos básicos y comunes que se pueden fabricar o comprar con facilidad. El hecho de que las armas se encuentren directamente según avanzas en la historia suma en la misma dirección, ya que no motiva ni recompensa la exploración. Por último, los eventos que podemos encontrar en cada zona son siempre los mismos: subir a una torre (siempre idéntica) para revelar el mapa, escanear un lago para obtener recursos… terriblemente plano. Esto hace que, a pesar de las diferencias estéticas, el juego se reduzca a repetir lo mismo en cada mapa una y otra vez… En el primer mapa resulta interesante, pero al poco tiempo se vuelve muy aburrido. Ritmo El ritmo del juego se siente innecesariamente lento. Las animaciones se ejecutan muy despacio, interrumpiendo constantemente el fluir del juego. Cada vez que interaccionas con algún elemento el juego se bloquea para ejecutar una animación básica que además, una vez que se completa, **** en torno a un segundo más en devolver el control del juego. Esto sucede cada vez que aparece un título, que exploras alguna zona, que consigues puntos, … es decir, con mucha (demasiada) frecuencia. Ya no digamos cuando se corta completamente la acción para que el niño pesado te cuente que acabas de analizar un lago (como si no lo supieras ya). Minijuegos Entiendo que es una parte del lore y que se hereda del FF original pero… este juego es una pesadilla de los minijuegos. Uno hace gracia, dos están bien, diez se hacen pesados, pero… resulta que la mitad del juego se basa en realizar minijuegos absurdos, cada uno de los cuales tiene su dinámica, sus controles… y su nulo interés. En muchas ocasiones parece que estás jugando a uno de estos recopilatorios de la MegaDrive… Para mi, esta es la peor parte del juego, ya que detesto que me hagan perder el tiempo, y estos minijuegos no aportan absolutamente nada. Combate El combate es interesante, dinámico y bastante divertido, además de visualmente impactante. Quizás un poco complejo al principio, ya que cuenta con muchas opciones como las acciones combinadas, pero resulta interesante. Mi punto negativo aquí sería la poca solidez del parry y de las esquivas, que en ocasiones son un poco frustrantes, aunque no suele tener demasiado interés. El hecho de poder jugar con 3 personajes al mismo tiempo y poder variarlos en casi cualquier momento está muy bien. También considero positivo que en ocasiones te fuerce a usar ciertos grupos, evitando que te acomodes en exceso. En este sentido, estaría bien una forma de guardar configuraciones de materias, ya que a veces te ves obligado a modificarlas por uno de estos cambios forzados de grupo y pierdes mucho tiempo para recuperar tu configuración principal después. Historia La historia está muy bien, interesante y bastante bien ligada. Las cinemáticas también son atractivas. Ligado con los minijuegos, me sobran las zonas en las que lo único que debes hacer son minijuegos… ya que creo que no aportan absolutamente nada a la trama. Resumen El juego es interesante: buena historia, nostalgia, buen combate, gráficos atractivos… pero pierde bastante debido a las animaciones y los minijuegos, que rompen el ritmo sin aportar nada a cambio. La exploración también podría mejorarse con recompensas más relevantes.",7,2024-07-08,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Multiversal1994,"One of the best games I've played in recent years. Incredible story telling that expands upon the original story and adds alot more depth to the characters, locations, world. -Main story quest is fantastic and has breathed new life into the story. -Side quests are all Incredible, a huge range of things to do, great stories attached to the side quests and a plethora of different styles of gameplay attached to them. -Mini-games, there is lots and lots of mini-games just like in the original title but with lots more new ones added, all incredibly well polished and lots of fun, there are a couple frustrating ones(3D brawler I'm looking at you) but all in all they are tons of fun, and all completely optional, if you don't want to play the minigames you don't have to, you can just focus on the main story. -Combat is where this game truly shines especially in Dynamic/Hard mode, the battle system has so much depth and with the new characters added provided alot more options for gameplay, there is alot of new and reoccurring materia to help build your characters the way you want them and with 7 different characters to put into your 3 man party there is plenty of different combinations to use to keep the fight interesting. -Music, the music in this game is incredible, building off the incredible groundwork laid by the amazing Nobuo Uematsu the music has evolved to even greater heights and alot of the new tracks are absolutely stunning. -Graphics, Graphically the game isn't as good as Remake due to the size of the world and the use of world lighting instead of individually placed lights, and at times the lighting will slightly look goofy on the characters (mainly during elevators/scene transitions) but dont let this detract you from the game, it still looks incredible. -time of completion, to complete my first playthrough, doing all side quests, mainstory, minigames, it took 130hours.

This is a GRIND if you are going for platinum, but the game is very forgiving regarding missables.

From hunting Chocobos to slaughtering monsters, the gameplay loop is satisfying and fun. The myriad of mini games may be off-putting to some but I delighted in each Queens Blood or Chocobo race win.

onewingedangel3,"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth improves on the first instalment in the remake trilogy in many ways, story, linearity, gameplay, music, exploration etc. The explorable locations in the map in Rebirth are massive. The moment I opened the doors from Kalm, I was greeted with the beautiful vista of the Grasslands and was given a feeling that I have not felt since leaving Midgar in the original, but unlike the original game which had an overworld map that was empty and small, the Grasslands is expansive and filled with so much to do. And from there, every region is huge and satisfying to explore. The story for the most part follows the original in its main story beats but differs slightly in certain places and differs greatly a the start and right at the end. The music is incredible and packed with 400 songs! Suzuki and Hamauzu cooked the OST for this game. Overall, while not perfect and has some flaws here and theres such as some graphical dips in performance mode and not landing certain iconic moments as well as the they were done in the original game, this game is still an incredible roller coaster of a ride and just like how I felt like when I played the original, it is an unforgettable experience.",10,2024-07-06,PLAYSTATION 5,user

A lot of these complaints generally pick up on the trend that some may remember from the first game of this 'Remake' series, and I believe in the end it will pay off, and while the endings are very much confusing, I believe that makes it a whole lot more interesting, especially since it really leaves the player to question whether or not some things will happen or not. Interestingly, for the most part, Rebirth follows the original's story quite well, with a few glaring exceptions (i.e. how Cid is met).

Kento500,"Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth es el juego que más me ha impactado en mi vida. Un historia realmente increible, seria, cómica, etc... una jugabilidad realmente entretenida y divertida. Muchisimos minijuegos divertidos, muchas horas de juego para perderte en su mundo. Un mundo muy vivo que te envuelve con cada personaje, como si estuvieses adentro. El sistema de afinidad es una locura, también ayuda muchisimo en lo que he escrito anteriormente. El diseño de niveles un lujo. Como JRPG tiene varias armas, las materias aportan muchisimo para luchar con todos los tipos de enemigos, aprovechando sus debilidades elementales, etc... la paleta de habilidades que necesitas mejorarlo en el trayecto del juego para descubrir nuevas habilidades y mejoras, cada vez más grandioso, para un JRPG es perfecto. Y como juego hibrido de RPG por turnos y acción en tiempo real, perfeccionaron lo anterior visto del primer remake, gracias a las habilidades energicas/sincronizadas. Las bandas sonoras son un lujo, obra maestras, disfruté al máximo cada banda sonora con la intensidad del volúmen en alto, un deleite. La historia se mantiene bien y esta constantemente equilibrada de acción, comedia, suspenso, etc... es entretenida y divertida en todo el trayecto del juego. Acá las misiones secundarias son muy buenas, no son muchas, algunas aportan mucho a la historia, a su mundo. Hubo una gran evolución a comparación del remake parte 1, mejoraron bastante. El FF7 Rebirth parece una segunda entrega en toda regla. y como remake, para mi, es perfecto. Con este juego van a disfrutar los fans de la saga y los nuevos jugadores, te hará llorar de lo grandioso que es. porque si, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth es la definición de grandioso en toda regla, lo perfecto que es en casi todos sus apartados. En el apartado visual, apartado sonoro(banda sonora,etc...), gameplay, lore, desarrollo,etc... Por último, El FINAL del juego, uff, sencillamente es cine, es arte puro, una obra maestra. Sin más que decir de este juego infravalorado que se merece que más gente lo juegue, espero con muchisimas ganas la tercera parte. Es el juego que más espero en mi vida. Gracias por leer hasta acá y suerte con lo que hagas. Fácilmente es el GOTY del 2024, no hay rival para tremenda obra maestra.",10,2024-06-04,PLAYSTATION 5,user
FrancisWoodly,"Overall I really liked FF7 Rebirth BUT there were 2 things I really disliked here! 1st is the huge ammount of mini games in the first part of the game! One or two mini games as part of an quest would be ok for me but there are hours of forced mini game parts threw the first part of the game which is just too much for my taste! Just saying Costa Del Sol! The 2nd thing was the technical performance even after the first couple of patches! Blurry and unsharp textures, low FPS, no matter if you´re in the quality or performance mode. I just hated it to play such an masterpiece in 2024 on PS5 with bad technical performance.Otherwise the game would have been an 9-9,5 for me…",8,2024-07-03,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Many major story points not hit the same AT ALL as the OG, and not just because I already know what happens, but because of strange changes they made. I dislike the remixed music, the battle gameplay is incredibly tedious, and enemies have too much hp.

Lionheartjsg,"As of yesterday i finally got platinum for this game after 195 hrs. I now feel comfortable leaving my full review. FF7 Rebirth is truly an amazing game start to finish. Plenty of side content including oddjobs, collectibles, legendary enemies, mini games, battle arenas you name it. In the end all of these things reward you for completion with side story, powerful items, materia or equipment. The most important thing is…ITS ALL OPTIONAL. The soundtrack is second to none, they spared no expense and it shows the variety and orchestral arrangements absolutely blew me away. I never had a game’s musicgive me a physical reaction before. Hearing the cosmo canyon theme for the first time brought tears to my **** and don’t even get me started on queens blood or the gold saucer. Absolute PERFECTION. Hard mode playthrough was intense as advertised but it forces you to learn your characters strengths and weaknesses. The VR challenges really bring this out but,defeating a boss on hard just feels so rewarding. Overall I gave this game a 10 because i never invested this much time into a single player game before. The smile never left my face while playing it and now i’m kinda sad its over. But now we waitfor part 3.",10,2024-06-23,PLAYSTATION 5,user

The excessive amount of new, nonsensical minigames (most of which I don't care for or find frustrating) that's often mandated in the story progression pads the experience and open world bloat instead of fetch quests or poor pacing this time.

DrSiko,"I gave the first game a 7 despite being long awaited and was magnificent to see our beloved game and characters in 3D with high quality graphics. This one? I am generous to give it 5. The positives are the open world map which shows the power of Unreal Engine and what could be done with it, the side quests are somewhat more polished and has some character compared to the dreadful ones in the first game, but not that good either, and the combat is somewhat fun. Yuffie was a cool and fun character to both play and watch, and the backstory of the characters is more fleshed with flashbacks about their past. However, the game didn't make me very attached to either the story or the same passion to play. This can be expected as this game comes in the middle where you are already being introduced to the main characters and the whole story and nothing to really add but a series of fights which is none is memorable. The game felt like an anime. They dropped the ball on the ""dark"" aspects with a world map which is too bright and characters who are too cheerful, compared to the original game. While the ""Remake"" game was cheesy, but it was entertaining at times. ""Rebirth"" was just cringe. Hojo's constant dumb maniac laughs, Rufus's edgy character and the very cringy encounter with the party at an arena (really?) and Shinra's leaders' eccentric behavior was too much embarrassing at times. If it wasn't for the fanbase of FF7 and Tifa's precious assets, this game would be treated like the rest of lastest FF games, totally forgettable. Oh and the whispers, asinine.",5,2024-06-18,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Karolina001,"I love this game and absolutely recommend it to everyone that is new to final fantasy and to all veterans who are open to some changes and don't expect an exact copy of the original game. I hope the next game will be an open world game too but with some improvements. - The word is beautiful and have a lot of visualty variety in the regions, tons of activities but just not enough enemy variety. More hidden treasures and stuff/chests/loot lying around would be cool to give us a reason to explore every corner on our own - I'm a big fan of crafting and looting and grinding so I'm happy there isaat least a small crafting system. - you can even buy Armor for your chocobo, this is a small but very cool addition - Combat system has it positives as negatives but all in all it's good, similar to remake with some upgrades like new skills you can perform together with your party members - I wish there would be a custom difficulty mode. More options, or at least there should be a possibility to turn the enemy scaling on on easy mode and on normal mode. - A lot of activities and side quest and believe me the quests are so much better than in remake, I hated them in the last game. - Combat challenges and combat Symulator, I'm a fan so there could be more of them. - I normally don't like mini games like fort condor and similar but the new card game is pretty cool. - I miss some dungeons to explore with some minibosses and special loot and rewards. - Story is good with some very cool sequences but sometimes story is a little confusing and it feels like the developers would assume everyone have played the original game - Not a fan of the new Weapon modifications system, bcs you are forced into specific upgrades and you can't choose which you would like to have. - It feels like everything is very slow, the limit bar fills so slowly, the atb from characters you don't control seems don't to fill at all, besides of that sometimes the characters you don't control don't fight at all, they are just standing there. If you don't control cloud, sometimes he is just blocking,he's ddoing nothing else thewhole time. so the AI could be much better. - Forced party members squad. The most of the time in theopen world you can choose your party but there are a lot of story parts where you're forced to specific party. It can be very annoying, bcs then you have to switch between materias aso. For example Tifa is my healer, If the game force me to switch Tifa to barret I have no healer anymore so I have to switch the materia between them or if they take Aerith away I have no magic fighter anymore so switch Materia would be necessary. So it doesn't solve the problem to just give everyone good materia bcs it depends who will be taken away and who will be on my party - Forced gameplay parts where you have to play a different character (don't want to spoil to much) All in all it's not a perfect game but it's really really good. If you like open world games with a lot of minigames and side quests and other activities. You can have a lot of fun with it. How long depends on your playstyle. I'm doing everything and grind a little bit for materials and exp so I'm already over 200hours at my first playtrough and I'm not even done and I'm NOT a trophy hunter.",9,2024-06-08,PLAYSTATION 5,user

I was so sceptical about this game and how it would look in comparison to the original, since the original is so big and perfect but I can say I am amazed with Rebirth. The game is huuuuge and the world is so big and beautiful, graphics are impressive, gameplay is polished to maximum and the story is great. The only thing that is somehow downgrading the game is too many (stupid) minigames and quests that are forcing you to explore the world but are very boring because they are all the same in every region. Instead it would be better if the game is a little harder so you are forced to get stronger by yourself and with many more secrets to explore by yourself, like in the original. And of course, instead of a million stupid quests they could've made one big game (all three parts) at once. BUT, the game is perfect and you should play it ASAP!

alanwaketan,本作优缺点明显，先说优点。剧情演出爽，尤其是爱丽丝的部分让我这个蒂法党都沦陷了，No Promises to Keep单曲循环，Cloud到底在第三部要怎么找到和拯救爱丽丝啊，心急如焚！战斗体验又拔高了，合体技+合体动作爽。大地图中规中矩算是个合格的开放世界。但优点就这么多，剩下就要开喷了。作为一款2025年的游戏，重生已经完全落伍甚至有点不好玩儿。在手游大行其道的今天，一个3A游戏应该着重强调玩家无法通过手游体验的内容，但重生却在大量强调小游戏，一些手游上能获得更好体验的内容，实在是让人味同嚼蜡。这导致光彩夺目的主线被小游戏支线们拆得支零破碎，体验糟糕。我相信只看主线剧情视频通关的云玩家体验应该远好于正版玩家，又一个迫害正版玩家的游戏。然后制作组还塞了旧时代JRPG的负反馈机制，即缺省搞坏结局以及断档式难度的最终boss战，试图刺激玩家来重复游玩。再次重申在手游冲击下，玩家早就习惯各种宝宝巴士般引导，这种无聊且恶意的负反馈只会让我想摔手柄，比如约会任务一开门是条狗，比如打牌最后一战，比如那个又臭又长的最终迷宫，再比如boss战要全员一起上逼着我练所有角色。千言万语汇作一句话，只玩主线就好了。,9,2025-02-25,PLAYSTATION 5,user

I was a little uncertain how I felt about some plot points a year ago, but a year later I feel really happy to have this title be a reality. It’s the best battle system in a Final Fantasy game probably since the PS1 era. It’s well adapted to modern gaming yet still retains the classic turn based play style.

SKSUND,"An absolute must-play for all FF7 fans old and new alike a simply superb game in its scope and magnitude. Rebirth faithfully recreates the world of Gaia in exquisite detail (as of course was the case for Remake), whilst simultaneously bringing the beloved cast to life with modern era graphics. The combat system incorporates a myriad of various strategies and is rewarding, engaging and thrilling whether you are an experienced action combat oriented gamer or a novice. With so much variety, the system does a great job in encouraging players to experiment with different play styles. From a graphical viewpoint the main cast and environments look spectacularly detailed, with my personal favourites being Nibelheim, Gongaga, The Gold Saucer, The Temple of the Ancients and The Forgotten Capital. The main story is faithfully recreated with some minor alterations along the way. The expansion of lore with respect to Gongaga, the Gi Tribe and the Cetra is very well executed and fills in some blanks from the original FF7 in a satisfactory manner. Aside from the main storyline, there are many side quests to complete along with battle simulation challenges aswell as a hard mode which ramps up difficulty considerably, when starting a new playthrough. The in game menus are logically presented and fairly easy to navigate through. The voice acting is spot on, in particular Britt Baron (Tifa), Cody Christian (Cloud), John Bentley (Barret) & Paul Tinto (Cait Sith) are exemplary. The only cons I would mention are open world navigation can be sketchy and frustrating at times aswell as a few mainline story sequences being cumbersome whereby the player is forced to navigate at a slow pace. However these minor issues are overshadowed by what is an absolutely brilliant overall package. In my opinion, Rebirth should have won the Game of The Year award hands down. In closing, you will not be disappointed with this purchase. PS, Tifa is absolutely ravishing, so fans will be delighted (I'm biased, I admit. That and she is my favourite character).",10,2025-02-12,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Her sidequest forces you to play the card game, then having you be the chocobo race champion. They also lock 1 of her glove behind minigame.

Toast4001,"The sheer scale and brilliance of execution deserves a 10 in my book. Rebirth cleverly builds on the combat system introduced in FFVII Remake and Intergrade and delivers seven playable characters with unique and interesting play styles (not even counting Zack and Sephiroth). The mini-games are a joy, I liked playing Queen’s Blood as much as the main game. Costa del Sol filled me with nostalgia for those golden years of video games where it seemed like every game was set on a tropical beach. My hope for the final game in the trilogy is that it will address some of the game’s shortfalls, namely the movement mechanics. At times, the auto-jumping and chocobo mechanics were frustrating, feeling lumpy. However the freedom of movement exceeded FFVII Remake by far. I also hope for more customisation options, by now we are getting a bit used to seeing Cloud, Barret, Tifa and Aerith in the same outfits. It would be nice to visually see equipped items, other than weapons and materials.

criticalgamer,"Yet another poor cashgrab entry for the Final Fantasy series, an ongoing experiment in exactly how bad of an experience you can make and still sell copies by Square Enix. FF7 rebirth somehow manages to take an even bigger step back from FF7 remake by adding in even more time wasters and gutting the story. Character VA sound like its their first time and have no guidance. Square has removed any actual decent gameplay and has replaced it all with minigames and unnecessary grinding. On top of that this game seems to be infected with the woke mind virus with the changes to Aerith's identity, completely dumpstering her in an attempted to pander. The OST sound likes something you would find on the epic asset store and game is frequently buggy and crashes. All changes made to the combat system were for the worse. I would say I can't believe they chopped 1 game up into three separate $70 purchases (plus DLC), but its Square Enix so I am not surprised.

Feriatus,"It pains me to say this, but Final Fantasy VII Rebirth left me thoroughly disappointed. What could have been an exciting continuation of the first part instead feels like an unnecessary expansion—similar to when they stretched The Hobbit into three movies. It’s just too much of too little. To be fair, there are some bright spots. The combat system is genuinely fun, and the Queen’s Blood card game adds a cool twist. But unfortunately, the rest of the game falls flat. The story is paper-thin. If you boiled it down, there’s maybe 10 minutes of actual worthwhile content. The level design feels dated. And the side quests—don’t get me started. They’re repetitive and boring, more of a slog than a joy. Then there are the mini-games. They were quirky and fun back in the 90s, but here, they just feel frustrating and dated. What might’ve been charming decades ago now just feels like a forced distraction. I liked the first part because of nostalgia, but that’s exactly what this sequel relies on—and it’s not enough.

The characters, from mannerisms to voice acting are superb across the board; also, this game has a lot of great, fun sidequests (better than remake in that regard)-- a common complaint lobbed against the game is the multitude of mini-games, and there are a lot. But honestly, alot of them are skippable (I skipped the protorelic quests, and basically all of the queens blood quests) and alot of the mini games are quite well designed (not all)--but overall, i dont think this detracts from the game. I don't love mini games in general, and i still loved and played a lot in this game because of how they were integrated into the story and sidequests; it made them much more engaging. Overall, it's an unfortunately technically flawed masterpiece of an RPG with a huge amount of carefully created content. I cant give it anything less than 10/10, and I didn't play the original in the 90s, so this is a nostalgia free score.",10,2025-01-10,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Scampi-Joe,Far too many mini-games that you have to play to get any further in the story and also to get some of the best items. The collection tasks in the open world are also more than just unnecessary. Apparently ubisoft was taken as a model here.

kwstas2,"Propably the best game I have ever played and I even played Elden Ring for hundreds of hours. This is for now in my opinion the absolute pinnacle of what a real time action JRPG can achieve. The game looks incredible even on performance mode and it beautiful design all around. The combat is incredible, the animations are world class and the attention to detail is beyond anything the series ever had before. It might not be exactly the game that every single person would give a ten but for me it certainly is. Square Enix might be my favourite developer and I can say with almost certainty that this is their finest work so far. This game is truly without a single doubt one of the greatest RPGs ever made!",10,2025-01-04,PLAYSTATION 5,user

The_Zarathustra,"This is a great game, ruined by dozens of hours of content that serve one purpose only: to make the game last longer. It's so bloated that many people (like me) won't be able to enjoy the few good parts the game has to offer. The sad thing is that the good parts are actually really good. But they're not prevalent enough to make the whole experience worthwhile. Unfortunately, I can say with confidence that I regret playing FF7 Rebirth because of these issues. So, let's start with the good: 1) The original story: this is, by far, the best part of this game. When it sticks to the original FF7, it's amazing, and can bring tears to the eyes of a long time fan like me. 2) The combat: it can be fun, but it's worse than FF7 Remake. As with everything in this game, the combat is bloated, excessively complex and the enemies are sponges that take too long to beat, all the while the windows of punishment are extremely narrow (i.e.: enemies stay staggered for a few seconds only). Now, let's talk about the worse parts of this game: 1) Side quests: I feel like SquareEnix simply does not know how to design side quests. Almost all the side content is shallow, tedious and unnecessary. It's really bad. They did try to create meaningful side quests and characters. But after playing games such as The Witcher 3 and Baldur's Gate 3, it's clear that SquareEnix needs to evolve a lot in this regard. If you hated FF16 side quests, then you'll hate FF7 Rebirth — and vice-versa. It's a SquareEnix issue, unfortunately. 2) Mini games: there are tons of mini-games. Tons. While some are fun, most are shallow, tedious and unnecessary. The problem is that some of them are mandatory — and they are the worst ones. You will remember this when a certain ""throw the box"" puzzle halts your progress. 3) Controls and navigation are clunky and unpleasant. Often times I felt like I was unable to properly control my characters, in and out of battle. 4) The open world: SquareEnix adopted the dated, obsolete Ubisoft open world model. There are towers, there are icons with side activity (that are really bad, as I mentioned before). Don't get me wrong, this model can work, and Ghost of Tsushima is proof of it. But this is nothing like it. This is a bland, empty open world with tedious side content. So, to sum it up, FF7 Rebirth is a bloated, unnecessarily long and tedious game, that will leave you angry because there is actually an amazing main story, that is thwarted by the absurd amount of shallow and utterly bad side content. If you want to enjoy the game, skip almost all side content and you'll be almost fine. But do not pay full price for this game. It's not worth it.",4,2024-12-25,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Where do I start, the open world is expansive and filled with lots of fun things to do, surprises at every corner. It's one of these games where if you do the side quests you'll be rewarded with more than just loot. I loved every bit of it, I did not expect tot like this game this much. The writing is great, the characters feel real with different motives and influences. I've read some reviews complaining about the mini-games. This game is built on mini-games, that's what makes it ever changing. There is silliness in some parts, but it's intentional and it's funny. Going through this game feels like playing multiple games all at once. If that's not appealing to you, maybe this game isn't for you. Take Queen's Blood board game as an example. You can totally ignore it, but if you don't there are plenty of surprises and twists. It's progression is a story by itself. If you can keep an open mind with all the side quests and mini-games, it'll definitely grow on you.

WeSN95,"Phenomenal story, art, score, and character writing. The introduction of long beloved characters is not dampened by expectation here. Twists and narrative decision making naturally draw the story out, allowing character relationships, story beats, andprogression to happen at a pleasant pace. At times, the linearity found in remake was more appreciable by my appetite, and some well hidden map markers, and lengthy or unfun map markers containing small to-dos would feel abundant and you might have just completed one area's map, and are greeted with another list of chores after only a brief story intermission. This is notmuchof a problem for those who skip side content or do not care to complete the map but leveling may be a consequence here asIwas always at or one above recommended level, while completing all side quests and map markers. All in all the strengths of the writing are mirrored by the strong gameplay. This iteration of action complimented by ATB, and a full cast of controllable party members and upgrade loop is my personal favorite modern FF combat system. Were it here to stay, we would have achieved the perfect blend of ability interaction and direct, sharp gameplay (perfect blocking feels awesome here). Even as an old school FF fan, who's first game was VI, I believe this is the single best system to integrate into the next numbered main series release, to blend accessibility and engagement from seasoned fans.

CloudTravels,"I really loved this game, it was a joy to play it from beginning to end, i've put almost 400hours into it, definetely my favorite game from this generation, truly a remarkable game. The creators stated that the theme of the game was bonds, given how important and well the relationships of the characters is done, i'm pretty sure they achieved their goal masterfully, the bonds between the characters are developed even within the combat when we use synergy abilites and synergy skills, they've truly done an impeccable job. I'd like to address some of the criticism regarding some people saying the game is bloated, so in defense of the game i'd say that, the problem with the game design is not the game offering too much stuff, it might be the game inviting the player to do all that stuff, but the actual content is mainly optional, and there's nothing missable in the game, so you can just focus on the main story and do the optional stuff later, besides that some of the mandatory minigames were also mandatory on the original game, so it doesn't make sense to criticize that.

Valentine_V,"Um jogo magnífico que honra o original e explora novos caminhos, enriquecendo o meu jogo favorito com uma jogabilidade moderna, gráficos deslumbrantes e uma narrativa incrível. Os gráficos do FF7 Rebirth são muito bons. O mundo de Gaia ganha vida ganhou mais detalhes que o tornaram mais vivo do que nunca - florestas luxuriantes, cidades movimentadas e paisagens impressionantes conseguem marcar ainda mais um jogo/franquia que já era inesquecível. Os ambientes são amplos, nos permitindo explorar um mundo vasto e envolvente. Os modelos e as animações das personagens são top de linha, com uma das melhores cinematografias que eu já vi em um jogo triple A. O Rebirth aperfeiçoa o sistema de combate em tempo real introduzido na primeira parte. Embora ele tenha um foco grande nos elementos de ação, inclusive introduzindo uma mecânica de parry agora, eles conseguiram balancear muito bem a ação e o combate tático com o ATB. A gente pode alternar facilmente entre os personagens, cada um com as suas habilidades únicas, o que torna as batalhas e o combate muito dinâmico e envolvente. Eles renovaram a interface do sistema de Materia, dando aos jogadores mais liberdade para experimentarem com builds diferentes. A adição de elementos de mundo aberto é um grande destaque. Com áreas maiores para explorar, o jogo oferece uma sensação de liberdade mais expansiva e mais diversidade de gameplay como um todo. Tem bastante variedade de missões secundárias, minigames e atividades opcionais no mapa, o que faz o jogo ser muito rico em conteúdo. A dinâmica das relações dos personagens é bem desenvolvida. Novos arcos de personagens e eventos acrescentam camadas ao enredo, expandindo o que existia no jogo original, especialmente com algumas mudanças notáveis na linha do tempo que se desviam do original e que na maioria das vezes funcionam em dar mais profundidade aos personagens. As atuações e as interações entre as personagens são excelentes, tanto as atuações em inglês, quanto as atuações em japonês, o elenco de voz da trilogia Remake é incrível. A música no Rebirth é uma obra-prima. As versões reformuladas de faixas icónicas, juntamente com novas composições, criam uma trilha sonora de cair o queixo. A mistura de nostalgia e inovação da trilha proporciona uma experiência inegualável.Final Fantasy VII Rebirth é um sucessor digno de Final Fantasy VII Remake, melhorando tudo o que o Remake já tinha feito e expandindo ainda mais o que a franquia oferece. A expansão do mundo, a profundidade do sistema de combate e as reviravoltas narrativas emocionais fazem deste jogo um jogo obrigatório pra qualquer jogador.

SiegeX,"I've thought about this a lot, and I've also played most of the major releases this year, and I'm sure that Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the best game to come out this year, a truly fantastic game and one of Square Enix's best. The game has fantastic graphics, although it has visual problems that need to be improved, such as pop-ins, low-resolution textures, textures that don't load and strange lightning in some places, but despite all this the game is still beautiful, the performance mode also makes the game too blurry, so they need to improve on that for part 3, the combat animations are incredible, one of the best combat animations ever with some fantastic attacks such as the synergy skills and limit breaks. The combat system is one of greatest ever, perfectly combining action and turn-based elements, so the player has to combine both when facing some of the toughest enemies in the game, there's plenty of variety on the combat too, with each character having their own unique set of skills, allowing the player to choose how they want to play based on the characters they like best and the strategies that best suit their play style. The exploration is much better than the ones in previous Square Enix titles, with vast areas with lots to do, although they could improve some of the side stuff for the next game, perhaps by adding more variety of activities that are interesting, or by better balancing the side stuff and the number of side quests, the level design is pretty great too. The side quests are also a strong point of the game, they're much better than those in Remake and reward the player with character moments and character development. The mini-games are mostly great, some of the mini-games could be full games, like Queen's Blood and Chocobo Racing, but some minigames are poorly executed and needed better controls, like the Cait Sith box minigame and Gears and Gambits, but overall most of the minigames are pretty good. The narrative and characters are simply fantastic, I really liked the direction they took with the story, and the characters are the best in the history of video games, they managed to improve on the characters from the original game, even though they were already phenomenal, which is a great achievement and they should be very proud of that, even random npc characters like Cry Baby Ned are super charismatic, it's crazy. The music is on another level, the only game where the music also tells a story, it's simply beautiful and one of the best soundtracks ever. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a true masterpiece, probably the best game of this generation so far, even if the game doesn't win any major awards at the awards events this year, I have no doubt that it's the best of 2024 when we look at all aspects of the game objectively, given its complexity, level of quality, and sheer volume of content, when some people's main complaint about your game is that it offers too much, maybe you should know that you've done an incredible job.",10,2024-12-07,PLAYSTATION 5,user

hydreichomp,"This is EASILY the greatest complete JRPG experience ever created. It literally has EVERYTHING and keeps you engaged for over 100 hours. One of the best games Square Enix has ever created and the best they have made in a very, very long time. Combat, story, graphics, world building, minigames, crafting, hard content, quests, good characters, etc etc etc. It gives you everything, and more than you expect for each of those things. It's a remake so you can't put it in the ""Top 5 JRPGs of all time"", but it definitely is the greatest modern JRPG ever created. In fact, it has me scared for part 3, because I have no idea how the heck they can top this since the bar has been set extremely high, way too high to be honest. Would realistically give it like a 9.5 for personal enjoyment, but definitely closer to a 10 than a 9. The main reason I would not consider it perfect is since it is a remake, I already knew most of the story, so it was impossible for the story itself to hit hard, except at the new parts. Moreover, I do not think this game has very high highs like FF16 and other RPGs mainly due to being a remake and me wishing the combat and certain fights were a bit more flashier (but it lacks the low lows of other games too, Rebirth is consistently good). But looking back, I just have to say again, it really is one of Square's greatest works, the best they've done in years, and the most complete JRPG experience ever created.

HoLeeFuk,"Absolutes Meisterwerk, ich liebe die Charaktere, die Geschichte und das Kampfsystem. Es gibt wirklich viele Minispiele, mit denen man sehr viel Spaß haben und viel Zeit verbringen kann. Leider fehlt der Open World Innovation und sie kann auch schnell langweilen, aber immer noch sehr viel besser, als beispielsweise Ubisofts Welten, die zwar schön aussehen, aber ziemlich langweilig sind. Insgesamt sehe ich meine Bewertung deshalb zwischen 9 und 10, aber da man keine 9,5 vergeben kann, gibt das eine 10!",10,2024-11-25,PLAYSTATION 5,user
blackhunter,"the game is truly magical, and gives us many epic, striking and very exciting moments, one of the best RPGs ever made without a doubt, with its unique battle system, varying between turn-based combat or something faster depending on the player's experience with the game makes combat really fun, fluid and very enjoyable, the game has a really stunning story and world, the game has a really extensive and interconnected map with many objectives making the player want to explore every corner of this incredible world of ff7 rebirth, there is no discussion about the songs, they are by far the best songs I have ever seen in a game, the game has more playable characters after the remake and with each of them a different combat mechanic which allows the player to choose which one he plays with. fits better and can create different fighting strategies, the way they made the game to please both long time fans and new players is surreal final fantasy vii REBIRTH delivers more than promised and the care put into the production of the game is clear, final fantasy vii REBIRTH is truly a hit in the world of video games and for me it really deserves the title of Game Of The Year 2024.",10,2024-11-25,PLAYSTATION 5,user
Mega6staR,"The remainder of the original's 1st disc has nearly been mastered in this re-imagined structure of Gaia. Loads of story, gorgeous cutscenes to add with it, and the gameplay is becoming more outgoing for exploration. I've been playing Final Fantasy since 1991-92, and I've said(since FFX) we need open round trip planet traversing to return, and they're clearly pushing for that motive. The story seems to somewhat switch up a bit from the original(which is kinda worthless), and the mini games within the main story could be somewhat dumbed down a bit for FFR3 hopefully. Also, the game is over-saturated with allot of cuteness(let me explain). Like chocobos and moogles are what we all love, but it can sometimes make you feel as if you're watching Nick Jr. Example, they have the boxing goblin from the original, acting like a character off Sonic the Hedgehog. Square-Enix, take it easy with all the cuteness lol. The combat is extremely active, far more strategic andsatisfying for a Core FF Gamer like myself. This build is what the new Final Fantasy games always needed to become. I'm hoping this game gets GoTY 2024(I doubt it'll win but), I personally give it a 9.4 out of 10. They have to remain a bit more loyal to the story, no metaverse changing plots, they need their mini games in the myst of exploration, do NOT add it to the main story to introduce us. That main game/side game in-story tutorial isn't needed at all because it interferes with the story. No more ""Lure The Chicken"" missions(even if the outcome is epic lol), lighten up on Chadley, lighten up on the HUD also. FFVII OG had no HUD unless you were in combat(making it super immersive) without so much ""MISSION STARTED/MISSION COMPLETE"" pop ups. FFVIIR3 is the one to perfect. I'm hoping our feedback hits Naoki Hamaguchi's ears on time, and hopefully he listens. Great direction for the franchise, my GoTY 2024...",9,2024-11-24,PLAYSTATION 5,user

If we remove the pointless and unfun dozens of minigames and badly designed battle system (hello magic and forced character switching for the damn ATB to load) this game is empty shell. This has the fanfic taste all over it and it is unbearable. You might even find it enjoyable up to a point when you will see how the original story, themes and characters were watered down only to fill up 3 games.",6,2024-11-20,PLAYSTATION 5,user

alexkon3,"TLDR: This game is incredible. Go buy it but remember to play the game at your own pace. You can do every side content later! Review after 113 Hours FF7 Rebirth is a return to form for Square Enix. The developers wanted this game to harken back to the earlier Final Fantasy games with a World Map, exploration with Chocobos and Vehicles and they absolutely succeeded with that. The World of FF7 is beautifully realized every Town feels unique and is beautifully crafted, it really is fun just to explore every nook and cranny and listen to NPC dialogue in the background. Multiple times during the game I thought to myself ""Okay this region is great but there is no way the next region can be as good"" but then the game surprises you and gives you another beautiful carefully crafted region. The combat is a direct upgrade of the already amazing combat system of FF7 Remake, the Characters you already know have been expanded upon and got additional new abilities and the new characters Red XIII and Cait Sith have their own unique combat styles. Red XIII is a tank based around blocking enemy hits and fuelling his Vengeance Gauge which he can unleash and get expanded attack animations and more powerful abilitie, Cait Sith can summon his Moogle as a ride that he can dismount, the Mog then acts as an NPC fighter. He can also buff the other party members and his Gambling mechanic from FF7 OG returns and is fun. There are also the varied Synergy skills which add another interesting dimension to the combat, they can help you like characters flinging Tifa into the Aird or Protecting Aerith there are also Synergy attacks where characters perform a combined attack that not only looks cool but deals quite a good amount of damage. This game brims with side content. The Sidequests in FF7 Remake were pretty bad but here in Rebirth they became actually interesting and really accomplish what sidequests should be used for, expanding on your companions, each companion gets their own set of sidequests and every single one is good, funny and varied. The Exploration on the other hand is probably the weakest aspect of the game, while the regions are beautiful the exploration in those regions are all centred around the returning character Chadley who will contact you frequently and tends to interrupt the flow of the game. Most of the exploration is a very ""Checklist"" style of exploration where you are given a list of things you can do. This can feel very overwhelming to some players who feel the need to complete everything the moment they are at that area. The game does not communicate to you that you can actually return to those places later and complete these Region based Chadley Missions any time you want later on. There are also a ton of minigames, of different quality. The best one has to be Queensblood though, this Card Game is so addicting that I wish SE would release a separate game for it... please I need it. It is probably the best FF Card Minigame since Tripple Triad. There are of course a bunch of other Minigames, Chocobo Racing, the Bike Minigame from Remake returns, there is a funny Ball game Red XIII can play that feels a bit like Rocket league, Mushroom Picking exists for one sidegame (??). Not all Minigames are good but they are optional for the most part, there are a few times where the game forces you to play one but they can either be quit immediately or they are a one for one recreation of a minigame you were required to play in the Original FF7 (Dolphin Minigame, one Chocobo race) Story I will not spoil anything here. The Story was quite a bit expanded with multiple additions from the Compilation of FF7 and new lore added. Most of it is done really well and feels like it was always part of the game. The pacing in dramatic scenes is a weakness of Rebirth, while the scenes themselves are excellent they often get interrupted which gives them no room to breathe. The game of course gives you additional mysteries like FF7 Remake did, but it will not give you the answers, the Developers actively do not want to answer them until FF7 3emake so theorycraft away as long as you want to. Overall though I can say the story is very faithful to the original game, way more then Remake was in my opinion. Sound Graphics: There isn't much more I can say about the soundtrack of this game then that it is as always incredible. FF has always been the King of Game OST and this one is no different. Again you get beautiful overworld themes that seamlessly turn into a combat Remix, you get beautiful remakes of old tracks like the beautiful Cosmo Canyon theme or fantastic new songs like the Queens Blood theme. Graphics wise the game does look good but it does suffer from common problems of UE4 games. The lighting can sometimes be very off and there is a bunch of pop in. There are sometimes some really low resolutions but that is a given with a game that big. Overall Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is one of the best games I have ever played",10,2024-11-18,PLAYSTATION 5,user

EvanC2332,"Absolutely beautiful game, I love the detail on the fiends, I love the style. I love the story changes to the original, it’s an excellent way to reintroduce the mystery from the original into a very well known story. The only time I had a real problem was in chapter 10, I got a bit bored part way through and frustrated with the length of some of the levels (it’s a bit much exposition), but the gameplay got me through it and I ended up really appreciating that part of the story by the end of the chapter. The ending fights are absolute fan service in the best. A real have your cake and eat it too scenario, and I’m personally all for that. The combat really shines in this part, it’s intuitive but still challenging and very rewarding to learn the intricacies of. The music and sound design is incredible (obviously). The mini games are in general pretty good (if difficult at times, but they’re also optional so…). Overall, you can really tell the amount of love and effort put into this game.",10,2024-11-17,PLAYSTATION 5,user

MaryRules,"A majestic experience that I will carry with me forever, it is impressive that even months after finishing the game, I still keep thinking about it and wanting to play it again, when I finished the story for the first time I could barely sleep and I spent a week thinking about what happened, without being able to start other games, this is an incredible feat that few games can achieve, so it's obvious that for me Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is a masterpiece. It's impressive how much the Square Enix development team managed to improve from the first game, especially considering that the first part of the trilogy was released in 2020, most triple A games take longer than that and often don't evolve as much as this game. The combat is better than the first game, faster and more fluid, we can use summons at any time now and we have new synergy skills between the characters, which are simply wonderful, adding beautiful attack animations, which also highlight the character relationships. The minigames work as a great way to vary the main gameplay of the game, the main minigames are excellent, like Queen's Blood, which is the highlight among all the minigames created and is an incredible addition, very fun, with a lot of depth despite seeming simple at first, it could even be its own separate game, the Piano minigame is also wonderful, despite being challenging and having a high difficulty spike when you get to Two Legs Nothin to it, and the Chocobo races are sensational, reminiscent of classic kart games like Mario Kart and Crash Team Racing, most of the other minigames are average and a few are weak like Gears and Gambits, the ones with the frogs and the one with the boxes when you play as Cait Sith. The soundtrack is spectacular as always in Final Fantasy games, with an insane amount of music, including new songs and new versions of classic ones. The story is excellent, adding more details to the story of the original game, and a few more arcs that will be explored in the final part of the trilogy, so I don't think it's possible to judge completely yet, the secondary missions have also improved a lot, with stories that develop even more characters. The characters are fantastic, some of the best characters ever made in the gaming industry! Even Cait Sith is cool now. Regarding the negative points, as no game is perfect, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth also has some defects that can be improved on for the final part, the animations of some exploration actions are a little janky, like Cloud's jumping, or when we hang on ropes as Yuffie, the camera lock-on can change targets very easily at times, it wasn't frequent on my playthrough, but it's annoying when it happens, and the game also has some technical problems like pop-ins, textures that don't load, low resolution textures and weird lighting in some places, these issues are minor, so I don't think they detract too much from the game as a whole, I also didn't have any bugs or crashes. Another point that I have seen other people criticize is about the game being bloated, which makes the game's pace slow and boring according to them, but I believe that this criticism doesn't make any sense, given that most of the things that are criticized are optional content in the game, which exists as a way to add even more value and things for you to do in the world if you wish to, but, which you are not obligated to do, of all the minigames, I think only four are mandatory throghout the whole story, being the following, the Dolphin minigame at the end of chapter 4, which is very short and an improvement on the original, the minigames in Costa Del Sol for you to get beach wear for Cloud, Tifa and Aerith, the Chocobo Race minigame to escape Corel's prison, which is also faithful to the original game and much better, and the box minigame with Cait Sith, which really is one of the low points of the main game, apart from these moments, everything else is skippable, including the Queen's Blood tournament on the Shinra Cruise, so to me this type of criticism doesn't make sense, every open world game offers you a wide range of optional content to make the world richer, so this type of criticism would be applicable to any open world game, including classics like GTA San Andreas, GTA 4, Bully, Red Dead Redemption, etc. Who doesn't remember the famous bowling with Roman in GTA4, or the terrible mission with a miniature plane in GTA San Andreas. Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is a masterpiece, it's the most complex and ambitious game I've played this year, and certainly a game that marked me forever and will survive the test of time.",10,2024-11-12,PLAYSTATION 5,user

You will face an enemy you want to eliminate then try lock on, then you will actually lock on to someone closer you at your side then the camera will pan to them boom now you are locked on to someone you didn’t want. Then you have to flick to them while getting attacked. It’s crap. Happens almost every fight. The world is also filled with Ubisoft class open world crap to do (fight this enemy this way, gather this, etc) it ****.

That said, I was completely shocked at how far the Rebirth team went over and over and over again. About 40 hours in and I realized that ""holy crap this is what I've been waiting for in a next gen FF game, it's really not a drill."" The combat is my favorite in any game thus far, hands down, no contest. They somehow figured out how to make the open world map travel feel good and like THE OG but in a modern era. The additions to the characters via the writing and animation was brilliant and made me not only love them more, but fall in love all over again. The voice acting, at least for an American audience,was top notch. Whether or not you like a character you cannot deny that each one feels real and alive. They sold us on them so we'll that after the credits rolled it felt like a group of friends I grew close with just left me for however many years until the next game. Even with the changes I somehow felt that same gut wrenching feeling in the end. This game is a literal 10/10 for me.even at its lows it's so much better than most things we get these days and I REALLY hope the rest if SE was taking notes on what this team was doing and how they did it because my god not only did they deliver a masterpiece, they did it in record time.

Les clins d'œil à l'opus original et à la saga FF sont nombreux. Le gameplay, déjà incroyable dans Remake, est absolument jouissif. Les émotions des personnages à travers les magnifiques cutscenes sont palpables. Les ajouts scénaristiques ne plairont pas à tous mais ils s'agit d'un parti pris.

CarpathianDevil,"I could write for days on FF7 Rebirth. I took 2 weeks off of work to play this, as I did for remake. I've been playing rpgs since the 80's. My first jrpg was Dragon Warrior on NES and I played Final Fantasy 1 on NES the day it was released. The FF series has had it's ups and downs throughout the decades and Rebirth is definitely a high. I loved the OG FF7 and consider myself a huge fan. I purchased the collectors edition of Rebirth and I have zero regrets. To sum up, FF7 Rebirth added so much onto what Remake started. Remake in retrospect almost feels like a blueprint or maybe more of a primer to what Rebirth would eventually become. It has so much to do in it, it's one of the few games that I feel actually deserves the $70 price tag. By the time I was done, I had dropped about 121 hours into it and I haven't even finished everything. It was a wild ride with absolutely incredible action combat, lovable characters, beautiful locales, charming and exciting music and nostalgia for days. I can't recommend this game enough. As an older gamer, I've become a bit jaded with games lately. It takes a lot to impress me. With rebirth I found myself laughing out loud, clapping and just having the time of my life playing Rebirth. I've played thousands of games throughout the decades and I can't remember a time I've had so much fun and enjoyed myself, I felt like a kid again. I wanted to explore and experience every nook and cranny of FF Rebirth and it felt great doing it. When all was said and done, I thought to myself, this game definitely makes my top 5 games of all time list and most likely will be considered as my favorite jrpg all the time. It easily makes the list with other greats like Xenogears, OG FF7, Dragon Quest 11, Persona 5, Legend of Dragoon, FF7 and Chrono Trigger. This is what a game looks like when the developer is both highly experienced and filled with passion for the game they are making. 10/10 is very rare for me to rate a game, but FF7 Rebirth deserves every last bit of it, easily.",10,2024-10-30,PLAYSTATION 5,user

The goods: - Interesting main story - Great characters and team synergy - Beautiful regions The bads: - Clunky combat: dodge doesn’t do anything, block is not immediate. Pressing the block button doesn’t stop the basic attacks. It’s too late to press block by the time you see signs of enemy about to attack, because the game would still be executing the basic attack commands. - Minigames and puzzles: hate playing Mario party while trying to save the world. - Open world exploration: marking everything on the map and telling players exactly where to go is not exploration, it’s simply checking off items on a list. And it’s the always the same objectives in every region. Chadley is annoying. - Side quests: most of them lack in depth and are a distraction to the main story. E.g. catching chicken or helping some random villager train in Gongaga. These side quests are something to be checked off (like the open world objectives) rather than something fun or meaningful. - Romance: the game picks a date for you! Good luck if you want to date Tifa but hasn’t done her side-quests filled with mini-games. - Forced party selection: especially hate playing as cait sith. Put together, you’ve got a big, beautiful but empty world filled with laundry lists of repetitive open world objectives, menial side quests, and frustrating minigames and puzzles, all of which interrupt the game pacing.",7,2024-10-29,PLAYSTATION 5,user

DrakengardLover,"This is one of the most overrated games I have ever played. Its one of the worst examples of filler and padding to increase the run time of the game. If this game did not have the Final Fantasy IP attached to it, it would just be seen as another generic open world JRPG with open world quests that are on par with Ubisoft with how copypasted and lazy it is. There is so much potential and so many great things about this game that is ultimately held back by how needlessly tedious it is, and with how bad the ending is. Making the remake of FF7 a trilogy that will more than likely span across three generations of consoles was never a good idea, but I am not surprised by how much less this game sold compared to Remake. I hope Square locks in and actually makes a cohesive game that doesn’t add in more filler to pad the run time and does FF7 justice, but my hopes are not high with them and I will not be buying the next game until it is at least half off on sale. Also the Caith Sith Shinra Manor section in Chapter 11 is one of the worst in all of gaming, and whoever was in charge of that should never be allowed to make games again without heavy supervision.",5,2024-10-29,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Stevie0022,"Definitely my GOTY… As someone who played the original Final Fantasy VII back in 1997, diving into Rebirth felt like catching up with an old friend who’s had an incredible makeover. This 2nd entry in the remake expands further on the original story and characters in a way that feels fresh but still familiar. From the get-go, I was captivated by the stunning environments and attention to detail. The combat system is a solid blend of real-time action and strategy, making battles both fun and challenging and sees a vast upgrade to Remake. I ended up sinking hundreds of hours into the game, chasing that 100% completion and finally **** the platinum trophy—it was quite the journey! The writing struck a nice balance between nostalgia and new content. The characters are well-developed, and the dialogue often had me laughing or even misty-eyed at times. Overall, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth does a fantastic job of honoring the original while bringing enough new elements to keep things exciting.

OrangeClock,"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth has mistakenly created a wrong path of RPG development by drawing players attention toward an incredible amount of mini games and other relevant elements. The worse situation is that much of these minigames are not really interesting. They are a very solid distraction and obstacle, stopping players from focusing on the story and narrative. It is undeniable that developers are making efforts to improve the quality and volume of their work. The graphics look terrific, the music and art designs are just as remarkable as any other Final Fantasy games, and designing various types of minigames will also consume time and resources. But this is not my expectation for the RPG's development. I would encourage the producers and developers of the Final Fantasy to focus more on stories, characters, and performative combats that excite us. There is very limited progress on Cloud's journey. Questions left by the story of ""Final Fantasy VII Remake"" remained unsolved. Therefore, while I am frustrated with this game, I am still looking forward to playing its sequel, which is the last episode of the Final Fantasy VII trilogy.

GideonGilead,"I first played Final Fantasy VII when I was about 8 or 9 years **** changed gaming for me in the best way possible. Alongside Metal Gear Solid, it was my favourite game of all time as a child and I have played it through at least 15 times, as recently as a few years ago. Rebirth is absolutely abysmal. Without any ounce of hyperbole, it is one of - if not THE worst game I have ever played on the PS5. Every single time you do something, you're forced to walk and listen to characters talk. Finally, some **** wait, I'm walking and listening again. Quick, that person is escaping! Aaaaand Cloud is walking again. I don't understand how this game is rated as highly as it is, I really, really don't. Did I get a different version of the game? How are people saying this is one of the greatest games of the year, let alone one of the greatest JRPGs? I have never in my life been so miserable playing a game. I genuinely cannot fathom how Final Fantasy VII has become something professionally designed to be as tedious as possible. Just stick to the original, it's infinitely better in every way. And no, this isn't me saying “games were better back then!”, because despite everything, I actually really enjoyed Final Fantasy XVI.

therealsayuri,"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is nothing short of a breathtaking triumph that captures the essence of the beloved original while boldly charting new territory. From the moment you step into its vividly crafted world, the game envelops you in a rich narrative filled with emotional depth and character development that rivals the best in modern storytelling. Visually, the game is a feast for the eyes. Every environment is beautifully rendered, from the sprawling landscapes of Gaia to the intricate details of urban settings. The animations are fluid, and the character designs breathe new life into iconic figures, making them feel fresh and relatable. Combat is where Rebirth truly shines. The hybrid system merges real-time action with strategic elements, allowing for exhilarating battles that feel dynamic and engaging. The addition of new mechanics and characters enhances gameplay, keeping encounters fresh and exciting. Boss battles are particularly memorable, each presenting unique challenges that test your skills and strategies. The soundtrack is a masterpiece in its own right, blending nostalgic motifs with new compositions that elevate emotional moments. Each track seamlessly integrates into the gameplay, enhancing the immersive experience. Narratively, Rebirth takes daring risks, expanding on themes introduced in the original while introducing new storylines that keep both newcomers and veterans on their toes. The character arcs are deeply engaging, with moments of genuine emotion that resonate long after the screen fades to black. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is not just a sequel; it’s a redefinition of what a role-playing game can be. It’s a celebration of the franchise's legacy, wrapped in innovation and creativity.

Drake_Du,"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a triumph. What Square Enix managed to achieve with Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is nothing short of impressive, a game that was developed over a period of approximately three years, that is extremely rich in high quality content is something surreal nowadays, the entire basis that was built in the first game of the trilogy is improved in the second game, which is a wonderful feat, and which I hope will serve as a foundation for the next games in the franchise. Regarding gameplay, Final Fantasy VII Remake's combat was already excellent, with a great mix of action combat and strategy elements that respected the original game, the only negative points were the aerial combat that wasn't good with characters that depend on melee attacks like Cloud and Tifa, and the use of Summons that was restricted to certain larger environments, fortunately these two points were improved in Rebirth, melee characters have new gameplay mechanics added to their kits, which make aerial combat very fun and responsive, the combat as a whole is more fluid and faster, and regarding the use of summons, the game's camera is now a little further away from the characters and the scenarios are wider, which allows summons to be used at any time in the game, in addition to that, combat has been expanded with synergy skills that add a type of attack that is spectacular to watch and which adds even more personality to the game's characters, the variety in gameplay is also huge, given that we have seven playable characters, each with a unique combat style and many possibilities of how to play given the different materia builds. The minigames work as another way to diversify the game's “standard” gameplay, most of the minigames are very good, with emphasis on Queen's Blood, which could even be a game in itself. There’s also a relationship mechanic between the characters, which affects who you will go out with in the Gold Saucer date, it is very well designed and adds weight to the choices the player makes when responding to the other characters in the group and is an expansion of what existed in the original game. We have several ways to navigate the world this time, with vehicles and Chocobos, it's just incredible, just when you think the game can't give you anything else, suddenly you get a Chocobo that practically flies in the air, that's fantastic. The game's level design is also much better than Remake’s, which was very linear and simple, now the game has more verticality and great exploration, the variety of biomes is also great, and the updated version of cities like Kalm and Cosmo Canyon are beautiful. Regarding the story, the characters are simply incredible, probably the cast of characters in FF7 is the best cast of characters in the history of video games, and in this game they do justice to the characters from the original game and make them even more interesting, the quality of the side quests has improved a lot too, with interesting stories for each of the sidequests, which reward the player by adding more depth to the characters. Regarding the soundtrack, as well as in the case of the cast of characters, FF7 has one of the best soundtracks in the history of video games, and in FF7 Rebirth they created around 400 songs, adding a lot of variation to the franchise's main songs, and creating lots of new music, which is played in different areas and at different moments of the game, it's simply a brilliant soundtrack, and one of the best ever made in the gaming world. Regarding the negative points, most of the game's negative points are about technical aspects, such as the performance mode that makes the game look blurry, textures that don't load, low resolution textures, pop-ins, strange lighting and shadows in some places, but these problems are small and are not enough to hinder or take away many points from the game as a whole, I also didn't have any bugs or crashes during this game, which is impressive for a game of this size and with such complexity. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a game that transcends the fact of being just a fun game, and becomes a fabulous work of art that I will carry with me forever, for that I will be eternally grateful to the developers at Square Enix who managed to achieve this enormous feat, honoring one of the most important games in the history of video games. Thank you very much.",10,2024-10-07,PLAYSTATION 5,user

This story is trying to be a retelling of the original game's events alongside creating new events. This is also done with the inclusion of Zack Fair, the protagonist of another one of Square's games, Crisis Core. It does come off a bit confusing at first, as Zack Fair is not suppose to present this late in the original story, but it is clear that Square is paving the way for another possibility of the original Final Fantasy 7 Story. All the while, they are focusing on the aspects that people loved from Part 1 of this remake series. Overall, FF7 Rebirth gets a 10/10 from me.

Luxar_,"Si el concepto de anime de Naruto fuese llevado a un videojuego, éste se llamaría Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. La historia se siente exageradamente estirada, las misiones son infumablemente aburridas, los nuevos personajes secundarios se sienten muy muy muy mal, y son muy olvidables. De las 75 horas que pasé jugándolo unas 35 fueron de puro tedio. En cuanto al mapa: los puntos de interés del mapa se basan en o bien mata a x grupo de monstruos, o bien pulsa triangulo en las piedras de mako, o bien pulsa un patron en los stands de invocaciones, o bien activa la torre al puro estilo far cry 3 (pero mucho peor). Lo de las protomaterias no estuvo mal, pero sin más. Mucho mapa, pero nada interesante que hacer. El combate: Si estas en modo normal con spamear L1+ Triangulo hasta dejar al enemigo vulnerable y luego L1+Cuadrado para matarlo te haces a todos y cada uno de los enemigos del juego. Los enemigos que más dificil se te harán serán porque tendran ataques que no se podrán esquivar, una cosa que me parece lamentable que pueda existir en 2024. La música: Lo siento, pero prefiero la banda sonora del FF VII original mucho antes que esta. Gráficamente el juego se ve sobresaliente bajo, es un paso atras respecto a FFXVI, pero se ve excepcionalmente bien. Soy fan de la saga desde pequeño y no me parece mal juego, me parece un juego que tiene el aprobado, pero sin más. Podrán decir lo que quieran, pero en unos 150 GB que pesa este juego, y si hubiesen recortado contenido innecesario podrían haber creado perfectamente un remake de Final Fantasy VII que cupiera en un único videojuego.",6,2024-09-30,PLAYSTATION 5,user

I'd say it's too long, there are too many quests/materias/mini-games etc. But these complaints are only valid because I don't have much free time so only my own problem :) I'm not sure but this game has about 20 hours of cut scenes - it's like 2 seasons of a TV show. There are 5 or 6 regions in the game and every single region could be a separate 60-70$ game. It's unbelievable how much work was done here.

rened22,"It improves upon every bit of groundwork the first game laid down. But the most notable standouts by far are the voice performances. The copious amounts of grunting and exhales are almost completely filtered out from the script, which makes the whole experience actually pleasurable. The gameplay too has been expanded, and now offers an enormous variety of combinations to keep the enjoyment high throughout the 70-odd hour playthrough. If I had to find something to criticize about this game, it would be the poorly implemented Performance mode, namely the level of picture clarity while using it. It is downright abhorrent, and I had to switch to Graphics mode as a result.",10,2024-09-24,PLAYSTATION 5,user
Taser9001,"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth serves as the second part of a three-part reimagining of an all-time classic RPG tale. It continues Final Fantasy VII Remake's habit of enhancing and adding new story elements to what some consider Square Enix's greatest masterpiece. Picking up from the end of Remake, as Cloud and the gang leave Midgar and explore the wider world of Gaia, Rebirth takes many iconic locations from the original PS1 game, and gives them the rebirth they deserve. With new life breathed into it, this fantasy world feels more alive than ever before, and looks stunning to boot. As is the trend throughout the Final Fantasy series in general, the music is astonishingly good, taking an already amazing OST, and creating new greatness with it. The music is dynamic, and fits the world it is attached to superbly, and works amazingly well with the game's sound design. Not only are the sound design and music a treat for your ears to behold, but so is the voice acting. With a whole array of voice actors returning to voice this iconic cast, as well as newcomers coming in to voice those who were absent from Remake, the acting is among the best of the Final Fantasy franchise. The one thing that could potentially put people off a little is the abundance of minigames, some of which are necessary to progress the story. This shouldn't be anything new or too daunting for veteran Final Fantasy fans though, as the original Final Fantasy VII was very much the same. Whilst the side content and most of the minigames are optional, they are very much worth doing, as they are fun and help bring the world to life even more so. Perhaps one of the most important things is its gameplay, and wow, the combat is easily among the best, if not the very best, of the series to date. It takes everything that Remake does right with its combat, and improves upon it. Its combat is incredibly easy to pick up, and those who put in the time to master it will enjoy the harder challenges that the game has to offer and test the player's skill with. This game is an absolute treat for Final Fantasy VII fans, and should be on every Final Fantasy fan's must play list. It is easily one of the strongest entries for quite some time.",10,2024-09-22,PLAYSTATION 5,user
lifeiswonder,"A beautiful rebirth of our memories with *Final Fantasy VII*. Although it is a remake, it successfully updates and alters the story flow in a way that feels natural rather than jarring. The game carefully remakes and utilizes the original content and culture, showing how much Square Enix has learned from their previous titles, like *Final Fantasy XV* and *Final Fantasy XVI*. Their commitment to high-quality, detailed game development is evident, and their passion clearly resonates with players. If I were to find one drawback, it would be the mini-games. While most of them are of high quality and quite enjoyable, making them optional for the main story would be a good improvement. Overall, the game boasts a well-made system, superb music, and stunning visuals. I believe it's nearly perfect!",10,2024-09-22,PLAYSTATION 5,user

gorthaurmog,"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a masterpiece that transcends expectations. The epic narrative, which continues the events of Remake, offers a new perspective on the iconic FFVII universe, expanding the story in meaningful and exciting ways. The game not only respects the source material, but also brings surprises that keep even the most dedicated fans on the edge of their seats. Every dialogue and character development is handled with care to provide a deep emotional immersion. Rebirth’s combat system is a perfect evolution of what we saw in Remake. The mix of real-time action and strategic commands works smoothly, allowing the player to have complete control over their characters while managing skills, magic and limits. The diversity of enemies and bosses makes each battle unique and challenging, without ever becoming repetitive. The world of Rebirth is vast and incredibly detailed. The sense of exploration is one of the game’s greatest strengths, with beautiful environments and secrets hidden around every corner. The freedom to explore Midgar and beyond provides a sense of constant discovery, while the visual and sound design truly immerses the player in this vibrant world. The soundtrack, composed by Nobuo Uematsu and other talented musicians, is a true gem. Reinterpretations of classic FFVII themes, mixed with new compositions, create an unforgettable listening experience. Each piece of music perfectly complements the moment in the game, whether during intense battles or in the most emotional scenes. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a game that not only lives up to the legacy of the original, but also elevates the experience to new heights. With a rich narrative, enhanced combat, a captivating open world, and stunning graphics, the game deserves every inch of its 10/10 rating. It is an essential experience for longtime fans and new players alike, further solidifying FFVII’s place as one of the greatest RPGs of all **** this game doesn’t win Game of the Year, I will never consider their opinions again.",10,2024-05-31,PLAYSTATION 5,user

I frequently forgot what the main plot is and what I should do next after I finish grinding minigames. The plot is super confusing. I didn't play the original but the last chapter is confusing as hell. WTF is happening here. Is Aerith OK? Why is Cloud appearing here and in the next second a different place? And why and what Zach is doing here suddenly? I don't even understand Zach's role and narratives in the whole game. I feel like the game is really bad at telling a good story. And I was questioning myself why I spent so much time playing this game to end up with a bad taste in my mouth. At this point, I am wondering why we need 3 games for ff7 at all. Can't we just do 1 remake and truncate all unnecessary parts and tell a good story?",7,2024-09-18,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Full of details, great characters, probably my favorite combat in the FF series, and an absurd amount of content that just keep giving and giving.

Deimoose,"I played the original FFVII for the first time last year before delving into the Remake saga, and even without the baggage of nostalgic attachment, I am perpetually baffled by all the decisions they keep making with the story of this project. This remake project has been mishandled beyond belief all the new changes and additions to the story are made either for the sake of subversion or fundamentally misunderstanding what made the original story work to begin with. In regards, to the open world, it is bland, empty, and littered with repetitive Ubisoft-like objectives. Get a tower, open area, hit points of interests where you scan stuff, kill stuff, take pictures of stuff, rinse, and repeat for every area in the game. And despite the huge hub areas being huge and populated, it feels hollow, like they plastered the same NPCs everywhere to give the sense that people actually live in these locations when in reality it feels like some sort of hollow artificial tourist attraction. The developers stated that this game is 100 hours when in reality 70 out of those 100 hours consist of mind-numbingly boring side content and mini-games that serve no narrative purpose other than to pad out the game time. It was fun for an hour or two but when you make whole MAIN STORY chapters revolve around one minigame it becomes ridiculous. It's clear the SE want to milk these games for every penny they can get, and it's comical how badly people are eating it up. The side quests suffer from the same issue in remake in that they are all clear after thoughts since 99% of them are either fetch quests or kill quests. Extremely unmemorable and forgetful. For the few moments I still managed to enjoy during my playtime of Rebirth, it's incredible how much of that goodwill was washed away as my eyes glazed over playing through Chapter 14. I already deemed this overarching meta/multiverse plot as bad fanfiction after completing Remake, and Rebirth has only further cemented my belief that this story has gone completely off the rails and now all the writers can do is pander and hype up fan service moments in hope that the blind ff7 fanatics will love it. To conclude I want to say that In the process of Square Enix trying to replace the original with this ""remake"", I believe they have immortalized it. Years from now when this saga is complete, detached from the hype cycle and speculation, this remake trilogy will be forgotten and buried in most people's consciousness. It's a modern event with no lasting significance. To me, it's a traveling circus deemed to limp over the hill never to return to town. Eventually, all the hype and the social media ruckus will follow with it. And maybe then people can go back and experience the real FFVI for themselves because it is seriously an inreaching deep and emotional journey.",2,2024-09-15,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Each side quest either expands the world you are in or gives a member of the cast some solid character development. This is one of those games that I just could not put down.

After spending many many hours trying to get thru this filler material that is most of the game... the final boss chapter that kills you without a chance is a joke and has deterred me from finishing this game and playing the third installment. well done guys. you just saved me $90. I thought this game was going to be quality and fun... it was painfully long, too much minigames and filler to call it fun. The interaction between characters was very awkward and as if it was written by a boy pretending to have female friends. Dialogue is painfully dull. I blame the translation but some things don’t translate and this game suffers for it. I tried to avoid the long drawn out battles near the end as I wanted to end this overhyped nostalgia. Your kidding yourself if you give this a 10. Yes visuals in cutscenes are 10 and look very expensive, yes, the environment is beautiful... the gameplay as repetitive and painfully drawn out combats mechanics and the characters are one dimensional. Cloud is a vanilla cookie with no personality, the girls are the only interesting characters and even then... they don't get much to work with.

The Story, the Characters, not all of them are playable, sure, but how the OG Team who delivered this, feel like they put a lot of surprises on this game as a box. The feels, the nostalgia, even the new ways to engage with a World we could just see as empty for the most part, now goes on a scale that I think no one could've predicted aside from the trailers. The GORGEOUS amount of content. My god, felt like I didn't pay enough for the game and everything it has, and what's to come. Can't wait to check how the remaining segments of the Story unfold and how we're gonna engage on the World with everything about to take place with the Weapons and the Knights of The Round Summons.

The Chocobos are incredible and can fly, glide, climb, jump and sprint in different regions, they can fight with you and can be summoned during battle when requires are met. The combat is fantastic and allows you to switch between real time and throw some commands and super attacks into it, Soundtrack and arrangement is awesome too, The game is much much much bigger than the first one (FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE) and is a solid 10/10 to me NO MORE TO SAY CAUSE SPOILERS, GO ENJOY THE GAME!",10,2024-03-30,PLAYSTATION 5,user

In terms of content, it's one of the most remarkable games I've ever played. The expansive world is complemented by exceptional gameplay and a captivating plot. While some parts could have been fine-tuned (perhaps benefiting more from subtraction than addition), the experience is elevated by an incredible soundtrack and by a remarkable technical achievement, undermined only by too little powerful hardware (PS5). It's hard to imagine what more one could ask for from a JRPG.",10,2024-09-01,PLAYSTATION 5,user
Sam_Wall_04,"The first half of my favorite game of all time, FFVII, has been remade in a stunning high fidelity remake via pt. 1&2. Both parts only cover the first 50% of the entire FFVII experience. Part 2 will be covering Kalm - The Forgotten Capital. Iconic scenes remade & reimagined are so beautiful on a 2k or 4k display. The lighting and shading looks good but there are some hiccups here and there. Some ugly textures and strange texture pop in sometimes. All are fairly forgivable. The frame pacing of the animations and cutscenes are very fluid, so even while playing with the 30fp graphics mode the experience was smooth throughout. Unfortunately the 60fps mode really scales down the image quality, but still enjoyable. All of which can be fairly forgiven. 8/10 for fidelity and performance. The gameplay consists of many different regions of the planet to explore, from grass plains & mountains, to jungles & vast canyons, & even the ocean. Each of these regions are huge and very beautiful looking areas to experience. Depending on the region the chocobos you ride will have different unique traits from one another Such as climbing, gliding around, and propelling themselves with water jets. There is plenty to do in each region of the planet and a 100% playthrough will take you a long time. Unfortunately while the exploration is in fact very fun, in terms of things to do it has a fetch quest & check list feel to them which could get redundant. Each of these regions have towns to explore and areas to pick up side quests. Players to challenge to the simple but effective queen's blood card game. The entire game is packed with many unique mini games. However some can feel frustrating with some poor controls. 8/10 for exploration gameplay. The combat is packed full. From many unique materia setups, synergy abilities, & a large variety of enemies and bosses to experience. Its an amazing 50/50 mix between rpg & action combat. Using the action combat to gain atb to use abilities and parry enemies, and combining elemental effective abilities & spells with pressure & stagger to deal a bunch of extra damage. You can use limit break which do a ton of damage, and summon materia to summon a beast that aids you in combat The fluid mix between rpg and action with a vast variety of strategies and setups to choose from, along with an immensely vast variety of enemies to choose from make combat very fun. 9/10 for combat. The continuation of this rewritten story for the FFVII Remake project has been fairly exciting, recapturing iconic moments in full hd with motion capture to captivate the impact of each scene. The new additions to this story have been overall thrilling for even a fan of the original, while staying consistent and faithful to the original plots. From start to finish each scene adds more life to these scenes and the characters to express more of the emotion. Each character shines very well with having their own fun personalities that get widely expanded upon as the story progresses. You can pursue relationships with each character to gain new synergy abilities in combat. 8/10 for narrative and characters. The OST of this game is a work of art. Over 400 new tracks for part 2 alone. Beautifully composed music that remakes the old memorable classics from the original game that captures the feel of every moment. While exploring the world you get this beautiful theme that smoothly transitions into a more hyped up version of the song while entering combat, to then going back to the slower theme of the open world. All of which makes for an incredible OST to truly captivate the player with each scene. A 10/10 for OST Composition. Truly a game worthy of praise, with some unfortunate clear downsides. Thankfully square has looked at certain issues and confirm they push to improve for the third and final entry of the FFVII Remake project. Which will be covering the last 50% of the entire FFVII experience. Overall a great game. 8.5/10 Overall.",8,2024-09-01,PLAYSTATION 5,user

It blends humour and goofiness with serious and heartfelt character interactions and epic and multifaceted storytelling that provide a gripping experience.

snapgacklepop,"I found this game pretty insufferable which is a shame. They did everything possible to put road blocks in front of you to slow down story progression. They took away the sense of urgency the original had and made the characters childish when they are meant to be 'saving the world. Instead of all the mini games they threw in to stop progression they should have just had fantastic optional side quests in the world. Serious side quests about the current crisis the game world is facing. Instead of generic fetch Quests and silly character Quests. The Witcher 3 had amazing side quests and have never understood why other games can't replicate this. This game had lots of potential but ended up a frustrating mess. The battle system is alright although it does start to feel repetitive and tedious as there are so many extra added boss battles. Collecting the summons just does ****. They could have been another side quest like in the original where you had to go through certain steps and get to certain locations to collect them. This time they are another very annoying mini game and very easy to find. This game is very pretty and when you start playing it, you get a sense of awe although that quickly starts to diminish as you work your way through the story and discover the slog you have to put yourself through. I really wanted to enjoy this game and thought it was going to be pretty epic as the remake was pretty good and had some extra added characters which were fine but unfortunately they really dropped the ball and ruined that in this game. It's a real shame. I really wish they just made an 100% exact remake down to absolutely everything from the original game. Then this could have been amazing on modern systems.",2,2024-08-28,PLAYSTATION 5,user

It tries to merge with multi-universe but they lack of ability to make this work well. 3) The so-called open world lacks of items and empty.

This game truly has my heart, I can say that this is my favourite game series of all time. I think everybody should give this a chance and see just how amazing FF7 is. Even putting the story aside, this game offers stunning visuals in an open world packed with mini games and gems and amazing combat.

jamesT38,"I honestly don't know how this game is rated so high. I mean maybe if the game was in Japanese the tutorials would be better. But having never played FF7, I played the remake and thought everything was polished nicely. This game is just down right terrible at times. The lighting in caves just goes completely black for the first 50 ft in the cave, can't even see your character. In the remake you had to do like a pull up challenge this time it's sit ups but instead of using triangle circle blah blah they use all the trigger buttons knowing the controls get slightly harder to press every time. The combat simulator there's times where it'll steal your camera just to swollow your character with unblockable instead of allowing you to dodge it. They put some of the most obnoxious monsters together. 3 that stay underground the whole fight only doing red attacks to your characters. And you have to just get lucky to hit one with another character as it pops out. Or another where the AI is so freaking stupid you put something to sleep just for the AI to continue fighting it to wake it up.

Djawa,"Just finished a 70-hour run filled with nostalgia, wonder and, as anyone who has played the 1997 original, high expectations. The easy way would have been to just put a new skin on a beloved classic. What the team at Square Enix did was much more risky and I think it paid of. Notwithstanding the highly debated ending, I cannot recommend this game enough. The game manages to build on and extent the stories of all these beloved characters in way that kept me hooked. The world is beautifully crafted, the fighting system engaging and varied . The open world does run into the well known problem of a slightly repetitive overload of side content, but that does not change the fact that there has been no game this year that got me so invested into both the world and its characters. There is nothing more beautiful than putting down your controller and finding out tis 4AM and you have been playing for 6 hours straight.

The open world could have been exploited better too but the world in itself is pretty and pleasant to look at so it's fine. 10/10 for the story and its delivery, least 1 for some little defaults about the game aside of it.

Gennerik,"I really wanted to love this game, and I looked forward to playing it, but I feel let down. The biggest strike against FF7 Rebirthfor me is the sacrifice of fun for the sake of realism. The game is gorgeous, and the world is huge, but there's not a sense of wonder or benefit for exploring. There's so little to do or find between the points of interest that are revealed by the towers, it's just boring. And riding a chocobo feels every bit as jolting and jostling as you can imagine (and while not as bad as FFX, controls terribly), with the constant stuttering as you travel over every terrain feature. So many of the open world mini games revolve around you moving so slowly and cautiously that it just isn't fun. But it is realistic.... The near- constant chattering of MAI and the frequent interruptions of Chadley keep pulling me back from any sort of immersion, and then if you turn off the voices and just read all the text, you can't speed anything up because the game won't let you skip to the next text until the current one is being spoken is complete. Everything just feels really padded and slow, and without the immersion, it drags on. Beyond the realism **** the fun from the game, there are so many other things that just don't seem to be done right. Combat is just a slog. Unless you're way over-leveled, even basic enemy combat takes way too long. I turned it to Easy difficulty just to make the fights shorter. Having to stagger enemies just to do any meaningful damage is a terrible design decision that adds little beyond time to battles. Almost every aspect of the game feels like it's been done better (and in many cases, frequently) by other games. Combat is a weird turn-base/action hybrid that doesn't flow well. Open world exploration is so much better in so many games (Zelda, Genshin Impact, Stellar Blade, Elden Ring, to name a few). Everything feels like there's a mini-game attached to it, and it's almost more like a tech demo than a logical sequence of games. Also, not having a mini-map for an exploration game is dumb (if I can just open up the map, why make it difficult and include extra steps?) Also, the inclusion of so many more materia to facilitate the action aspect of the game without any increase in materia slots seems a bad design. I feel that really the two things going for the game are the graphics (incredible!) and the updated story (I don't mind the changes, though I wish Sephiroth wasn't as omnipresent as he is). I'm not done with the game, but I feel like I'm having to force myself to play it way to much of the time to recommend it.",4,2024-08-06,PLAYSTATION 5,user

I lost track of what was going on a few times because we'd be going off on some boring side tangent // The graphics can look really bad at times, like some of the textures shocked me with how low quality they looked. This may be because I'm playing in high FPS mode though ---------- The bad: // Considering that this is one of the most expensive games I've ever bought, the following things really sting: // I really wanted to give this game the benefit of the doubt, but two things happened in relatively quick succession at which point I couldn't stop myself from writing this review: // The first was a moment in which I had to really slowly move some crates in order to uncover a code for a door. They weren't even spread out or anything, they were right next to each other, and it still took what felt like a few incredibly pointless minutes. // The second was a ""mini game"" in which I literally had to just walk behind some guys moving at a crawl. There was an option to shove one to make him move faster, but in reality this did nothing because you'd have to wait for the group to catch up anyway. // These are just two examples out of so many in the game which just straight up don't respect your time at all. And it just makes me wonder why the hell they put this stuff in the game, just to make it longer!? Even without it, it would be a really long game. // And that's one of the biggest problems with this game, it doesn't respect your time, it just fills it with boring useless stuff to do. // Another example is the open world segments. Sadly, they decided to follow the ubisoft formula for this game. i.e. Go to a tower to uncover some things on the map, then do those things on the map, rinse and repeat. Which wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if the things to do on the map were interesting or rewarding. But let's look at a couple of things you'll be doing over, and over, and over: // Pressing triangle 3 times to ""analyse"" something. And I'm not saying that each time the pattern will be different, no not at all, it will be the exact same pattern every time. Why are they wasting my time, why can't I just press a button once? In fact why even have this feature in the game at all? It's not fun // Climbing towers to uncover part of the map. By the way climbing in this game is painful and you guessed it... boring. Holdthe analogue stick in the direction of the next handhold and (if you're lucky) cloud will jump to it. Every now and then a tower will have a ""puzzle"" where the handholds are in a slightly different location. This would all be fine if they just made climbing a bit more engaging, but no it's just another boring thing that doesn't need to be in the game. // Another big downside about this game is that most things you do feel completely inconsequential. // Sometimes you'll find a materia lying around and get excited that it's something new to try, and most of the time it's something you already have or just don't care about. // There's a crafting system which you can basically just ignore without any consequence. // You can go looking off the beaten path for treasure chests, only to find they contain a laughable amount of money (you probably won't use) or an item (you probably won't use). // The leveling up system does nothing to make me feel excited. You unlock points at a painfully slow rate and then spend them on little stat increases that you don't really notice, or new teamwork abilities which you'll probably barely use unless you're very deliberately trying to. It's not until the last few nodes where it begins to feel vaguely worth your time. // You have relationships with each character although I'm yet to see any consequence to any of that.",5,2024-08-05,PLAYSTATION 5,user
JuniorEdilson,"Man, what can I say about this game... Sensational! I would have loved to experience this on the PlayStation 1 with the original game. Maybe I wouldn't have appreciated it as much back then, but I know this is one of the best games ever made. Even though the story is confusing and I need others to explain certain aspects of the game to me, it remains incredible.I can't wait for the final part of the trilogy and other remakes of classic games, like they say Final Fantasy IX and Final Fantasy X will be.

strif3,"What an incredible game ! Final Fantasy 7 rebirth will provide you so much content that you will be overwhelmed with ! I have played an 100 hours without seeing it. The gameplay is dynamic and still in the shape of an old final fantasy game with the old ATB system. You can find a really deep experience with it and understanding the different mechanics inside is really playful. The story pays a true homage to original game and allows a new reading behind it. Even if sometimes it can be a little bit confusing... But what a pleasure to be able to rediscovered the places of the PS1 version in an actual 3D render world !! So incredible, the game do an incredible work at recreating this aura so unique to the old game with plenty of mini games (it can be a little painful for some people) and a lot second story's with cinematic inside ! The side quest are so much better than in Final Fantasy 7 Remake it is really enjoyable to do and motivating cause the rewards have a real impact on your progression through the game. This apply also to the objectives in the open world who at first seems to me like an easiness like many open worlds do nowadays but after a few hours I discovered myself being really invest in it mainly because of rewards it provides you who has a real impact on your scaling an overall progression into the game. Also the objectives are really built with an intelligent vision who invite's you to discovered all the little secrets inside every zone. Somehow there are some downfalls to this game also. The textures on a lot of environments are not that good for a game that release in 2024. The mini games inside it are sometimes a little bit frustrating when you start invest yourself in it (this those not apply to all of them queen's blood , chocobo racing and fort condor game are really great) and the open worlds parts are sometimes fill with invisible wall that restrict you from taking action when you need it. Same apply to the chocobo you use in Gongaga region who's really frustrating using if you miss the right path to go to your destination. This kinda ruin the open world experience who's really a big part of the original game and the real promise of this one. Expect that the game is really good without bugs and the loading times are inexistant. The game conclude with a powerful ending who I'm pretty sure satisfied all the fan's of the series with cinematic looking like an hoolywood production.

AdoMobA,"Pros - the gameplay feels even better than the Remake - way larger build variety thanks to the 8-slot armors - old playable characters have new mechanics while the new add even more gameplay variety - voice acting is perfect, especially Tifa and Barret - music is always scene appropriate with some incredible callbacks - the world is massive and the way it is interconnected gives me so much hope for Part 3 - the content to price ratio is crazy for this game // Cons - not a fan of having to increase my limit break level in each and every combat to get access to the actually good ones - the lack of materia loadouts makes chapters where you change between two parties annoying (Chapter 13 on Hard had me spending more time in the equipment menu than actually playing the game) - the most memorable side-quest in the game is the chicken quest in Gongaga, not because it's good but because it is annoying - the navigation in Gongaga **** // Where Remake surprised, Rebirth delivers twice as hard. I was expecting a solid game and I got way more than I bargained for. Everything, from the combat to the exploration is better here than it was in Remake which makes me beyond excited for Part 3. Combat is better than ever. Taking a lesson from Intergrade, Cloud, Tifa and Yuffie give your party crazy amounts of air combos allowing the flying enemies not to ****. Then you add the synergy abilities. Then you add new defensive options like counterfire. And you crown it with a perfect parry system that can keep you completely unharmed if you are good. Genuinely crazy how much this game improves on Remake. The world is way bigger with side activities that unlock more materia and armor options for your characters. When the world completely opens in the later chapters I was floored by just how well connected everything was. And while there are some misses, like Gongaga thanks to its vertical navigation, the world is fun to explore and the enemies are fun to engage. A highlight of the game would be Golden Saucer and the myriad activities that unlocks. From combat challenges, cards and arcade games, Golden Saucer is a game within a game. Truly fantastic. One of my complaints would be the lack **** loadout system. The constant need to fiddle with my materia setups is not a bad thing in itself. However, the need to completely redo a character setup because the game gives you only TWO First Strike materia and TWO ATB Boosts is crazy. Some of the later chapters had me sitting in the menus for tens of minutes at a time because the story would split my party and force me to play as different setups every thirty minutes. Overall I was surprised by just how much I got out of Rebirth. While it is not a perfect experience, it does so much right that I can overlook the minor blemishes. Can't wait for the next game.",9,2024-07-19,PLAYSTATION 5,user

The music is amazing, so many tracks just hit you in the feels. The mini games are many but at least they are varied and interesting on their own. My advice to new players is just focus on the story first and don't burn yourself on the side stuff, you can always comeback to do them later whenever you feel like.

Unbreakable971,"Square Enix did something we all thought it was impossible to do : creating a JRPG in 2024 with the same ambition and the same gigantic scope that the ones we used to have during the 90's. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a monumental game that flirts with the unreasonable. He doesn’t do everything right. He is sometimes clumsy, but everything he tries aims to nourish the voluntary ambivalence of his adventure. So we laugh, we cry, we breathe, we have fun. We take turns saving the world and participating in different trivial activities. The game carries us from one state to another, always keen to entertain us in order to forget for a while the harshness of its story, and to better devastate us when it decides to remind us of the sad reality of the world of Gaia .",10,2024-07-13,PLAYSTATION 5,user

OrbMonky,"I strived really hard to find something of value in Rebirth. I enjoyed the OG, I enjoyed Remake. This feels like a deliberate mockery of both of those games and the player with several fourth wall breaking ""Yeah, we're insulting you, player. You'll keep playing anyways."" moments that felt like a surreal Andy Kaufman ""Is the audience self aware enough to clock what just happened?"" comedy bit where you're the butt of the joke. I award one point because the main cast voice actors, minus Nanaki (the voice actor was fine doing Red XIII but completely whiffed on the transition to Nanaki, which was so stunningly bad I had to headcanon it as Red XIII retiring and a literal 8 year old that looks like an animal joined the party), otherwise nailed it. That was the one good thing I could find. The OST, the bizarre disjointed yet also copy paste open world, the unnecessary forced in half baked systems (not exclusive to but definitely including the horde of borderline torturous minigames), the anime filler arc storyline, the reocurring overused insufferable characters that in some cases are killed over and over and keep coming back... all encrusting a half baked attempt at what could have been a decent plot. It's a turd caked in turds swirling amongst other turds with 9/10 main cast voice acting. The people responsible for it should be fired and blacklisted. They either do not care to produce quality, or cannot tell the difference, and either is not sustainable by me as a fan of the franchise, nor Square as a company that ostensibly wants to keep selling games to me. If I could refund it, I would, and I won't be buying anything else from them unless this trash heap is burned down and reworked for free and they also nail the final one at least to the quality that Remake had. If I had to put a tag line I would say it feels like the makers of modern Yakuza games showed up at the wrong studio and were let in and rewrote and trashed the game for a laugh and people were too dense to catch it.",1,2024-07-12,PLAYSTATION 5,user

DB9292,"FF7 Rebirth is phenomenal. The first installment was great but devs really went above and beyond with Rebirth. The already excellent real time combat has been tightened and polished beyond its predecessor and the emphasis on customization and combo skills between different party members further reinforces its overarching theme of building character relationships. Exploration is certainly not mind blowingly innovative but its reasonably fun and manages to prevent backtracking and side content from feeling painful or stale, the only exception being the annoying dialogue pop ins from chadley, if they cut those back or allow more skipping all would be golden. The relationship building mechanic is pretty straightforward but offers depth to characters back stories thar is genuinely rewarding to discover, and balancing things out to get the ""dates"" that you desire is pretty straightforward if you desire to manipulate it. Other than the combat the character interation and acting is where the game really shines. Seeing Tifa and Aerith subtly struggle for Clouds affections in cinematic high def is truly a joy for players old and new, and diving into each characters individual backstories while they interact and get to know eachother is equally fun. As a huge fan of the original plot I admit that going into the game i was worried about how much ""kingdom hearts"" and history revising would injected into things but the writers managed to keep these elements minimal, and frankly, very engaging, I was actually surprised that all changes managed to stay minimal and suprisigly enriching to the original plot, and i genuinely mean that from the bottom of my heart, the more the intentions of the rewrites became clear the more riveted I became, very rare for me, as with most remakes i hate this sort of thing, but they did a genuinely good job and respected all major plot points and very clearly respected the source material, very well done! Lastly I was pleased that the devs managed to pack this section of the FF7 story full of all of the mini games and side content that it was known for plus many more, while balancing all of the fun and drama of the overarching plot again, going above and beyond. All in all, one of the best gaming experiences Ive ever had in spite of minimal repetitiveness and an annoying ""navi like"" side character, Id give it a 9 but im going for 10 to balance out some obvious salty review bomb of 0 (ridiculous people).

There's so many different strategies to try with different characters and I love how every character gets their shine now. In Remake I mostly only wanted to use Cloud or Tifa with Barret and Aerith solely for backup/healing but now Aerith and Barret are my faves to use along with Yuffie. Then I went and played hard mode and this just made me love the game even more. The battles were so exciting, the MP management really had me thinking hard and then in the later chapters especially when you're down to your last 3000hp and 14mp and finally beat one boss then a next one appears and you just have to beat them, seeing your whole team use their limit team to get it done...just wow.

vryzze,"Disclaimer He jugado a distintos FF, empezando por el X, que sería mi juego fetiche. Sin embargo, no jugué al FF VII en su momento, por lo que el factor nostalgia no suma para mi en esta entrega. Exploración A pesar de que los mapas son muy extensos, no se incita ni se recompensa la exploración. Los escenarios son muy planos y apenas cuentan con zonas diferenciadas e interesantes. No hay recompensa alguna por explorar: lo único que consigues son cofres amarillos con objetos básicos y comunes que se pueden fabricar o comprar con facilidad. El hecho de que las armas se encuentren directamente según avanzas en la historia suma en la misma dirección, ya que no motiva ni recompensa la exploración. Por último, los eventos que podemos encontrar en cada zona son siempre los mismos: subir a una torre (siempre idéntica) para revelar el mapa, escanear un lago para obtener recursos… terriblemente plano. Esto hace que, a pesar de las diferencias estéticas, el juego se reduzca a repetir lo mismo en cada mapa una y otra vez… En el primer mapa resulta interesante, pero al poco tiempo se vuelve muy aburrido. Ritmo El ritmo del juego se siente innecesariamente lento. Las animaciones se ejecutan muy despacio, interrumpiendo constantemente el fluir del juego. Cada vez que interaccionas con algún elemento el juego se bloquea para ejecutar una animación básica que además, una vez que se completa, **** en torno a un segundo más en devolver el control del juego. Esto sucede cada vez que aparece un título, que exploras alguna zona, que consigues puntos, … es decir, con mucha (demasiada) frecuencia. Ya no digamos cuando se corta completamente la acción para que el niño pesado te cuente que acabas de analizar un lago (como si no lo supieras ya). Minijuegos Entiendo que es una parte del lore y que se hereda del FF original pero… este juego es una pesadilla de los minijuegos. Uno hace gracia, dos están bien, diez se hacen pesados, pero… resulta que la mitad del juego se basa en realizar minijuegos absurdos, cada uno de los cuales tiene su dinámica, sus controles… y su nulo interés. En muchas ocasiones parece que estás jugando a uno de estos recopilatorios de la MegaDrive… Para mi, esta es la peor parte del juego, ya que detesto que me hagan perder el tiempo, y estos minijuegos no aportan absolutamente nada. Combate El combate es interesante, dinámico y bastante divertido, además de visualmente impactante. Quizás un poco complejo al principio, ya que cuenta con muchas opciones como las acciones combinadas, pero resulta interesante. Mi punto negativo aquí sería la poca solidez del parry y de las esquivas, que en ocasiones son un poco frustrantes, aunque no suele tener demasiado interés. El hecho de poder jugar con 3 personajes al mismo tiempo y poder variarlos en casi cualquier momento está muy bien. También considero positivo que en ocasiones te fuerce a usar ciertos grupos, evitando que te acomodes en exceso. En este sentido, estaría bien una forma de guardar configuraciones de materias, ya que a veces te ves obligado a modificarlas por uno de estos cambios forzados de grupo y pierdes mucho tiempo para recuperar tu configuración principal después. Historia La historia está muy bien, interesante y bastante bien ligada. Las cinemáticas también son atractivas. Ligado con los minijuegos, me sobran las zonas en las que lo único que debes hacer son minijuegos… ya que creo que no aportan absolutamente nada a la trama. Resumen El juego es interesante: buena historia, nostalgia, buen combate, gráficos atractivos… pero pierde bastante debido a las animaciones y los minijuegos, que rompen el ritmo sin aportar nada a cambio. La exploración también podría mejorarse con recompensas más relevantes.",7,2024-07-08,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Multiversal1994,"One of the best games I've played in recent years. Incredible story telling that expands upon the original story and adds alot more depth to the characters, locations, world. -Main story quest is fantastic and has breathed new life into the story. -Side quests are all Incredible, a huge range of things to do, great stories attached to the side quests and a plethora of different styles of gameplay attached to them. -Mini-games, there is lots and lots of mini-games just like in the original title but with lots more new ones added, all incredibly well polished and lots of fun, there are a couple frustrating ones(3D brawler I'm looking at you) but all in all they are tons of fun, and all completely optional, if you don't want to play the minigames you don't have to, you can just focus on the main story. -Combat is where this game truly shines especially in Dynamic/Hard mode, the battle system has so much depth and with the new characters added provided alot more options for gameplay, there is alot of new and reoccurring materia to help build your characters the way you want them and with 7 different characters to put into your 3 man party there is plenty of different combinations to use to keep the fight interesting. -Music, the music in this game is incredible, building off the incredible groundwork laid by the amazing Nobuo Uematsu the music has evolved to even greater heights and alot of the new tracks are absolutely stunning. -Graphics, Graphically the game isn't as good as Remake due to the size of the world and the use of world lighting instead of individually placed lights, and at times the lighting will slightly look goofy on the characters (mainly during elevators/scene transitions) but dont let this detract you from the game, it still looks incredible. -time of completion, to complete my first playthrough, doing all side quests, mainstory, minigames, it took 130hours. And thats before hard mode. Overall an incredible game that is absolutely worth the price be it full price or on sale. A good metric I like to use is $1per hour of enjoyment, and this far blows that metric out of the water.

onewingedangel3,"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth improves on the first instalment in the remake trilogy in many ways, story, linearity, gameplay, music, exploration etc. The explorable locations in the map in Rebirth are massive. The moment I opened the doors from Kalm, I was greeted with the beautiful vista of the Grasslands and was given a feeling that I have not felt since leaving Midgar in the original, but unlike the original game which had an overworld map that was empty and small, the Grasslands is expansive and filled with so much to do. And from there, every region is huge and satisfying to explore. The story for the most part follows the original in its main story beats but differs slightly in certain places and differs greatly a the start and right at the end. The music is incredible and packed with 400 songs! Suzuki and Hamauzu cooked the OST for this game. Overall, while not perfect and has some flaws here and theres such as some graphical dips in performance mode and not landing certain iconic moments as well as the they were done in the original game, this game is still an incredible roller coaster of a ride and just like how I felt like when I played the original, it is an unforgettable experience.",10,2024-07-06,PLAYSTATION 5,user

A lot of these complaints generally pick up on the trend that some may remember from the first game of this 'Remake' series, and I believe in the end it will pay off, and while the endings are very much confusing, I believe that makes it a whole lot more interesting, especially since it really leaves the player to question whether or not some things will happen or not. Interestingly, for the most part, Rebirth follows the original's story quite well, with a few glaring exceptions (i.e. how Cid is met).

Kento500,"Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth es el juego que más me ha impactado en mi vida. Un historia realmente increible, seria, cómica, etc... una jugabilidad realmente entretenida y divertida. Muchisimos minijuegos divertidos, muchas horas de juego para perderte en su mundo. Un mundo muy vivo que te envuelve con cada personaje, como si estuvieses adentro. El sistema de afinidad es una locura, también ayuda muchisimo en lo que he escrito anteriormente. El diseño de niveles un lujo. Como JRPG tiene varias armas, las materias aportan muchisimo para luchar con todos los tipos de enemigos, aprovechando sus debilidades elementales, etc... la paleta de habilidades que necesitas mejorarlo en el trayecto del juego para descubrir nuevas habilidades y mejoras, cada vez más grandioso, para un JRPG es perfecto. Y como juego hibrido de RPG por turnos y acción en tiempo real, perfeccionaron lo anterior visto del primer remake, gracias a las habilidades energicas/sincronizadas. Las bandas sonoras son un lujo, obra maestras, disfruté al máximo cada banda sonora con la intensidad del volúmen en alto, un deleite. La historia se mantiene bien y esta constantemente equilibrada de acción, comedia, suspenso, etc... es entretenida y divertida en todo el trayecto del juego. Acá las misiones secundarias son muy buenas, no son muchas, algunas aportan mucho a la historia, a su mundo. Hubo una gran evolución a comparación del remake parte 1, mejoraron bastante. El FF7 Rebirth parece una segunda entrega en toda regla. y como remake, para mi, es perfecto. Con este juego van a disfrutar los fans de la saga y los nuevos jugadores, te hará llorar de lo grandioso que es. porque si, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth es la definición de grandioso en toda regla, lo perfecto que es en casi todos sus apartados. En el apartado visual, apartado sonoro(banda sonora,etc...), gameplay, lore, desarrollo,etc... Por último, El FINAL del juego, uff, sencillamente es cine, es arte puro, una obra maestra. Sin más que decir de este juego infravalorado que se merece que más gente lo juegue, espero con muchisimas ganas la tercera parte. Es el juego que más espero en mi vida. Gracias por leer hasta acá y suerte con lo que hagas. Fácilmente es el GOTY del 2024, no hay rival para tremenda obra maestra.",10,2024-06-04,PLAYSTATION 5,user
FrancisWoodly,"Overall I really liked FF7 Rebirth BUT there were 2 things I really disliked here! 1st is the huge ammount of mini games in the first part of the game! One or two mini games as part of an quest would be ok for me but there are hours of forced mini game parts threw the first part of the game which is just too much for my taste! Just saying Costa Del Sol! The 2nd thing was the technical performance even after the first couple of patches! Blurry and unsharp textures, low FPS, no matter if you´re in the quality or performance mode. I just hated it to play such an masterpiece in 2024 on PS5 with bad technical performance.Otherwise the game would have been an 9-9,5 for me…",8,2024-07-03,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Many major story points not hit the same AT ALL as the OG, and not just because I already know what happens, but because of strange changes they made.

Lionheartjsg,"As of yesterday i finally got platinum for this game after 195 hrs. I now feel comfortable leaving my full review. FF7 Rebirth is truly an amazing game start to finish. Plenty of side content including oddjobs, collectibles, legendary enemies, mini games, battle arenas you name it. In the end all of these things reward you for completion with side story, powerful items, materia or equipment. The most important thing is…ITS ALL OPTIONAL. The soundtrack is second to none, they spared no expense and it shows the variety and orchestral arrangements absolutely blew me away. I never had a game’s musicgive me a physical reaction before. Hearing the cosmo canyon theme for the first time brought tears to my **** and don’t even get me started on queens blood or the gold saucer. Absolute PERFECTION. Hard mode playthrough was intense as advertised but it forces you to learn your characters strengths and weaknesses. The VR challenges really bring this out but,defeating a boss on hard just feels so rewarding. Overall I gave this game a 10 because i never invested this much time into a single player game before.

The excessive amount of new, nonsensical minigames (most of which I don't care for or find frustrating) that's often mandated in the story progression pads the experience and open world bloat instead of fetch quests or poor pacing this time.

DrSiko,"I gave the first game a 7 despite being long awaited and was magnificent to see our beloved game and characters in 3D with high quality graphics. This one? I am generous to give it 5. The positives are the open world map which shows the power of Unreal Engine and what could be done with it, the side quests are somewhat more polished and has some character compared to the dreadful ones in the first game, but not that good either, and the combat is somewhat fun. Yuffie was a cool and fun character to both play and watch, and the backstory of the characters is more fleshed with flashbacks about their past. However, the game didn't make me very attached to either the story or the same passion to play. This can be expected as this game comes in the middle where you are already being introduced to the main characters and the whole story and nothing to really add but a series of fights which is none is memorable. The game felt like an anime. They dropped the ball on the ""dark"" aspects with a world map which is too bright and characters who are too cheerful, compared to the original game. While the ""Remake"" game was cheesy, but it was entertaining at times. ""Rebirth"" was just cringe. Hojo's constant dumb maniac laughs, Rufus's edgy character and the very cringy encounter with the party at an arena (really?) and Shinra's leaders' eccentric behavior was too much embarrassing at times. If it wasn't for the fanbase of FF7 and Tifa's precious assets, this game would be treated like the rest of lastest FF games, totally forgettable. Oh and the whispers, asinine.",5,2024-06-18,PLAYSTATION 5,user
dioholydiver,"The story and combat mechanics are great but the minigames and the boring open world activities just ruin the whole experience. Why am I going to these lifesprings and protorelics again? Couldn't even complete the protorelic quest at the end. Also, moving with the chocobo mounts is HORRIBLE and clunky.

One of those few games I classified as an impossible game, meaning that I don't understand how it is impossible to make this game, you basically need a billion dollar budget and 10 years of development to pull this off. Other recent game that made me think like this is Elden Ring. And just like Elden Ring when I reached the Altus Plateau, and with Rebirth the **** area, I thought this must be the end area, but it turned I was only half way through the game. Anyways, this game has the best combat system, the most beautiful towns, the best cast of characters ever, seriously all of them are so likable, and definitely the best soundtrack ever.

Karolina001,"I love this game and absolutely recommend it to everyone that is new to final fantasy and to all veterans who are open to some changes and don't expect an exact copy of the original game. I hope the next game will be an open world game too but with some improvements. - The word is beautiful and have a lot of visualty variety in the regions, tons of activities but just not enough enemy variety. More hidden treasures and stuff/chests/loot lying around would be cool to give us a reason to explore every corner on our own - I'm a big fan of crafting and looting and grinding so I'm happy there isaat least a small crafting system. - you can even buy Armor for your chocobo, this is a small but very cool addition - Combat system has it positives as negatives but all in all it's good, similar to remake with some upgrades like new skills you can perform together with your party members - I wish there would be a custom difficulty mode. More options, or at least there should be a possibility to turn the enemy scaling on on easy mode and on normal mode. - A lot of activities and side quest and believe me the quests are so much better than in remake, I hated them in the last game. - Combat challenges and combat Symulator, I'm a fan so there could be more of them. - I normally don't like mini games like fort condor and similar but the new card game is pretty cool. - I miss some dungeons to explore with some minibosses and special loot and rewards. - Story is good with some very cool sequences but sometimes story is a little confusing and it feels like the developers would assume everyone have played the original game - Not a fan of the new Weapon modifications system, bcs you are forced into specific upgrades and you can't choose which you would like to have. - It feels like everything is very slow, the limit bar fills so slowly, the atb from characters you don't control seems don't to fill at all, besides of that sometimes the characters you don't control don't fight at all, they are just standing there. If you don't control cloud, sometimes he is just blocking,he's ddoing nothing else thewhole time. so the AI could be much better. - Forced party members squad. The most of the time in theopen world you can choose your party but there are a lot of story parts where you're forced to specific party. It can be very annoying, bcs then you have to switch between materias aso. For example Tifa is my healer, If the game force me to switch Tifa to barret I have no healer anymore so I have to switch the materia between them or if they take Aerith away I have no magic fighter anymore so switch Materia would be necessary. So it doesn't solve the problem to just give everyone good materia bcs it depends who will be taken away and who will be on my party - Forced gameplay parts where you have to play a different character (don't want to spoil to much) All in all it's not a perfect game but it's really really good. If you like open world games with a lot of minigames and side quests and other activities. You can have a lot of fun with it. How long depends on your playstyle. I'm doing everything and grind a little bit for materials and exp so I'm already over 200hours at my first playtrough and I'm not even done and I'm NOT a trophy hunter.",9,2024-06-08,PLAYSTATION 5,user

NN010,"My time with Final Fantasy VII Rebirth was one filled with peaks and valleys. At its best, Rebirth rivals FFXIV & FFXVI for some of the best moments of any FF I’ve played so far, with difficulty that makes use of its stellar combat system & incredible music. At its worst, Rebirth was just an utter slog infested with mini-games that are mostly tedious to play through, even when focusing on the main story. The open world was… fine, but didn’t do much that hasn’t been done in games like FFXV, Horizon: Zero Dawn & the Ubisoft Open World games aside from littering the world & main story with a **** of mini-games… more of which were misses than hits. I enjoyed Rebirth on the whole, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t less excited for Part 3 now than I was for Rebirth after finishing Remake. Or that I didn’t prefer FFXVI or even Lightning Returns to an extent over Rebirth. Ratings: Creative score (story, gameplay, voice acting, art direction): 7.5/10 Technical score (graphics, audio, performance)): 8.5/10 Business Practices score: 8.5/10 (a time exclusivity deal for PS5 detracts from some great consumer-friendly decisions like shipping Rebirth on two discs to ensure it’s playable entirely without an internet connection, something that feels increasingly rare in this era of Day 1 patches & games like COD & Starfield shipping either incomplete on disc or with a disc that’s basically a license to download the game) Overall score (my thoughts on a game’s overall quality, does not consider the business practices unless they are detrimental to the experience): 8/10",8,2024-06-02,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Rednight_45,"This game has a right to be called one of the greatest games ever made. To start of with the combat system, which is extremely deep and layered especially the further you get into the game and understand the synergy abilities which is where the core of the combat lies. Secondly, the story enhances the already great story of FF7 and even though the ending might be controversial I think it will age very well when part 3 comes out with what they’re setting up. FF7 Remake already had one of the greatest soundtracks ever and Rebirth just builds upon that even more. When you do everything in the game like I did and see how literally every little thing has its own theme, you will wonder if the music budget was just unlimited. Finally, I’ll end with what to me is the heart of the game and it’s the side content. You will constantly want to keep exploring as every new region is completely different from one another and gives you new ways to traverse the massive open world. They answered a big criticism of Remake which was side missions and a lot of them in Rebirth are great. The mini games(expect for maybe 2 or 3) are very fun and replayable.

wnedgar,"A frase que define esse jogo para mim é: o melhor jogo que eu nunca vou recomendar para ninguém. O jogo é ótimo, porém para jogá-lo você precisa ter jogado o original de 1997, o Crisis Core de PSP e o Remake. Ah, e eu odeio o sistema de combate. Mas analisando o Rebirth como um jogo por si só, ele é ótimo. Exploração muito legal, os personagens são extremamente cativantes e muito bem explorados (pudera, né? serão 3 jogos, então estão cobrindo cada canto de tudo que existe). As vilas e lugares são extremamente lindos e bem feitos, cheguei a me emocionar de ver um jogo de JRPG com tanto detalhe assim - sem contar as cutscenes que sempre deram show em Final Fantasy. Dá para sentir o carinho especial dos criadores, tal qual nos FF mais clássicos da era PS1/PS2, é lindo. Mas o jogo tem problemas para mim, o primeiro deles é o combate que eu simplesmente não gosto. Pode ser o melhor para a maioria, mas para mim é um dos piores da série (só perde para o VIII dos que joguei), eu simplesmente não gosto e não me adapto. E o final [aqui contém spoilers], que simplesmente cria uma série de linhas do tempo alternativas e que só servem para complicar quem nunca jogou o original e tentar manter o interesse de fãs de longa data sem motivo algum, é simplesmente ridículo. O final do Remake eu terminei sem entender nada e tive que recorrer ao Youtube para entender os murmúrios e outras viajadas, mas o Rebirth superou isso e expandiu a loucura do Nomura e Kitase para um nível que realmente me deixou irritado por ter finalizado o jogo de um jeito tão frustrante. A clássica cena da Aerith é engolida e não passa nenhum clímax aqui, é uma atrocidade. E a batalha final? É longa só por ser, sem motivo e rasa de tudo, um desastre se comparado com as batalhas tão maravilhosas do XVI. Acabei o jogo com um gosto amargo e desanimado que na parte 3 vai ficar essa loucura de linha do tempo… que tristeza. Mas o jogo é bom. Recomendo? Não, pois quem não jogou o OG vai ficar perdido no rolê.",8,2024-05-24,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Although Rebirth has plenty of flaws, such as blurry models, pop-in, and too many mini games, to name a few, these flaws pale in comparison to the extreme highs this game made me feel. Rebirth manages to bring a fresh feel to a timeless classic by bringing beloved characters to life as well as elevating not so beloved characters (Cait Sith). Character interactions, relationships, and banter gave me a genuine, heartfelt experience of taking on the world with my friends. Rebirth does a fantastic job evolving the previous combat system from Final Fantasy 7 Remake by adding things such as synergy skills and abilities.Combat is fast, challenging, satisfying, and rewards skilled players. While I'm not a fan of open world games, I think the developers did a great job of giving me reasons why to explore the vast world of Gaia.Most of the side quest provide insightful lore and backstory that was missing from the original game. Some of the optional objectives did grow tiring, specifically the lifestream springs, I would like to do something other than pressing x 3 times at the correct time but that's a small gripe. The story can be confusing at times but stays mostly faithful to the original while expanding the lore and amplifying the originals emotional scenes.

But the most impressive part of the game is the soundtrack and the characters which might be the best in gaming history.,10,2024-05-20,PLAYSTATION 5,user

BTGG,"I didn't want to stop playing. Great character moments. Combat is impactful and fun. The music and voices are arguably the best in the business. Although...PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE..... Allow some free exploration in the next one. Let me be SURPRISED by a boss or by a hidden treasure. Not that Star Ocean: The Divine Force is a better game, because it's a 6.5/10. But in that game, there were unmarked places I could go and find a giant elemental or a giant killer flower to fight. Why does that game draw me into its world better...even though that world is boring and empty. Give the game some level of unknown and mix it with occasional guidance moments. I love this game!",10,2024-05-19,PLAYSTATION 5,user

PMG-Writer,"""Final Fantasy VII Rebirth"" brings you lots of content and good new approaches. You'll be able to spend many hours on the PlayStation 5. The storyline is simply epic and can convince every second. Unfortunately, the distance from one point to the next is simply too long and the landscape, while pretty, is rather empty and dull. The mini-games also get annoying after a while, but are very entertaining at the beginning. On the other hand, the combat system scores points again. All in all, ""Final Fantasy VII Rebirth"" is a great game and should be part of every fan's collection.",9,2024-05-19,PLAYSTATION 5,user
ginntonnix,"This game has no business being as good as it is. This is my first review on Metacritic. I don't have as much time for games as I used to have (I played the original FF7 when I was 16) and typically I'll play a game for 2-3 hours and then put it down. I'm 45 hours into FF7:Rebirth now and it still has me hooked. Like, waking up early to play before the kids are up hooked. HIGHLIGHTS: - Extremely high production values throughout - High attention to detail; you can tell the devs did their homework - Great graphics, cinematics, voice acting - Combat is a great blend of action and strategy (not too button mashy, not too slow / plodding) - This is a huge game. There is a ton to uncover. Frankly I feel bad because I'm barely scratching the surface. LOWLIGHTS: - If you are a completionist this game may overstay it's welcome. It's huge and the open world stuff can get tedious. I've mostly focused on the story. - The Rufus fight can ****. - Character designs, while well done, highlight how different things were in the 90s.",10,2024-05-19,PLAYSTATION 5,user

The characters in particular show believable facial expresion and movements + Deep combat and RPG elements + Great cast of characters + Meaningful quests + Epic soundtrack OK: × Graphics and textures are hit and miss sometimes. Some are drop dead gorgeous, but some textures are weirdly low res × Sound mixing can be weird x Minigames are a bit much. Some are very fun. Some have janky controls. BAD - The ending (the last 1 hour or so was a **** wtf sequence) - Cait Sith Shinra Manor sequence Overall a great fantastic game with one of the best character works.

YeShallBeAsGods,Came here to leave my review after hearing that this game is currently being review bombed by people spamming zero scores without even writing a full review. I think that is very sad because Rebirth is a fantastic game. I played this game at release and poured over 100 hours into it.

J-O-DoubleZ,"This game is simply amazing. it is huge, there are so many things to do and it will take you so much time to do them. it justifies its price tag with the amount of content. yes some of them are repetitive, but you find yourself obligated to do them as they are smartly located one step ahead of your current location so you speak to yourself ""why not"" The regions are all well designed and diverse, although some of them are painful to navigate. The music is outstanding and memorable, I would hate Gongaga geographical setup if it was not for its amazing theme. Characters are polished and loveable. I used to hate Yuffie in the original game, but find her endearing here. I applaud the decision of Cait Sith accent, like to hear him speak. My only problem with the game is that I know I can't Platinum it. the amount of mini games and how the controls and rules switch is too much. some are ok but some are impossible. Queen's Blood is a well thought game that I can find myself engage in a lot if it was a mobile app. something else I found irritating but not game breaking is the amount of flying enemies while most of our characters are ground based. I liked to story and how it ended with many theories about its direction toward the third game. As much as I liked Remake, this game took everything good and expanded on it. the question is what can they do to top Rebirth in their third installment.",9,2024-05-18,PLAYSTATION 5,user
doghairdontcare,"FF7Rebirth is without a doubt a great game. It builds on the combat system introduced from FF7Remake with additional characters, giving you great options of team composition. They definitely addressed some of the issues of FF7R difficulty; namely, you don't need to beat the game just to play it on harder than normal -- it comes loaded with a Dynamic difficulty that feels appropriate for a first run-through. There were a number of challenges that you were allowed to take on early as you can, or wait for later to make it easier. I've undoubtedly spent a lot more time stubbornly fighting challenges while underleveled just because I could, and I enjoyed that aspect. There are two things that bog this game down from a perfect score for me. Lore delivery and immersion, and they both are basically hand-in-hand at spoiling the fun. Chadley is almost always in your hair, and it just doesn't make sense. I'd much rather hunt a summon to obtain its materia out in the wild than to obtain them through VR battles. Chadley is nonstop backseating, and I absolutely do NOT like it. It feels like a lazy way to deliver lore instead of having local NPCs deliver lore in given areas. There's also very little incentive to spend your resources because shop NPCs aren't anything special. I'm giving a nod to recent game, Stellar Blade, which provides quests for NPCs & they even unlock different items as you buy things from their store to up the affinity. Nothing of that sort in FF7Rebirth, and it just feels very bland in that regard. Nevertheless, there are a lot of minigames here -- and that can be a good or a bad thing. If you love these types of games, then it'll just plant a smile on your face... unless you're aiming for platinum trophy, then you're in for a lot of pain.",9,2024-05-18,PLAYSTATION 5,user

ShorykenCity,"I really tried to like this game, but I had to put it down. Constantly forcing the player to partake in mini games in order to progress the main plot is not my idea of fun. Im the type that lightly dabbles around in mini games but I never get too involved in them. So needless to say, Rebirth has been an absolute chore for me to play. Once you get to the resort (FF7 fans will know where I’m referring to), the game dials the mandatory mini games up to 11. After a couple hours it just broke me. I disliked the lack of mini games in 16, and now, Rebirth is nothing but mini games. Not to mention the open world is just typical Ubisoft slop from top to bottom. And about 70% of your entire experience will be permanently linked to Chadley because much of the game revolves around him. I would have much preferred a less bloated, more focused experience.",4,2024-05-18,PLAYSTATION 5,user
Zwiodimus,"Changes in the plot are mostly a big minus, one of the most important moments in the game is completely stripped of its meaning thanks to tragic changes. I can recommend the game only for its brilliant graphics, open world, many cool mini-games and great soundtrack pieces, although only those that contain musical motifs from the original. The rest is very average. Graphics: 10/10 Soundtrack 5/10 ( hard to rate in this case ) Story: IT'S A MESS/10 ( it is good as long as it follows the original plot, but when it introduces new changes, it's mostly garbage. I only liked Dyne story changes I guess, they did him justice ) I strongly recommend playing the original before you even consider to play this. Original is still the GOAT. After the original you might also want to play FF VII Crisis core - it's better than this ""remake/rebirth""",5,2024-05-17,PLAYSTATION 5,user

nep321,"I played the original FFVII back in the day so I went into Rebirth having certain expectations and was a bit disappointed with certain aspects of the game. I would not really consider Rebirth to be a remake, but rather an alternative rendition of the original. The graphics and sound are breathtaking although I did have to switch from 'graphics' to 'performance-sharp' mode since 'graphics' mode had a terrible frame rate. Unfortunately, 'performance-sharp' mode introduced some blur, but I did get used to it and the game still looked stunning. Although the sound qualities are excellent, I do feel that there were only a handful of songs that I truly enjoyed. Most songs, unfortunately, did not capture the same feel of the original game, which was dark and serious. But in Rebirth, much of the music casts a more light hearted tone; sometimes quirky or childish, even. Too many songs were ""over"" orchestrated and slow compared to the original. Maybe I'm just not that great at the game, but I had issues with progressing early in the game due to difficulty. I simply could not beat one of the early bosses on normal difficulty, so I had to change it to easy. But then, the game was too easy and essentially became a button masher and made some of the more special abilities less fun to use. On easy difficulty, I was able to progress through the game with no game overs and beat all mandatory bosses on the first attempt, with the exception of the final battle, which I beat on the second attempt. I wish there was a difficulty level between normal and easy. I honestly miss turn-based combat. Although the combat in Rebirth is dynamic and fun, it can feel like a mindless button masher with little strategy or thought required. There's too much going on the screen at once, making it challenging to fully understand what is happening all the time. Multiple characters attacking, numbers popping up, special effects and explosions all over the place. Turn-based was stress-free, organized and strategic. And easy to process. I don't know why Square Enix abandoned turn-based after FFX as that is what made the series great. The story, in my opinion, deviated greatly from the original and not really in a good way. There was a ton of padding and I was ultimately confused and couldn't really understand all that was going on. This is a multiverse plot, so there are multiple plots going on in different times and places with different characters, which confused me even more. Too many cinematics and too much dialog for my liking. I found many aspects of the game's offerings to be unnecessary and worthless. For example, the combat simulator, relationships with other party members, most side quests and I couldn't care less for the card game, Queens Blood. All of this stuff to me is just fluff and padding. It amazes me that Square Enix reimagined a 10-hour segment of the original game and extrapolated it into a 50+ hour playthrough. The game is littered with tons of stupid minigames that are mandatory in most chapters and even one chapter that is mostly minigames. Another chapter is almost entirely a battle arena event. I did enjoy exploring the various regions of the world, which had some fun objectives and discoveries, but they really didn't add too much value since they were mostly optional. I found Chadley to be a very annoying character who interrupted the gameplay on occasion. The game is full of tutorials from start to finish because there are too many complexities to deal with. I found the character building systems to be a bit too complex and hard to understand fully. Experience points, ability points, skill points, weapon level, party level, weapon abilities, folio manuscripts, synergy abilities, synergy skills, materia and a ton of character stats. It's just a bit too much for its own good and to expect the player to articulate everything is too much to ask in my opinion. A game should be enjoyable, not a chore. Also, I did not like the weapon and armor shopping experience. They don't show by how much the weapon or armor stats will change if you equip them. They only show what the stat will be after you equip. This made the equipment shopping experience cumbersome and annoying. Overall, I enjoyed my playthrough of Rebirth but really wish that certain aspects were better. I really feel that Square Enix is just milking the FFVII franchise and turning a 40 hour game into a 120 hour thing with padding, minigames, cinematics and excessive side content.",8,2024-05-17,PLAYSTATION 5,user

No game has ever wowed me as much as this game. Every town, every NPC, every vista, and every interaction between the characters, has been crafted with such care and attention to detail that it is honestly mindblowing that the creators were able to pull this off.

thelegion28,"This was my first Final Fantasy (FF) game and I think I'll never buy any FF game after this series. Square Enix lied on their FAQ saying that ""No, each FINAL FANTASY has its own story, meaning you can start with FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH without ever having played another game in the series."" I played up till chapter 4 in Rebirth, and every other line felt like a reference to something that happened in previous FF7 games. So I went back and played FF7 remake + the Yuffie DLC, and started chapter 4 again till the end of FF7 Rebirth so I could actually felt not left out in the game. The game overall is great until you get to the point of no return. The mini games are fun (especially Queen's Blood), graphics are polished, great haptic feedback, some mystery here and there, and the relationships/banter between the members on your team are fun. It absolutely falls apart at the very end though. I didn't know about the character that dies and apparently it's the most famous video game death is history. When it got to that part, I was just confused. It feels like they were trying to do everything all at once which made it extremely confusing. I read up some explanations for the end but honestly even now I couldn't tell you what they were trying to do. The scene lost all emotional impact because of the way it was structured. It feels like they prioritized trying to throw players who knew what happened off rather than try to write a good story. For players like me who are new to the series, it was just a confusing mess. I hope the final instalment is called ""Final Fantasy 7 Redemption"" because they really need it after that ending.",7,2024-05-17,PLAYSTATION 5,user
gameota,REMAKE時点では、ストーリーやセリフ描写にやや違和感を感じる点がありつつも戦闘システムが非常に良かったが 今回のREBERTHで戦闘システムに更なる改良が重ねられておりとても面白かった ストーリーやキャラクター描写も世界の広大さと比例してかなり深まっておりREMAKEエンディングではあまり感じられ無かったカタルシスを存分に感じられる物になっている。REBERTHの終了時点がゲーム史に残る名シーンなのもあり、かなり難しい改変になりそうだと思ったが流石に原作のインパクトは超えられ無いものの上手く調理出来ていたと思う。 本作発売前までは、続編に4年かかる事に良い印象が無かったが本作終了後は4年で良くここまで作り込めたという感想に落ち着けて非常に嬉しい作品,10,2024-05-16,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Sound and music is amazing as always, with updated versions of the OST. Some will complain about the side quests and mini games, but the majority of these are optional and I actually enjoyed having a reason to spend more time exploring the world, because it's beautiful and the attention to detail is excellent.

Qui2z,"If you have a PS5, DO NOT SKIP ON THE FF7 SERIES! I don't usually bother with dropping a review score for anything, let alone write about it - but this game (and series) deserves infinitely more attention, I genuinely believe this is one of the greatest games ever made. Its predecessor, Remake, was the game that really introduced me to the world of FF7 (I won't pretend to be a long term fan of the original, but if anything it means I'm not over swept with nostalgia which can often influence opinion). I fell in love with the characters and the story, and it very quickly landed itself as one of my favourite games of all time - but there were clear problems that just couldn't be ignored. Rebirth has outdone itself by fixing nearly all of Remake's issues, you could even argue that they've overdone it in many areas. The gameplay is incredible, I would understand why some believe the linearity of Remake is better suited to their preferences, but in my opinion open-zone is a huge step up, and it especially envelops you in this huge world full of life that they've created. I found myself playing Remake again after completing this game, and found that the combat (which was already amazing) was updated even more so in this game. It feels extremely fluid, and the mix of hack-and-slash with rpg control menus should be taken on by other developers/game series immediately, because I really think this is a groundbreaker. As other reviews would suggest, the game is long, and combined with side content, you can very easily find yourself 100+ hours into the game still with much to do. But what annoys me is that many other reviews don't seem to understand what 'side' content actually means. A lot of the complaints about unnecessary filler and mini games can be totally missed out on if you choose to do so, and I didn't find that I had any issues jumping straight to the next part of the story whenever I wanted to. That being said, a lot of the mini games and side missions are awesome, and you'd be playing the game wrong if you didn't try some of them out. The elephant in the room for many, especially those who played the OG, is that the story is not a complete 1:1 - Remaking a game into a trilogy means that there is obviously going to be some filler in between the main story beats from the OG, but after playing all of these games, I feel like the word 'filler' has been given too many negative connotations for no reason here. I have never in my life played a game where it's so clear to see the passion and love from the developers being reflected so well into one place. It never once felt to me like these 'filler' additions to the story were put in place to extend the run time. If anything, they were put in place to extend upon each character's narratives and their relationships, which is so incredibly central to this story. After playing Remake and totally nerding up on all these characters origins/developments in the 4 year gap between the two games, it's amazing to see how deep some of their narratives go, and it has left me feeling empty and impatient in the run up to the final chapter of this trilogy. I have no doubt that doubt that the developers will create something amazing within the next 3-4 years, it truly feels like they're fans just like the rest of us, I just hope that more people take the time to give this series the respect it deserves.",10,2024-05-14,PLAYSTATION 5,user

FindTheFlame,"Final Fantasy VII REBIRTH is not just one of the best Final Fantasy games of all time, but straight up just one of the best games ever made. The sheer amount of quality content, care, attention to detail and pure love put into this game is almost unbelievable, and far beyond what we've come to expect from modern Square games. I can't stress enough just how much stuff is in this game, how often I found myself asking myself ""how is this game even real?"". The game continues from where REMAKE left off and continues to improve on what the first game did best while minimizing what it did wrong. The story and characters are still as intriguing as ever, the music is top tier, the combat is still one of the best combat systems ever made and is improved upon with multitudes of new options and systems you can utilize within it, there are INSANE amounts of side quests that you can choose to engage with including Queens Blood which is so fun that it almost deserves its own game, optional outfits, the materia system that allows for engaging build variety, huge open areas to explore and traverse, different chocobos for each region with different abilities, sidequests that are worth doing and the protorelic quests, etc etc. The game is not without it's flaws however, some of these being pacing issues, certain scenes that felt like they hit harder with the original game, certain game jank that could be polished better like interaction with terrain or specific combat situations, certain mini games that could be better etc. You could also criticize the new elements of the story subjectively, depending on your tolerance for how much you're ok with them adding things that werent in OG (It should be noted however that just like REMAKE, REBIRTH stays more or less faithful to the OG game about 90-95% of the time). But despite it all, the thing about REBIRTH is that its one of those games that does so much right, goes so far and beyond, that the flaws of the game arent significant enough to detract from the game in a meaningful way. No game is without it's flaws, and with REBIRTH, these flaws just dont do enough to bring down the amazing experience it has to offer. All things considered, Final Fantasy VII REBIRTH is just one of the best games I've ever played and one of my favorite gaming experiences ever. Despite it's flaws, REBIRTH constantly tries to give the player something more than required, whether it be a character interaction, a wacky side quest moment, (without spoilers) EVERYTHING they've added into the Junon section. The game constantly tries to do more than what has been asked and the exceptional effort into providing these things all throughout the game that constantly and pleasantly surprise the player does not go unnoticed. Even gushing about all of this in this review doesn't really do this game justice, it's really something that must be experienced firsthand. Every dev that worked on this game should be extremely proud of themselves for what they've put together here, and it really makes me excited for not only Part 3, but for other Final Fantasy games to come. I dont give out this score lightly or often, but Final Fantasy REBIRTH is undoubtedly a 10/10 game.",10,2024-05-14,PLAYSTATION 5,user
Thedoomer11,Like the original ff7 remake the combat is largely held back by trying to throw 50 concepts together that don’t work well with horrible AI under the idea of stopping to switch characters in order to get the party members to do anything which works very poorly for an action game the story is bad constantly trying to make itself a fanfiction the open world is fun for a bit then starts to wear thin and the pacing is hobbit movie levels of bad,5,2024-05-14,PLAYSTATION 5,user

jessej37,"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is Remake, but bigger and better in every dimension. Some have complained that it fails to fully capture the magic of the original Final Fantasy VII, and to those I would say that that is the point. The subtext (and in places the text) of the story are about the fact that a remake can never truly capture the magic of the original, but Rebirth and Remake exist as the best possible attempt. The magic of the original came from the ambiguity. The graphics, the fight scenes, and a lot of the story left a lot to the imagination, so each player would fill in their ideal in each of those spaces. By the nature of being modern day remakes, Remake and Rebirth do not get this luxury. They have to make a choice for what to show in those previously ambiguous spaces, which will inevitably leave some fans wanting. And the developers know this, and they talk about this through the game's story. I am giving this game a 10 because I feel that they made all the right choices in those ambiguous situations. I love the combat. I love the cutscenes. I love the graphics and the characters and the minigames and RPG systems. Others will rate this game low because it is not the remake they imagined. I'm giving this game a 10 because the game they imagine cannot exist. This game does exist, and it is the closest that any game will ever come to that ideal, that any game could ever come to that ideal.",10,2024-05-14,PLAYSTATION 5,user

docnano,"It took me 90 hours to beat Rebirth, and I can't think of the last time I had such a consistently great time spending so long with a single game. The gameplay variety, excellent characters, beautiful world, fleshed out towns, and music (possibly the greatest video game soundtrack of all time) all add up to what I consider Square Enix's greatest masterpiece. This is the most fully realized modern AAA version of the classic console JRPG, and arguably the best Final Fantasy game ever made (I will personally reserve judgment on whether it beats the original FF7 until I see how the story resolves in part 3). While the game takes place in an open world, it has a linear story that you can progress pretty quickly if you don't feel like exploring and doing side quests. However, I do recommend doing at least most of the side quests because they expand the main characters in pretty meaningful ways, and have a lot more variety than just ""go to this location and kill this monster."" Every aspect of the game was crafted with such care and attention to charm the player at every turn that it's kind of mind-boggling. As a Final Fantasy 7 fan, I couldn't be happier with Rebirth. The ending has disappointed some people, but as I came to understand its meaning I think it's actually quite brilliant. And there are several completely new scenes that weren't in the original FF7, but are easily as emotionally moving as anything in the original.

LordVeg,"Almost Perfect. But!!! 1. Slow walking - Speed up slow walks and chocobo climbing by about 50%. In some cases it's unbearable. Perhaps change the camera angle or add flashing images to those instances to keep interest. 2. Side quests - Too many towers, not enough secrets. 3. Gameplay - The combat is faster, weightier, more elaborate than Remake. The next one needs to allow character swap and full character materia swap. Treat Weapon fights like FF16. 4. Music - Keep it up 5. Minigames - Cut about 1/3 of them. Expand chocobo racing, Fort Condor, Queen's Blood, and even the Frog Fall Guy's ripoff. Have Cait Sith's box **** as a non-essential game at the Gold Saucer. 6. Cutscenes - Keep it **** fact get rid of about 50% of the slow walking segments and make them cutscenes. 7. Lighting - More night time/dusk/magic hour.. Full Daylight does not do this game any favors. City of the Ancients was as washed out as a Presidential cum stain. Length - Add about 5 hours of more main story and subtract about 10 hours of side filler.",10,2024-05-10,PLAYSTATION 5,user
epicbro,"Characters and Combat. Utterly fabulous. They need to ease back on the checklist questing and allow some free discovery...""ohh look there's a **** no a **** **** gives me ridiculous XP?""

chus456,"Amazing game! As a fan of the OG, it has met the expectations, even over them.

El_guapote,"El juego está increíble. Tiene bastante contenido y siempre se siente que encuentras algo nuevo para hacer. El sistema de combate está muy bien pulido y es fácil de aprender. La dificultad es difícil cuando tiene que ser difícil, pero en general no es complicado. La historia te atrapa desde el principio y es un gran acierto que no sea 100% fiel al original, sino que se siente como un what if. En definitiva es de los mejores juegos que he jugado en la vida.",10,2024-05-10,PLAYSTATION 5,user

It has everything you need, a game that once you are done it leave you empty as it is hard to play anything else. Few flaws as it has too many minigames that can make you feel overwhelmed and the platinum is exhausting (mostly due to minigames) but aside of that, simple perfect. The way they develop the characters is great, more in deep knowledge from OG FFVII and stunning open world",9,2024-05-10,PLAYSTATION 5,user

From the depth of the gameplay, the writing for most parts of the story was great, the writing of the characters is phenomenal, the amazing music track that dynamically changes to fit the situation in most situations, only to name a few that elevates this entire experience. Despite the drawbacks this game has with it's pacing, some poorly optimized mini games, slow walking sections, throwing boxes, and very minor nuances, this is a must recommend. $70 is worth spending money on, especially if you've played Remake (part 1).",10,2024-05-09,PLAYSTATION 5,user

It has some flaws, like every other game in existence but not really worth mentioning when the fact that what it does right overshadows it completely.

Zeroseph77,"This game is the reason why you should always take reviews with a grain of salt. Most people are clearly giving playing this with nostalgia goggles on. This game had the potential to be great if it merely followed the formula remake set and gave us more of the same, instead they decided to give us copious amount of filler content and meaningless side quests with a little bit of story sprinkled in. As someone who primary plays this type of game for story and gameplay it was frustrating. I have no interest in luring chickens or activating breath of the wild towers or playing rocket league (yes these are all actually things you do in this game). The story is now also taking a turn into marvel cinematic universe and it’a hack writing, which is odd considering the original final fantasy 7 had one of the best stories of all time. The graphics have taken a huge step back, when the original FF7 remake came out we were all impressed by the graphics and understood why it had to run at 30fps due to the limitations of the PS4. Well, with rebirth the game is still at 30 fps or you can play the game at 60fps in one of the blurriest and ugly looking performance modes I have seen. The gameplay is the exact same thing as remake, they added tag team moves the feel like an afterthought, the aren’t impactful and honestly they just give you something different to do in battle other than mashing square. But like the original game the entire game can be beat by mashing square and summoning, assuming you aren’t under leveled. The music and audio in this game are incredible and honestly the best part of the game. All of the well known FF7 tracks have been remade and sound better than ever before. In conclusion, this game is a blatant money grab cashing in on nostalgia. Final fantasy 16 is a better game is every way other than music. After playing this I have zero interest in the third game. If I want my final fantasy 7 fix I will stick the original and remake part 1.",0,2024-05-09,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Mo22Agilah,"Rebirth is blast the story expands on the Remake in every way. As a fan of the og I was miffed with the changes towards the Remakes end. But the manner in which they played up clouds unreliable narrative, yuffies non optional joining of the party and this sections focus on the black robed men were nothing short of phenomenal. For all the complaints I see about the side content and so called bloat is really disingenous. In each open world area there is a new mode of transport, the side content for the most part is optional and adds to the story and character relationship the heart of the game. The towers unlocking for the region are optional and all others can be found organically if so desired. The story changes for the most part to only expand small sections of the game or generally improve on the original. The ending is confusing but it is literally intended that way and I believe will pay off to the big reveal related to cloud in pt3. And chadley just isn't as annoying as people say, there is plenty of endgame content to engage with. My only nitpick would of been playable Vincent and Cid but they made some interesting story changes and have well set them up for the future introduction. My goty for sure, would I of liked a 1:1 remake yes but I am enjoying what we got and the story will ultimately end still making advent children cannon. We should wait to see how the cards are played before writing off anything that has been laid down.",10,2024-05-09,PLAYSTATION 5,user

RefinedInsights,"Lots and lots of cutscenes, filler dialogue,endless minigames, clunky combat. This game had potential but geez why did they have to ruin it with less of a focus on story and gameplay and more of a focus on pointless mini games. The story is incredibly repetitive, seeing Sephiroth with his sinister smile and chuckle taunting Cloud every 5 minutes started to feel less like a treat and more like a chore. Combat was very flashy and felt less fluid than I would like. Overall I would call it a somewhat below average game with potential.",6,2024-05-08,PLAYSTATION 5,user

tensioly,"Tras el éxito de Final Fantasy VII Remake venía con muchas ganas de jugar a su secuela, y debo decir que ha cumplido mis expectativas con creces. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth es la continuación de una fantástica aventura que nos transporta al planeta de Gaia, donde la energía del planeta está siendo explotada y consumida por una empresa que gobierna la sociedad y nuestro grupo protagonista busca pararle los pies a la misma y al villano principal: Sefirot. A pesar de que la historia no tiene un hilo principal sobre el que tirar al principio del juego, conforme va avanzando la trama mejora sustancialmente. Lo mejor de este apartado son sus personajes, cada uno con una personalidad muy definida y arcos muy interesantes, permitiéndonos empatizar y encariñarse de ellos. A esto le sumamos un lore complejo y ampliado, que le otorga al mundo mucho más contexto e inmersión. La historia, que me ha durado unas 68 horas habiendo hecho parte del contenido secundario, viene acompañada por un apartado audiovisual excelso, llegando a una calidad gráfica pocas veces vista y escenas y animaciones espectaculares; con una magnífica banda sonora y a mí parecer una de las mejores de toda la historia. Desafortunadamente tuve que jugar al juego a 30 FPS en modo calidad porque el modo rendimiento perdía mucha resolución. La jugabilidad sigue siendo muy divertida, al igual que en el Remake, pero con adiciones y cambios que le han otorgado un enfoque distinto y mejora con respecto al anterior. Los combates son entretenidos y la estructura de mundo abierto le sienta como anillo al dedo. Los encargos y misiones secundarias suelen ser de mucha calidad, con algunas excepciones de algunas misiones tediosas de hacer o exceso de encargos en algunas ocasiones. Hay una cantidad inimaginable de minijuegos, todos ellos con sus mecánicas únicas y que dan un soplo de aire fresco a la jugabilidad. Mención especial al juego de cartas, probablemente de los minijuegos más divertidos y adictivos que he jugado nunca. En resumen, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth mejora a su juego anterior y consigue estar a la altura de lo esperado, consiguiendo una aventura emocionante e imprescindible para cualquier fan de la saga.9,5/10(05/2024)",10,2024-05-07,PLAYSTATION 5,user
FiSterne,"What an game what an ending️ I love fight in this game and the story All the side quests is amaizing , and fun All your relationships are appreciated and taken care of.

Thatguy42,"Mixture of excellent graphics and music, but also bad gameplay and far, far too long. I'll start with the good: 1. Music 10/10 The music is easily a 10/10. If you love the original FF7 soundtrack, you will love this remaster with endless versions of the songs you love. The new tracks are also well-done. Overall perfect. This is not music, but I also want to note the voice acting is good. Games like BG3 have raised the bar on voice acting, but FF7 Rebirth executes voice acting competently. 2. Graphics 9/10 The game looks amazing. The worlds are lush and variable. I did not experience any graphical glitches, which is impressive considering the size of the game. There are many cut scenes, even for side content. 3. Gameplay 2/10 Combat is bad. Combat is active and you build up a meter over time to do attacks and magic. Every concession to turn this game from a turn-based RPG to an active battle system benefits the monsters instead of the players. The only way to get a reprieve from difficult monsters is to fill a bar, but that is generally just a damage sponge. Overall, most boss fights are long and boring as you slowly fill a bar so you can finally do damage. Square should take notes from Elden Ring if it wants to do active combat, because this is not it. Further, when things start going bad in combat, it spirals quickly as you need to fill your meter before using items or healing magic. The ai for your team members is braindead in combat. FF7 Rebirth also has giant open worlds. They look great, but they are boring. These pad out the game to double or triple its natural length with little new added for the player. Combat issues aside, FF7 Rebirth is far too long and far too little happens to make it worth its length. This game would have been good at 20-40 hours, but at 80-120 hours it is a slog.",5,2024-05-07,PLAYSTATION 5,user
JosePhCyto,"Muy buena secuela, buena historia, buena música & de la manera que va contando cada historia de cada personaje es perfecta es sin duda alguna de los mejores titulos para la franquicia FF.

BRY9-5000,Incredible game. Improved everything from Part 1 with maybe the best combat I've ever experienced in a single player game. The soundtrack is a monumental achievement; it's such a huge game and yet new high quality tracks keep coming the whole way.

Thepredator91,"In one word: Masterpiece. I didn't think I would ever play another Final Fantasy that would become my new favorite. But Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth really succeeded. And how! Visually, this game is an artistic masterpiece with beautiful cutscenes, beautiful environmental settings in a rich living world. Putting the power of the PS5 to full use. Both in the graphics and in the use of the SSD. The various large areas in FF7R load quickly, which really gives the feeling that you are playing in a large open world. Besides the splendor, the script is also at its best. Interesting side quests with stories and missions that you could easily expect in the main quest line. Nice dialogues with the emphasis on getting to know all the characters well. So that by the end of the game you have really built a bond. This is something that many games could learn from. This edition of FF7 has a beautiful soundtrack that does justice (and then some) to the original. The different variations of the Cosmo Canyon area and Aerith's theme make you just stop the game to enjoy the soundtrack. The combat is fast and relatively easy to get into, but difficult to master. It uses an active ATB system where you hack and slash to build up a ATB bar. Once filled up, you can use a ability. There are fights where I had to try a few times to make it. The difficulty level is certainly not too easy, but that is a good thing. Too easy isn't good either (ahem.. FF16...). There where only two fights that where kinda annoying (ahem.. President... Ahem.. boms Aerith...,) but it didnt take away my overall enjoyment of the game. It took me nearly 84 hours to complete the main game, the environmental missions and most of the side quests. But that doesn't mean there's nothing left to do. I think it will take you about 110 hours to complete everything. I just can't say anything negative about this game. From start to finish it shines with beautiful graphics/cutscenes, a good story, fun mini-games, a beautiful soundtrack, a challenging battle system. A lot of bang for your buck. This is what a true AAAA should look like.. (you reading this Ubisoft?) Normally I don't say a game is perfect, but you don't get any closer than this. 10/10! A must play for anyone who enjoys action, adventure and RPG games.",10,2024-05-06,PLAYSTATION 5,user

JawnWilkesBooth,"Remake was a terrific game, but Rebirth is a masterpiece. The expansion on the OG story, the huge, beautiful zones… It’s everything I imagined the world to be in my childhood, playing OG, come to life. The combat is so well-polished and the itemization/customization with gear and materia is beautifully balanced with the gameplay. It really makes me wonder what the dev team on XVI was thinking, making their game so shallow when you have the proper blend of action and RPG itemization in the 7r releases. The only complaint I have is that some of the mini games just aren’t for me. Out of the dozens offered, a few of them miss the mark. Oddly, it comes down to there just being too many mini games and they’re all unique enough that you just wind up with some that click for the player and some that don’t. In general, that’s not really a problem (the ones I dislike make up a fraction of a % of the gameplay), but the issue is that the platinum trophy is locked behind some of these. I can live without it, but it’s a little disappointing. So far, I’ve put about 150 hours in since release - quite an undertaking when you have two small children. This game has absorbed all my free time when the kids are in bed, I’ve lost some sleep to get through certain challenges and story beats, but this game has been one of the few in years that was worth full retail value at launch. Part 3 can’t come soon enough!",10,2024-05-06,PLAYSTATION 5,user
AdrianOfSweden,"I played the original FFVII when I was a teen, and the game has since lived on in my mind and in my heart. The remake does not disappoint, especially Rebirth, which gave me the opportunity to visit and experience even more places that I hold dear. With a great balance between serious issues and quirkiness, with good graphics and wonderful music, I'm wholeheartedly enjoying playing this game (50 hours in, not sure when it ends yet). Not a 10 from me, because there are some very odd graphic issues that I'd expect seasoned developers to not have left in the game, like lighting issues in doorways, and that a character can push away huge debris as if they were made of foam. Nothing detrimental to the overall experience, since the high grade from me.",9,2024-05-06,PLAYSTATION 5,user

kanaex,16の時もそうでしたが最初が一番面白い。今回も体験版に騙されました。 カームの街に到着しフィールドに出た時は本当にワクワクしました。しかしジュノンエリアが終わる頃には同じことの繰り返しだと気付き熱が冷めてしまいました。 今作はオープンフィールドを謳っていますが、プレイ感はシームレスなミッションクリア型ゲームです。 基本的に毎度親切に表示されるマーカーの出ているところに行くだけのおつかいゲームで自分で切り拓く感は皆無です。 歩き回って特徴的な場所に着いてもクエストを受けていなければ何も起こりません。クエストを受注しマーカーが出てから行けばそれでいいのです。 マーカーを辿れば必然的にマップの隅から隅まで行くことになります。 それに探索するワクワク感も無ければ緊張感や恐怖感もありません。敵は弱く、こちらから仕掛けなければ襲われることはほぼありませんし、強敵にいたってはわざわざ呼び出さなければ現れもしません。 オープンワールドに大切な偶然性、例えば森に迷い込み見たことのない巨大な熊に襲われることや、道中モンスターに占拠された砦を発見し攻略方法について思案をするなど（もちろん実際には偶然ではなくプログラムされたイベントであるが、偶然性を演出している）、そこに着いてから発生する事態に対応するような場面が無く、ただマーカーを追うだけの作業になっています。 それらの要素で広大なフィールドが単なる面倒な移動に成り下がってしまっています。 エルデンリングや、ゼルダの伝説、最近ではドラゴンズドグマ2のような冒険感は得られませんでした。 戦闘はアクション要素がありますが、基本的にはボタン連打をしATBゲージが溜まれば敵の弱点をつく強力な攻撃を叩き込むの繰り返しで、実はアクション要素は薄いです。 プレイヤースキルでどうにかできる場面はほとんどありません。 途中途中挟まれるミニゲームは完成度の低い物が多く、それでいてストーリーに強制的に挿入されることが非常に多く進行の妨げになるばかりか、しっかりと操作とルールを覚えなければクリアできないものが多くストレスが溜まりました。 キャラクターは一人一人掘り下げられておりそのストーリーは良くできています。この辺はお手のものですね。 今作では特にバレットに好感が持てました。 しかしヒロイン陣は全員好きになれませんでした。可愛さを全面にアピールしているのが見え見えでそれが痛々しく逆にしらけてしまいました。 ぶりっ子ユフィーは写実的なグラフィックに似つかわしくないオーバーアクションと時代遅れのリアクションで世界観の崩壊さえ招いています。元祖あざと系女子エアリスはリメイクの時よりもさらに磨きがかかっており見ていられない、、、唯一まともだと思っていたティファはエアリス憑きに感染しておりやはり見ていられない。 後半ではプレイ時間よりもカットシーンの方が長くただただ見ているだけという場面が多かったです。キャラクターを好きになれていないと正直きついでしょう。 カットシーンによる演出は好き嫌いが別れるところだと思います。 ストーリーを盛り上げるために必要なのかも知れませんが、今作で完結しない本作では功を奏しているようには思えませんでした。 最後に、私はオリジナルの7をリアルタイムで楽しんだファンの一人ですが、今作最も残念だったのが何でもありのぶっ壊れた世界観です。 ファンタジーと現代とSFがゴッチャになっており正直これが最も没入感を削ぎしらけてしまった要因です。 オリジナルの7ではスチームパンクとファンタジーが融合した世界に見えましたがグラフィックが綺麗になり再現された世界は悪い意味でのパラレルワールドです。 どちらかと言うと文明が極度に発達した未来の物語でジャンルはSFです。 後半に出てくるドラゴンはドラゴンの形をしたクリーチャーにしか見えませんでした。 同じリメイク作品で比較するとバイオハザードシリーズのような正統進化ではなく全く別の作品になっていたのが往年のファンとしては不満でした。 大人向けの内容ではないので、若い新規プレイヤーにとっては非常に親切で良く作り込まれた大ボリュームの傑作であるのは間違いないので全否定するつもりはありません。 ただ「期待はずれだった」という個人の感想です。 ここまで述べておきながら恐縮ですが最後までそれなりに楽しんでプレイしました。多くの不満点がありながらも今作で完結していれば満足のいく作品になっていたかと思います。今作をプレイし私は残念ながら次回作を購入する意欲は無くなりました。,3,2024-05-05,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Story got a bit confusing at the very end, had to watch a few youtube vids discussing the ending to really grasp it.

HiFlyGuyKai,"This game is a rollercoaster, and not in the good way. The main story has the weirdest pace and side quests in the first three quarters of the game seem disconnected from anything the characters actually should be focusing on. Normally, this isn’t a big deal, but these intel missions, mini games, side quests and card battles take a LONG time to run through. In a nutshell, you get to a new area, beat the mandatory part of the main campaign, then you’re free to explore the massive area. While you’re exploring, you’ll run into a cycle of intel missions that repeat throughout each area. Very rarely are these challenging or interesting, they just feel like things you HAVE to do. These can take several hours to complete, which ends up feeling more like a chore than actual exploration. Ultimately, these are optional, but they also help with gear, experience and fast traveling, almost to the point where they feel mandatory. Most quests have a recommended level, which you most likely won’t achieve if you just do good old fashioned grinding. I know I’m taking a lot of time explaining the problems with the side grind, but this makes up a MASSIVE part of both the game and the issues that it has. The main story is… good. I feel like the writers were torn between retaining a lot of the story beats from the PS1 FF7 to the big changes they made in Remake. The phrase “you can’t have your cake and eat it, too” comes to mind when looking at the two directions this game clearly wants to go in. PS1 FF7 is at it's heart a bunch of well written individual character stories woven together with an overarching goal to save the world. While even the original misses this mark from time to time, this is extremely noticeable in FF7R where it feels like major character moments feel fragmented and at times completely disconnected from the journey that we originally started on. While side quests (at times) do their best to tie in more elements of the world and characters, many of these moments fail to do so in any meaningful way. On a positive note, there are some standout individual moments that range from amazing to adorable (Kupo!). When the story is going, it’s pretty good, not anything groundbreaking, but it does a good job at making big moments hit. Graphics and Gameplay are easily the best part of this game. You can really tell the designers put a lot of care into every detail of combat and recreating these iconic locations. Combat remains similar to Remake (if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it) and only seems to improve upon what was already one of the more innovative combat systems **** new synergy abilities add a nice flair to combat, and adding elemental abilities the don’t require MP is a quality of life change for the better. There is a good variety of enemies to fight, most having a good balance between active combat and strategic defense. Each of the main cast has a unique play style that allows for a lot of expression for those willing to experiment and practice. Bosses and summons still feel great to fight (and use) and limit breaks come at a pretty good rate without feeling spammy. Overall, you’ll never feel bored when you’re in combat and the visuals of the towns and iconic areas all keep you engaged. That being said, some elements of gameplay that can be improved are exploration and level design. The “Dungeons” in this game have extremely simple puzzles and platforming that feel more like a nuisance than a challenge, which is a notable drop in quality from Remake, which at least had competent puzzles that had elements of fun. Adding a vacuum cleaning section or raising the water level aren’t new, challenging or exciting gameplay elements, they actually stifle the flow of the action. These puzzles needed a bit more complexity for the sake of interest. I’m saying all this as a fan of both FF7 PS1 and Remake, this game was cool, but overall disappointing. This “Jack of all trades, master of none” approach ended up feeling like the most hollow game with so much “content”. I think the word of the day is “Cohesion”. This game failed to bring its many (and I mean MANY) of its different pieces together to flow cohesively. Rebirth is a mile wide and an inch deep on almost every level except for combat and visuals. I think they should look at what made Remake work so well and find a middle ground between these two to create a truly amazing experience. To be fair to Rebirth, the middle of FF7 PS1 is probably the weakest part of the game (FF7 is at it’s best and the very beginning and the very end), so there did have to be a lot of padding to cover ground. What this game does establish is the bonds between the cast (still needs improvement) and that will serve as the foundation for the final entry into the series. There’s still hope for part three, but Square will need to learn from it’s mistakes for a true Rebirth.",6,2024-04-30,PLAYSTATION 5,user

But what truly makes this title shine is its narrative, which manages to captivate and move the player from start to finish.

And finally, this game is more than the sum of all it's masterful parts, this game has so much soul that I have haven't found in any other game.

iMustang,"I do not exaggerate when I say Final Fantasy VII Remake is one of my favorite games of all time, one I played through a second time only a year after release because I loved it so much when replaying games at all is a rarity for me let alone so quickly. The music became one of my favorite soundtracks, the character interactions were some of the best I'd ever had the pleasure of witnessing, the visuals and storytelling blew me away, and overall the game was so fun to play. Needless to say my excitement for the next part in the story, Rebirth, has been on a nonstop hype-train for 4 years now. To say that excitement was met would be an understatement, and to say it was exceeded still feels too small a word. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth **** the definition of expectations to me, giving me a phenomenon beyond my wildest hopes and dreams. This journey was an experience, and one that will no doubt define one of my best memories of this year. It is truly impossible for me to list everything that makes Rebirth a masterpiece to me, I have no doubt I would run out of characters before I was even halfway done. Speaking about it as a sequel may be the greatest way to give proper praise because this may be the greatest sequel to a game I've ever played. Transitioning from a linear story to an open world adventure is the greatest achievement Rebirth makes and you're greeted with this from the beginning. Being able to select your own party compositions, travel the world visiting towns and chocobo ranches, and yet still engage in the same style of combat is an amazing feat I was so impressed the developers could achieve. Having a sense of familiarity with weapon abilities and materia customization yet a new feeling of finding groups of monsters in the world to battle is a fantastic sensation, and that's not even considering the new visually pleasing combo attacks party members can do together. Even your party members who aren't selected still assist in battles and roam the open world with you which is incredible to see executed to seamlessly. Gaining access to the open world segment of the original game was already amazing for it's time and with dozens of baby chocobos to help, side quests to find with occasional reoccurring characters from Remake, and summons to unlock, Rebirth has recreated that breathtaking feeling all over again with the icing of the cake of variants to the beautiful over-world theme. The colorful open world may be the way this entry shines, but the narrative is the soul of what takes that concept to greatness. All cinematic bits continue to be at their finest, but playing through them really shows the heart of what makes Final Fantasy VII so great. Revisiting Costa Del Sol and Cosmo Canyon in their remade glory, infiltrating Rufus' ceremony and going on a date at the Gold Saucer, and meeting some of the dynamic members of the cast like Cait Sith or Vincent Valentine. These were all beloved parts of the original game that I was so excited to experience again and Rebirth took it's time exploring each one making them stand out and really leave a lasting impression. No area or story arc ever felt rushed or lackluster, always filled with various mini-games and plenty of content to make each location stand proudly on it's own. Even connections to Crisis Core were perfectly woven into the narrative, proving even if I was excited for the things I expected to see, there were always plenty of unexpected surprises waiting for me. The spirit of what made Final Fantasy VII so great is entirely revived in Rebirth. The colorful, fun, sometimes whacky, imaginative and creative spirit is all there. Odd monsters, posing like a cactuar, hilarious one-liners, over the top character introductions, all still intact. Yet there are still emotional moments, both good feels and tear jerking alike. Stunning, epic moments like seeing an iconic location for the first time or seeing the party members in one of the many breathtaking cutscenes. Rebirth still carries that passion, those loud vibrant colors, the phenomenal soundtrack, the story beats of an amazing odyssey, all while expanding on the original foundation, adding even more depth to characters and their motivations, and taking many new creative liberties that once again gave me some of my new best memories in gaming. I could go on about my favorite parts of the game, my love of Yuffie and Vincent being incorporated into the main story, the new characters or the wonderful moments with Aerith & Tifa, or how the chapter may be one of my new favorite boss fights in game history. However this really was how I could best express my heart-filled delight with this game in as few words as possible. If Final Fantasy VII Remake was a masterpiece to me, then Final Fantasy VII Rebirth was a game that somehow surpassed a masterpiece, and will once again be one I remember as one of the greatest games- no, experiences, of my entire life.",10,2024-04-26,PLAYSTATION 5,user
SedSays,"Absolutely love this game, easily my game of the year without question. This core game is far better than anyone could have expected, and they've addressed a lot of issues with the previous game in the series with regards to aerial combat, side quests padding, etc. Not without it's flaws. Considering how good the main game is, the sheer mediocrity of the mini games is really disappointing. I'd much rather they not be there, even if they tug at some nostalgia for the original game, if they're going to be so poorly executed. This is especially true when so many of them are gate ways to a lot of the ""end game"" content: recipes or materials needed for crafting, materia needed for good builds, etc. I came into Rebirth thinkingIwould for sure 100% everything, but dealing with these minigames has actually pushed me away from even doing the things I enjoyed doing. To be fair I'm also 100+ hours into the game and was always going to burn it eventually. Just sooner than I would have liked.",8,2024-04-25,PLAYSTATION 5,user
Talitor,"*Very slight spoilers ahead for those that have not completed Remake Part 1* Final Fantasy VII Rebirth was so much more than I could have ever asked for, and it's an experience that has stuck with me ever since I fully completed it. My mind just keeps coming back to it. Bear in mind, I liked Remake, but I was disappointed; it didn't quite hit all the notes I expected it to. Rebirth pulled me back with full force, with improved, deeper combat, engaging open world, a soundtrack that is truly to die for, and both continuation and a remake of a beloved original. The quality of content in Rebirth is absolutely astonishing. I know this sounds like being a giddy fanboy, but it really is that good. Bear in mind I've felt the quality of new FF games hasn't been up to par the last 20 years, but now we finally went back and perhaps even past the quality we came to expect from this beloved series. First and foremost; while Remake trilogy is a remake of the original, it is also a sequel. For best experience, you'll need to understand the source material to get what they're going for here. It's a weird feeling to play this game with the exact same expectation of unknown yet in many ways familiar of the original game from 1997. It manages to bring that same feel of ""I want to see what happens next!"", even if we already know most of it. The game does just enough new things to tie the whole FFVII legacy into the original game, and also to fill some plot holes and relatively poorly developed plot points of the 1997 experience. The game gives you so many clues, yet refuses to give full answers just yet; which is great. I don't remember a single game in my adult life that left me with such a long lasting impression, and I am hard to please with modern gaming. I can hardly wait for Part 3. If you are on the edge on buying Rebirth after being perhaps disappointed by Remake, buy it. If you loved FFVII, you will most likely love this game, and by the end of it you'll understand exactly why.",10,2024-03-24,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Danilo_HC,"This game is a disappointment, a disrespect to the 1997 game and to FF VII fans. Square lies when sells it as a remake, but the truth is that it is a reimagining or continuation, confusing and meaningless. They had all the great material from the original and the compilation on their hands, but decided to change the story we love, creating a soulless salad with dementors of fate straight from Harry Potter, multiverse and time travel that make you think you're watching a movie from Marvel. These elements were never part of the FFVII universe, of any game, film, animation or novel. Just like in part 1 of this remake, the game itself is not bad, it has good graphics, although in some parts the quality is good and in others bad, the combat is fun and the expanded lore is very good, but the filler moments that I mentioned, which are not part of FFVII, are depressing and seem like a foreign body within the game, and the ending of this game is not satisfactory or rewarding, on the contrary, it causes disgust and repulsion, just like the ending of part 1. Square managed the feat of ruining the most iconic scene in the entire franchise, this fake remake is an affront to the hope that every Final Fantasy VII fan had of one day seeing the masterpiece made in 1997 modernized.",2,2024-03-30,PLAYSTATION 5,user

I understand that some people may not like the changes in the story, but that is subjective. Objectively, this game is fun, made with a lot of love, and is very refined in every aspect. Also, not a minor detail, this game perfectly captures that ""adventure"" feeling we can find in old JRPGs - something that is almost lost in the new generation of games.

MrGamesReviewer,"The short: For anyone wanting to know what the fuss of FF7 was all about, play the original FF7. The long: Finaly Fantasy VII Rebirth is a mostly gorgeous game with a lot of wonderful music. Unfortunately, in the grande scheme of things, it is still a significantly lesser game than the original it emulates, and a sad let-down following the far better-paced Remake. Many parts of the original FF7 are excluded, mini-games are often outright awful, frequently lacking sufficient explanation, sporting janky controls, and playability that truly should have heads rolling at the company. The overall gameplay quickly gets repetitive as each world section is essentially just repeating the previous one in a new biome, which unfortunately gets real old, real fast. Remake had me eagerly looking forward to Rebirth, and Rebirth (which doubles down on many of its more child focused features—for the love of all that is holy, let me disable Mai) now has me no longer looking forward to part three (I am definitely not counting down the days like I did for Remake and Rebirth). For anyone wanting to know what the fuss of FF7 was all about, play the original FF7. Much of Remake and Rebirth are exactly what I had hoped for in an updated FF7 for next gen consoles, but for whatever reason Square Enix decided to reimagine the game, complete with altering the story, omitting many of the best parts of the original and injecting new often completely pointless ones, piling on the mini-games, and making battle mechanics a frustratingly buggy fest of sudden cutscenes that negate your actions while still consuming your ATB and limit breaks. I have lost count how many times I've selected an action only to have my ATB subtracted without receiving an action. Cast a spell? No, because it's cut-scene or enemy animation. Use an item? No, because cut-scene. Land that limit break? No, because cut-scene. Never mind the outright disrespectfully unskippable scenes you've seen for the nth time but still for some godforsaken reason aren't allowed to skip. Then there’s hard mode, which just feels like the laziest possible implementation possible, upping the damage taken, removing the ability to use items altogether, only resulting in asking myself time and again “why am I still getting items”, and “what is the point of money”, “why waste AP on materials like Item Master”, and more. Despite the world being large, it feels empty. There are vast spaces to explore, but there is by and large nothing in it. Perhaps, though, this was the point all along. To change the game enough to safely ensure that the original FF7 will live on as the undisputed masterpiece it was and still is, never to be overshadowed by the new versions. Or perhaps Rebirth simply lays bare that Square Enix is not the company it once was, these days simply incapable (even with a proven script/blueprint on hand) of producing new timeless gems, dooming Rebirth to follow the pattern of pretty much every other ""open world"" post IX Final Fantasy game, that also fail to achieve the iconic status their predecessors regularly did.",7,2024-04-24,PLAYSTATION 5,user

virtualvince,"Oh wow, 4 years ago on release I reviewed FF7 Remake. At the time I liked it, even really liked it, but I found it really flawed as well, more so than some in mainstream media, or in general. It mainly came down to its very bad side quests though in hindsight, I'm not a fan of the game forcing slow walk/movement sections (Rebirth still has this). And here we have part 2, ""Rebirth"". What did I think? A total game-changer taking what worked in part 1 and expanding it, making it better, making it more challenging, and completely ramping up the quality of all side-content everywhere which ranges from card game mini-games through Fall Guys like games, racing games, space invader games, fighting games... it's absolutely insane, and that's not even barely touching the surface. I love the story, even the timey-wimey seemingly confusing stuff. It's there to provoke conversation. I just want to know how it ends, and where it's going, which will be another 3 or 4 years. Also, this game is loooong. There's massive open world sections and more linear dungeon/cave stuff as well, but it all makes sense and works. You can artificially make the game short by skipping all the cut scenes and ignoring 80% of the game but for everybody else who will play normally, expect a 100 hour first run, easily, and anywhere from 150-200 hour 100% game completion run for a platinum trophy achievement. There's some HARD challenges in there, we're talking going to YouTube and seeking out every cheese strat imaginable to make it easy on yourself hard. In spite of some flaws still (the forced slow walking/movement sections, some annoying NPC's making a reappearance, repeating un-skippable dialogue), this game has too much going for it to make it anything other than an easy 10. And I don't know how they will ever top this in part 3 but they will no doubt will try. Did I mention the amazing music soundtrack? Holy smokes, a 10/10 easy.",10,2024-04-23,PLAYSTATION 5,user

I like my jrpgs to lead story and characters first, whereas Square Enix has chosen that open world check lists and mini games must make up the bulk of the experience.

A lot of care was put into this by the creators, it is not a cheap multiverse that diminishes your favorite cast of characters and the story of the OG. Please give it a chance, games like this need to sell well to continue to be published.",10,2024-04-22,PLAYSTATION 5,user
TarquiF,"I had the oportunity to play this gameday 1 and it was an experience that for me, goes toe to toe with the things I felt when playing Metal Gear 3 and Red Dead Redemption 2 for the first time, Here goes my review. As I always do, I'll start with graphics. Everything in the game looks completely amazing, visual effects are enhaced from the Remake, cinematics have excellent transitions from ingame to pre rendered and every single aspect of the world, characters and combat animations look incredible. Now the different mappings are another aspect to take into account when speaking about design and graphics. In this case, every single map is pretty detailed, and most importantly, beautiful. The game has an unbelievable variety when it comes to maps, from beaches to deserts, through ponds, lakes, hills and forests, some more dense than the other and some easier to travel than the others (I dont hate Gongaga). Each of the maps has its own mechanics and ways to travel around, design is very cool in general. Enemies are also some things that are worthy of mention here, cause every single design is really great and has a lot of detail, and also every single type of enemy has different ways to face it, amazing graphic and combat design. I do have to say that I miss the blueish industrial look Remake had, but I also like what we got here, a real look to the nature. Now the music made for this game is truly a masterpiece, and I can sayh the same about sound design. Every single song that poped up was extremely accurate with was happening at the moment (ba wawau ba wawau). Combats had the most epic songs, character had their own emotional themes, and the different important bosses had their menacing and entitling themes that made me aware of the thread I was about to face (I'm talking about you Sephiroth). Every single song, theme or sound that plays is perfect. Now the most importante part... story and characters. Now this is the aspect that hit me the most hard. The story is extremely tied with the characters and the bonds they make troughout every single situation they are trapped in, and this leads to first, having some of the most charismatic and well written characters and second, having one of the most fascinating, emotional and intricate stories I've come across since I started playing videogames 20 years ago. Sadly I did not have the pleasure to playt the original one, but this made the experience with Remake and Rebirth even better cause everything is completely new for me. The last thing I wanna talk about is the secondary missions and miniogames. The game is perfectly balanced when it comes to plot and secondary missions and the way they are distributed in the playthrough. And everything is even better when you start noticing that a good ammount of the secondary missions are tied with the plot, revealing things about the characters, consecuences from the 1st game and expand everything right in front of your eyes. Also, minigames help you to not get bored of doing the same thing every singlke time as it happened to me while playing Elden Ring. I did not want Rebirth to end, even when I already had 100 hours in. Now the only issues I found were: Lighting, that was really weird on faces when there was too much direct sun on the faces of the characters, photo mode, that really **** but its not something I use too much and lastly, the traversal animations, that are kind of orthopedic and too fast, so it felt really unnatural. The game is still a 10/10 for me, and i wholeheartedly recommend it, it is a masterpiece.",10,2024-04-22,PLAYSTATION 5,user

The combat is so in depth with different builds, solo character playthrough. Only downside for me is too many mini games and the nigviation is kinda a mess in mid game. Ending may feel overwhelming at first, but it growth better if you willing to dig the rabbit hole and pay attention to the details. I gave it a 10 because there are many unfair reviews from other FF fans, likely those who hate ff7, turn base jrpg fans, shippers and og ff7 die heart fans can't accept the single twist of the story.",10,2024-04-21,PLAYSTATION 5,user

From the annoying yet fun mini-games to the action-packed storyline, it was such a great game to play through.

LuckyPennyBenny,"I'm really proud of what the square enix team was able to achieve with this game. It probably is one of the best FF games they have made in awhile and I have played a majority of them. This game involves amazing character driven narratives, fantastic fighting mechanics, true open world exploration, and new exciting content for old fans that can be really hard to do well in a remake of an old RPG game. It's unique and new but stays true to the OG PlayStation One FF7 we all know and love. From start to finish it is easy to get entangled into the massive world they created. All of the side quests and mini-games are so entertaining it makes you want to complete everything and platinum the game. There is so much to discover in the world map and you can tell how much meticulous detail is in everything that it is pretty amazing to explore. I remember wanting to take my time to do everything whereas in FF15 and FF16 it felt sort of tedious at times. The real strength of this game is how they really fleshed out the story and motives behind the characters so you feel more connected to them and more immersed into the FF7 story. Not only that, but also adding to the old story and bringing forth new exciting content fans haven't seen or were not expecting before.",10,2024-04-18,PLAYSTATION 5,user

The Good: Graphics and FX are superb, they really did a good job in detail and capturing the world of FF. I like that they left the option for classic battle vs the hack n slash of today games. The Bad: Too many mini games and useless quests, basically time fillers. Too many options for upgrading and leveling to the point of unnecessary confusion. Adding various timelines and such just makes a mess of any story (Honestly Chronotrigger was the only game that pulled it off, because they kept it simple), dont care much for the additional timeline stuff. I'll try to keeping going and update as I get closer to finishing the game.

seel82,"Long term gamer. It's among the best games I've played. As an old school FF fan, one who played the first one at release, I'm thankful this came out as I didn't think highly of 13 or 15, 16 wasn't much of an RPG, and 12 had severed flaws. It's been decades since the last good Final Fantasy. This was great right out of the gate, and right up until the end. There are some slight annoyances at times, but those are mostly related to going for platinum. The story is extremely good, the fighting is the best of any FF game, and all the other stuff like music etc is outstanding. The weakest area is probably the actual RPG element of it, but the rest of the game is strong enough to look over that (in the same way the fighting would be the worst of the Witcher games, but the rest of it was strong enough to not matter). It seems they've taken the best of what they've attempted with the last few games, and put it together. I hope they just slightly tweak the formula for the last one.

El juego tiene de todo y para todos, yo por lo menos no he notado ningún bug y eso que es un mapa enorme, y es sin duda el Final Fantasy definitivo que combina a la perfección sus puntos fuertes, creando una personalidad propia y arrollante que te hace no despegarte del mando. Una pena que el primer Remake fuera un pasillo, menuda ocasión malgastada para mostrarnos Midgar. Con FF VII Rebirth, han aprendido de sus errores pasados y nos han traído un juego que te devuelve a la niñez. ¿Qué es un poco infantil? El original también lo era, pero ahora la mayoría ya no tienen pelo y tienen una familia. Un juego debe ser para todos los públicos, y estoy seguro que la nueva juventud que pruebe este juego, estará sintiendo lo que sentimos todos cuando jugamos al original. Si a eso le sumamos que a los que ya tenemos una edad nos evoca de nuevo ese sentimiento, solo podemos decir que los creadores del juego han logrado lo que buscaban, y era un juego para gustar a todos, hayas jugado al original o no. Para mí, solo detrás del RDR2 en cuanto a los mejores juegos que haya jugado. Con ganas de la última parte, y quien sabe, de un futuro IX Remake.

And yet somehow Remake/Rebirth have recaptured the artistic excellence and expanded it into every corner of the game. I feel I know each of these imminently familiar characters even more so. My one caveat in all this is that I highly suggest playing with the Japanese audio. Stay away from the egregious English dub. I do not know what the problem was here but it’s somehow gotten even worse than from Remake.

zelaxi,"Writing this review is bittersweet for me, as I'm a die-hard fan of the Final Fantasy series. Final Fantasy VII on the original PlayStation was a pivotal game that shaped my gaming journey, introducing me to a genre I've never looked back from. Witnessing its Remake (and now its Rebirth as part 2 of 3) triggered a profound reaction in me, making it the remake I've longed for the most.That said, Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth has left me conflicted. While it boasts moments of soaring highs, it also descends into valleys of significant lows. I'll refrain from delving into the story, as its impact is highly subjective and I believe the game is worth experiencing for oneself. Is it perfect? No, but it continues to explore unique themes and twist tropes in refreshing ways that I hope will be further explored.Approaching this review after completing a blind run through the main game, my perspective might evolve if, and it's a big if, I manage to achieve 100% completion. However, at this point, I don't foresee the desire to grind out the **** combat feels refined from the remake, yet it still suffers from frustrating moments. The blend of action RPG with a turn-based system is starting to show its age, and while the stagger system may be the best version of it, it's evident that it's been utilized across multiple games. However, I appreciate the introduction of new character combos (synergy) that add flair and satisfaction, especially when finishing off enemies.Truthfully I might just not be good at this version of action RPG. Some battles proved exceedingly frustrating, surpassing the challenges of even the most daunting encounters in Souls-like games. There seems to be a lack of action cancelling or sufficient invincibility frames, though I can't pinpoint the exact issue. It's possible my age is catching up with me!The last open-world Final Fantasy, XV, received mixed reviews for its lackluster implementation. However, Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth manages to both shine and falter in its open-world design. The side quests are exceptional, building upon the success of meaningful story additions seen in previous titles. With over twenty side quests, each offering unique player interactions, the game avoids common MMO-trope requirements, providing a refreshing experience.Each area feels meticulously crafted, offering familiar yet fresh vistas. However, some areas are cumbersome to navigate due to the absence of a jump button or limited climbing options. Despite this, the variety of activities in each area, from relic hunting to unique monster slaying, ensures engagement without overwhelming the player.Character growth undergoes slight changes with the addition of ""folios"" for each character, although this doesn't significantly deviate from previous systems. Weapon leveling follows a flat scale, which, while forgettable for the most part, adds some depth to customization. Materia makes a return with minor tweaks, with the enemy skill materia standing out as particularly noteworthy as well as some new support materia combos that do aid the party in their battles.Overall, Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth is a solid game, though it falls short of securing a place among my most cherished gaming experiences in the series. However, it's possible that a more complete picture will emerge with the release of the entire arc of the remake. With the anticipated release of the third installment in 2027, despite my reservations with Rebirth, I eagerly await Resurrection... or Revival... or Regeneration. Yeah, my money's on Regeneration.",7,2024-04-14,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Reed618,"All in all it's an excellent game. It recaptures a lot of the magic from the original with excellent casting and a clear love for the source material. The combat is truly excellent and I had a fantastic time with it. I don't think it works overly well as a remake if i'm honest. It feels more like a theme park for people who grew up playing and loving the game. The story is now so padded out that I wonder if it's actually that interesting or even all that comprehensible anymore. It has some other flaws for too. It has some of the worst open world bloat I've seen in some time. Towers to be activated, quick time event minigames scattered around which add little and after a few chapters quite a lot of the side content was starting to feel repetitive. Also while they nailed almost every character... Cid is pretty different. I hope his character arc gets covered in the last game. Some side stuff like queens blood is excellent though. I really hope the developers stream line things for the final entry. All in all though it's a fantastic game, so far the 7 remake trilogy is the most interesting entry in Final Fantasy in many years.",9,2024-04-14,PLAYSTATION 5,user

I noticed a few comments complaining about filler and minigames but what they're referring to is the expanded and incredibly large environments that wow'd and amazed me and the minigames? I found myself frustrated with a couple but the overwhelming majority of minigames are optional. There were perhaps 2 minigames that are required to progress the story but I find it hard to believe that anyone could fail these seeing as how a toddler could beat them. I found all of them to be fun especially the newly included card game! usually, i find myself disinterested in in-game card games but this was too fun playing. This game ended up having so many wonderful characteristics of other games and its own unique and action packed jaw dropping battle and boss sequences I find it hard to believe anyone wouldn't enjoy this game but to each their own I suppose. Its more than nostalgia and more than a deep loyalty to this game franchise.

The thing is, in many ways, you cant skip many of it, because you would not get some items or storyparts that are important. That is not my kind of good open world questing. I would have felt it more, if it would be more linear like the first part. But, i know that this is complaining on a very high level. Play it now, thank me later.",9,2024-04-13,PLAYSTATION 5,user

There were many memorable moments with the main cast that made you connect with them much deeper than previously possible.

Out of any JRPG ive played, I can easily say the FF7 remakes take the cake in this regard. The variety of different spells, abilities and attacks you can choose at your liking are incredibly addicting to play around with. But the combat is a given for these games at this point. What you really want to experience with this game is all of the heart that is put into every single detail of the game. This manifests itself in the score, the story, the voice acting, the beautifully crafted open world environments, the minigames, the chocobos…..literally every part of this game has been fine tuned and polished to provide the best experience it can not just through the gameplay itself…. But through Final Fantasy’s remarkable talent of storytelling utilizing every aspect at its disposal.

Nsfj,"I really wanted to give this a perfect 10/10, but couldn't because of the never-ending poorly controlled mini games that you are forced to play over and over and over again, as well as the annoying combat sim challenges at the end of the game that you need for a platinum trophy They really take away from the game and too many hours are spend on them, resulting in the story feeling way too thin and stretched out. You will forget what the heck is going on in the plot and why characters are doing what they're doing because you spent the last hour playing an awful minigame that they locked an important item behind the high score. The amount of story in this game feels about the same as in Remake, but instead stretched across 100+ hours instead of 30 hours for Remake. 20% of the side quests are stupid and cringe and need to go and 90% of the mini games are horrible and need to be skippable and/or inconsequential, meaning that the rewards for them are only money or Gold Saucer points, not important items. The mini game controls are horrible and you will end up having to hit replay hundreds of times in order to get the necessary perfect scores. If I were to score the mini games as their own separate game, it would be close to a zero. They're that bad. Next are the 'Brutal' Combat challenges. Some of them are fine, but some are just unreasonable and are extremely annoying on purpose. This also brings down the game's overall score. When a challenge is no longer about skill, and instead about pre-reading a strategy guide to find the loopholes and mistakes in the combat system, it's a poorly made challenge. If you are looking to platinum trophy this game, then YOU WILL HAVE TO COMPLETE THESE CHALLENGES. When a developer makes a game annoying on purpose, rather than difficult, I have to take off points; it's an error in game design. I really wish I hadn't tried to complete this game. It has really tarnished my overall view of it. The developers do not respect you or your time if you are trying to platinum trophy this game. As a result I have lost a good deal of respect for the game. I didn't mind the confusing ending as much as everyone else did, since this is a part two of three. This seems to be intentionally vague and they will have to answer the important questions in the third game. I think of it like a season finale with a cliffhanger that you need to wait till the next season for resolution. If the next game has stupid answers to the questions raised at the end of this game, then this game will end up suffering a lot as a result, and my score will end up going down another point or more. For the good parts of the game, the characters, voice acting, music and main gameplay are perfect 10/10. FF7 Remake was great and they improved in all of these areas. The main story is great, although it feels a little bit spread too thin over too many hours and side quests and awful minigames. So I'd give the story a 9/10. Overall it averages out to a good game, but I have to say I'm so disappointed in the mini games and the platinum trophy frustration. I feel like they robbed this game of a perfect score. Honestly, if they patched them to make them either skippable or more playable, it would go a long way. But as it stands, they take this game from a 10 down to a 9. Also, Chadley and Mai are very annoying and their dialogue needs to be patched so you can just turn it off. I honestly think I enjoyed Remake more than Rebirth. The story for Remake had better pacing and less filler, the mini games were fewer and less annoying, and the challenges were more reasonable. Perhaps replaying the game in new game+, where you can skip the side quests and minigames will give a much better experience.",9,2024-04-11,PLAYSTATION 5,user

And I want to finish that silly game and uninstall it as soon as possible. Maybe I'll try some hard difficult fighting challenges but I don't know.

A really big upgrade of the Remake. This time it actually feels like a full game. The graphics and art style are amazingly beautiful and the soundtrack is godlike. I fell in love with each one of the main characters and even with some side ones. The gameplay is the same as Remake, but the new characters are really fun to play, Yuffie being my favorite to play with. Even though i didn't play the OG game, i loved the story. It was all perfect until that ending that really **** and just overcomplicated things for no reason. My main complaint of this game would be the open areas, they are fine and all but the side quest and minigames in there are very, very repetitive that a felt really bored after Juno. The open world of this game is pretty much just Ubisoft open-world and, i totally hate it. They were trying so hard to make this areas bigger that they forgot to actually make it fun. The Costa del Sol and Golden Saucer minigames are amazing though. Side quests are pretty much just go to point a, then to point B, fight some monster sin Point C, and your done.

Wie kann das, was hier passiert irgendwen noch Spaß machen? Ich habe mich bis zu diesem Punkt gequält, weil ich bisher jedes FF durchgespielt habe. Aber ich ertrage diese plumpe und kindische Inszenierung einfach nicht mehr. Ich komme mir so vor, als würde ich mir einen Barbie Animationsfilm anschauen. Square hat es geschafft, dass ich keinen einzigen Charakter mehr leiden kann. Alle nerven mich nur noch und die Story lässt mich völlig kalt. Hinzu kommen belanglose und unkreative Spielmechaniken und Mini Games die einen in den Wahnsinn treiben. Mir ist es wirklich ein Rätsel, wie dieses Gameplay-Wrack so eine gute Wertung bekommen konnte. Da hat wohl jemand sehr viel Geld hingeblättert.

bsniz,"After picking up a PS5, I barreled through FF7 Remake before starting the new FF 7 Rebirth. I wish I had gone straight to Rebirth, because it is LIGHTYEARS ahead of FF7 Remake. Remake followed a similar path to the original in that it was mostly a linear progression with a few stops for side quests. It was FINE, but at some points, it felt like I was slogging through. The quests weren't interesting, the battle system was good but not great, the graphics were the same - good but not great. Rebirth is INCREDIBLE. The open-world design is right up there with Tears of the Kingdom. The battle system feels like a cross between Final Fantasy, Zelda, and Street Fighter. The graphics are some of the best I've ever seen in a video game. I'm only through two of the seven open-world regions, and I'm like 22 hours in. This game is bonkers big. And the side quests don't feel like bloat. There are so many different mechanics for crafting and building and leveling that it feels DEEP. The story is very engaging as well, but it's easy to get distracted with all the super fun side quests.

JYLN2004,"Absolutely incredible. I am so glad I played Final Fantasy 7 Remake years ago. It was my first Final Fantasy experience ever. I always heard from family and friends about how great the series was and I always thought it was just some super anime fantasy game that looked depressing to me and never expected it to be what it was when I finally played FF7 remake. Given how much I loved Remake, I had high expectations for Rebirth but Square Enix absolutely blew my expectations out of the water completely. I was not expecting this game to be absolutely jam packed with so much detail and content to engage in. I spent over 100 hours playing this game and spent so much time just doing side quests which is something I NEVER do in a single player game. I usually will do some side content stuff but after a while I stick to main story and completely ignore side quests because they are usually boring, but in Rebirth, the side content is just as amazing and enjoyable as the main story.Mini games galore! So many mini games that are so well thought out and fun to play. Queensblood had me addicted. Any time I entered a new region, I was looking for Queensblood. I was like a drug addict looking for some QB constantly. I couldn't get enough of it and who ever came up with this mini game is an absolute genius. Aside from the side content being amazing, the main story blew me away with each chapter. It was like the TV show Breaking Bad, it got better and better and better and never seemed to dwindle down like most big story games tend to do. I will say though that one criticism of the story I have is the multi verse concept they are introducing here. Multi verse stories usually don't end well and tend to collapse on itself once it starts to unfold and the ending was a bit confusing with Aerith dying and coming back multiple times, I felt it took away from the emotion of her death because you weren't actually sure what was happening. But I will say so far, the multi verse concept they are introducing isn't bad and I think they've handled it somewhat clearly so far but we'll have to wait for part 3 to know for **** gameplay is just on another level in this game. The combat has been enhanced in almost every way from Remake and the introduction of Synergy attacks and being able to pick your team you go into battle with is just genius. The visuals are mindblowing. The set pieces, the different regions and areas are SO INCREDIBLY MASSIVE and so beautiful that it just takes your breath away sometimes. I loved all of the dark cave areas. Add on great performance with both the 30 and 60 fps options. Truly amazing how they are able to do this with such a Titan ****. The music is just the cherry on top. The music gives you goosebumps and makes the game 10 times better. The music in this game is so unique and different from anything else I've ever heard from a video game or really any other form of entertainment.I recommend this game to anyone who wants an amazing story loaded with side content and incredible graphics.38 people found this h",10,2024-03-19,PLAYSTATION 5,user

dominostars,"TL;DR: Objectively this game is a major accomplishment, but there are too many small story and gameplay frustrations that added up to make it an overall unenjoyable experience for me. The good: huge open world and city designs are a great re-imagining from the original. Main character interactions are great, reprisals of the original soundtrack are great, some mini games are good, the battle system is (mostly) fun, and materia is really fun (both to find and be creative with) The bad: The open world exploration really disrespects your time with slow interactions and a million interruptions from Chadley that you can't easily skip through, making it a pretty frustrating gaming experience. Additionally, most of what there is to do in the open world is pretty uninspired, and there's no real sense of discovery because everything is shown on the map for you. Separately, the game saddles the main quest with tons of mini games, many of which are a drag. Finally, other than chapter 13, the game really failed to deliver on big emotional moments, by ruining the tone and/or making things too convoluted. Because of this, and because the game added way too many obnoxious characters (MAI, Kyrie, Beck's Baddasses, Roche, Johnny, even sometimes Yuffie, etc. etc.), it made it hard to take the game seriously at all. The ugly: MAI talking over you during hunts is one of the worst, most annoying gaming experiences I've ever suffered through. Boss battles frequently interrupt the flow of battle to show cut scenes you can't skip and often end up ruining stagger build up. Some music tracks were so bad I had to mute, something I don't recall ever having to do ever in my life playing games.

TheGamerGuide,"Massively engaging from its first moment to its epic last scene, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is unlike any other remake out there. Not just grand in scale and scope, this is also a deep and involving RPG that's less a chapter in a wider saga, more a sprawling adventure that stands on its own. A fantastic, bravura piece of work. TGG – 9 / 10 AUDIO 9/10 The reworked arrangements of memorable tunes are wonderful, while the voice acting is superb. Something for the nostalgic and newcomer alike. Splendid stuff.

Given its immense scale, Rebirth is an astonishingly attractive game. PLAYABILITY 9/10 Did you enjoy FF VII Remake? Then you'll be equally enamoured with Rebirth, which builds upon the combat mechanics of the previous game, while offering a plethora of new things to explore. And it's all brilliant. DELIVERY 9/10 If you're mainlining the story then you're looking at a solid 30-40 hours. Factor in all of the side quests and various secrets to discover, and you're getting closer to 60-80 hours.",9,2024-04-07,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Luifilth,"Jogo excelente, muito divertido e gostoso de jogar, amei a dedicação e o apreço pelos detalhes. Seria maravilhoso se não tivessem cagado na história. Joguei o antigo quando saiu e pra mim a história era excelente sem tirar nem por. Mas ""alguém"" tem que inventar algo tosco para poder cagar no jogo. Infelizmente queria dar a melhor nota e eu daria, antes de ver o final, gostaria de dizer que mereceria ser goty, mas pra mim não merece. Colocar o zack daquela forma tosca no jogo sem explicação, pra inventar mundos paralelos foi ridículo. Eu como jogador antigo ainda estou perdido e não entendi nada do que quiseram fazer com aquela merda. Pra mim o cara que inventou isso nao passa de um idiota, pois como disse a história já era boa. Se essa ideia partiu do criador, antes ele não era um idiota, mas se tornou agora, se saiu da cabeça de algum merda executivo, esse não passa de um escroto que com certeza não sabe nada sobre o jogo. É dolorido se manter dentro da história, precisam mudar pq a nova geração é burra e não vai entender o que se passou na história original. O jogo vai bem até o templo dos antigos, em alguns capitulos houve mudanças na história de forma tosca, mas foram até aceitáveis. Já a morte da aerith foi um lixo total, aliás o final do jogo foi toda uma merda uma atrás da outra. Outra coisa a essência desse jogo são as músicas e as principais foram modificadas de uma forma tosca, que na minha opinião ficaram ruins, como exemplo, cito a de gold saucer antes de irem para o templo quando cloud sai para fazer um tour no parque com um personagem, aquela musica é extremamente clássica, deveria ser mantida como era. Mas, mais uma vez querem inventar para os novos fãs. Os antigos que se danem, já que pagaram no começo, o gosto deles não interessa. Enfim, uma coisa tenho que aplaudir, não houve lacração, por isso agradeço a square e a todos os desenvolvedores.",7,2024-04-07,PLAYSTATION 5,user
partyboy69,"Prior to CH14 the game was an easy 10 for me! The single best thing I've played since picking up my first controller 28 years ago. I'm still not fully in love with some of the direction choices made for chapter 14, but I won't go into the what and why as I think everyone should play this game and figure out the ending for themselves...which is something I went away and did, and it turned it from just Ok, to great for me. I don't know how I'm going to manage this anticipation for part 3 for another 3-4 years. Score: 9.5 - Gave it a 10 because of review bombers.

Givos,"I'm like halfway through this game, but it feels hard to play on. The main reason for me is that there are so many clowns in this game. I don't mind if there are some jokes here and there, but this game absolutely doesn't find the balance between over the top slapstick and serious story for me (like Yakuza did for example). And don't get me stared on Yuffi. The open world feels Ubisoft like, with towers and stuff. And then there is Chadley and his sister that annoyingly have to comment on any side quest you do, even if you just had to press triangle for three times. Also the amount of mini games is absolutely over the top. It feels like you want to play Final Fantasy and then you are forced to play Fifa then Forza and then Mario Party. And I can't stop thinking: ""What am I doing here?"" Production value, graphics and Music is great, but that doesn't make a game great. The feeling of the game is what's make me want to play it and that's really cringe in this one. Edit: I've completed it now. I never had a game that made me this angry. To the end the boss fights are getting ridiculous. The designers seem to have thought: ""the more and the bigger the better"". But it's just not fun anymore. It just feels empty and stupid.

FF7 Rebirth ist viel zu überladen mit Minigames und unbalanced was einem den Spielspaß durchaus vermiesen kann, das Kampfsystem basiert gerade auf dem höchsten Schwierigkeitsgrad zu einem guten Teil auf Glück und die Checkpoints sind auch fraglich gewählt worden wie ich finde. Story und Inzinierung sind dagegen Top ebenso wie ein Großteil der OpenWorld Aktivitäten! Hätte mir persönlich halt ein fokusierteres FF Erlebnis gewünscht wie bei FF16.

I didn't have to do it all, but I wanted to, I haven't had so much fun in a open world with side quests since The Witcher 3, I can clearly see the influence in the side content and missions, it all works incredibly well. Finally Tifa, just Tifa... The wait for part 3 will be long but if they keep this level of quality, it will be worth it.

Haannss,"This game starts looking like all I wanted: the story, the music, the visual part... and they ruined it with minigames and a combat style without any sense. At this point, it feels crystal clear that the greedy decision of splitting the original game into 3 parts was a **** choice. Not only makes each part artificially long with senseless add-ons, but also has disgusted players and, as it seems for the sales, it won't pay out. The only comfort I get is knowing that next time they might think twice, but this one was one of the games of my life and they've already ruined it. The enemy's attack will always break your own attack. Especially when fighting against more than one enemy. Why? Well, just because. You lose both the action bar and the action itself, because developers haven't thought on a gameplay more respectful with the original. Most of the times, you die while healing yourself. It's a complete nonsense, what a waste of game. Some enemies have stupid mechanics, like ""cover all your attacks"" where you need to slowly build up their vulnerability bar through repetitive moves once and again for too much time, resulting on boring battles. And then you have the mini games. Luckily I got to play a little bit of FF VII between one minigame and another. Waaay too many and waaay too unnecessary. One would argue that the original game had minigames as well. But this is not what the original FF VII was about. Minigames were scattered here and there, but in the Rebirth is the story that is scattered. ""You don't need to do them if you don't want to"". Yeah, ok, but I've loved FF VII since I was a kid and I obviously want to have this one 100% complete. And many people just like me. The developers knew that and have played with it. Sad truth is -this is not the game we loved.",2,2024-04-06,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Ok, I’m not super fan of the new combat system (I am still sticked to the turned based), ok, there are some additions they could have skip (story additions I mean), and yes there are some things different feom the original but… it’s still FFVII!

SpookyAhh,"As an ardent fan of Final Fantasy, particularly FF7, I eagerly delved into Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth with a mix of excitement and caution. Having thoroughly enjoyed the Remake, my expectations were high for this latest installment. However, what I found on this journey was a rollercoaster of emotions, filled with moments of thrill and frustration. Let's address the issue of repetitiveness in the game's environments. While each location has its own unique look and feel, the tasks within them can feel disappointingly similar. It seems like a copy-and-paste approach was used to artificially extend the game's length, which unfortunately takes away from the overall immersion. Encountering yet another set of repetitive objectives can be disheartening, hindering the potential for genuine exploration and excitement.Furthermore, the abundance of minigames, while charming at first, can become overwhelming at certain points in the game. The sudden influx of these distractions feels more like an attempt to fill content rather than a natural addition to the gameplay. While some players may enjoy these diversions, others, like myself, may feel pulled away from the main story. On a brighter note, the combat system continues to shine amidst the game's flaws. Engaging in battles is a thrilling experience, with each fight offering a mix of strategy and spectacle. The introduction of character-specific play styles adds a dynamic element to the combat, allowing players to experiment with different tactics. While not every character resonated with me, I could still appreciate the effort put into diversifying their abilities and fighting techniques. Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is truly a testament to the franchise's legacy, showcasing both its strengths and weaknesses.",5,2024-04-05,PLAYSTATION 5,user
nerogelion,"I hesitate to call a game 'perfect', but Rebirth is ridiculously close. Small changes to the already amazing combat turn it into a sublime affair, with stellar graphics and an absurdly great cast rounding out the experience. While the game feels overstuffed at times, and the level design still retains some of the sloggy feeling of Remake, It manages to improve on the first entry in almost every meaningful way, except in fields like the soundtrack, which was already a 10/10 aspect. The story is largely faithful to the original, but manages to subvert expectations in a way that keeps it fresh and exciting, and brings a new level of surprise to one of the most-spoiled events in any video game to date.",9,2024-04-05,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Las secundarias no son nada del otro mundo pero cierra la historia de ciertos personajes del remake. La música es dios. La dificultad es muy buena en proporcional.

pyhriel,"The game is very average and quickly becomes dull and repetitve. It has its moment and a few the core gameplay is fine (although very underused) but most of the game is just a mash up of minigames and soulless sidequests.I could appreciate some of the better minigames if the games wasn't littered with them, and if most of them weren't just time-wasters (aka things that just take time but offers no entertainment and no real challenge). Many of the more challenging bits are made so by using s variation of a timer, where if you fail to finish fast enough you die/fail, which I do not find compelling. The worst offender though is the storyline. it is very overcomplicated for no real benefits and it is more of an amalgamation of scenes that are meant to be cool, than an actual story.

Akc018,"I beat the game, but just because it’s a final fantasy and especially ff7. Otherwise there are several points in the game I would have ****’s a fine game but I just can’t find myself liking it to the level I hoped. The good: - stunning environment and world building - very great models for the main characters - follows the OG ff7 which is an established one of the all time great - music of course should be praised like all other final fantasy game. The bad: - It’s boring, especially the open world part. The first 7~8 chapters have very few things going on. - I didn’t like the combat. While a lot of people praised its combat system, it doesn’t work out for me. It’s not intuitive, and the game doesn’t even try to introduce it. Block and dodge doesn’t work as naturally as real action games. It sure seems to have a of complexity and customization, it just doesn’t feel fun and rewarding. I did the entire play through on Normal, it can be frustrating at times. Like RPG, leveling would help, but the boring and dragging open world makes it a pretty bad experience. - Excessive mini games. While some mini games can be ok and fun, there’re just too much, and some of them are even required in main quests. Card games and piano are the better ones, but there are also very bad mini-games like wrangling chocobos and luring the chicken back to the village (this one is just ridiculous) - The story is just not that fun. To a larger part, the story here is a story told twenty years ago, so it’s difficult to get surprise and delight. Chopping it to a trilogy doesn’t help at all. And because of that, the game tries to make it even more obscure with the parallel world thing. The entire story feels loose and confusing and not addicting. If I didn’t know about OG FF7, the story probably doesn’t make sense as a whole - Pacing is very bad, this contributes significantly to the boring feeling. So much stuff is designed to waste your time, like mini-games, the forced very slow walk through out all chapters, the slow animations and climbing, and branched story with different party members (the worst being the personal trials in chapter 13, when it pops out I was like “why SE? Why?”). I spent about 60 hours to finish my first play through. It probably would feel a lot better if it’s 30 hours. - The characters are too anime-ish, a lot of times they are cringy and unnatural. The character development is hit and miss. Outside of the main cast it’s worse. Btw, when there’re a lot of people like costa de sol, it feels more like Sims than a final fantasy game.

costadelmoll,"Having finished the game two weeks ago, I am still having withdrawal symptoms. Rebirth was absolutely incredible, I don't even know where to begin. I recall being 60 hours into the game and realising that I had played so much, but that so much still lay ahead of me. It was wild how much there was to do in this game and yet it didn't feel like a slog. The interplay between the main story and the side content was well structured such that it kept me so engaged. The side content was so rewarding to complete, not only for the rewards, but also how it fleshed out so much of the lore and the world. As a die hard FF7 fan, the game had so many references to the other FF7 titles that made me so happy. The amount of love and attention that the developers gave to this game cannot be stressed enough. The game play and the minigames were so engaging, something that I felt also defined the original game. I really like how they adapted the original story into this new re-imagining. Major story changes aside, I really like the subtle tweaks that they made, which made some of the original plot points make more sense than how they were portrayed in the original. I would just be repeating the plethora of other reviews here by stating that the battle system and music were so well crafted and banging. My criticisms of the game would be that the ending sections may have crammed a lot of plot and information into it. The final sections do indeed garner a lot of ""controversy"", however the longer I ponder on what I played, the more intrigue it generates in me that I cannot wait for part 3 to see the resolution of this story. I'm by no means a professional critic, however my appreciation for what the game developers delivered has really inspired me to leave my first ever review. I do believe that this game is a masterpiece that is legitimately fun and engaging, tells a great story and really respects the foundation that it is based on. I still cannot believe that the day has come that we were able to witness the world of FF7 in beautiful 4K. I am still in awe at what I just played. Pinch me.",10,2024-04-02,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Nonathletigamer,"There are sections that are fittingly remade or even expanded on or improved. There are others which are changed for the worse. There is a ton to do, but it is so much that the story often gets diluted in the process. I found myself trying to remember why certain things were happening, and was answering that by remembering the original game in my head. I can't imagine it makes any kind of sense for someone who hasn't played the original. It does not stand on its own. But many characters are given better characterization, so it's conflicting. The combat is probably the best thing about it, even though I would still rather it be turn based. The unfair, punishing, and sadistic difficulty come in the unending stream of minigames. While not every iteration of every game is essential to move through the main story, lots of helpful armor/materia/etc are locked behind them, so they might as well be. My emotions were jerked around and I could never put it down for my own sanity because I am invested in the story since age 10. For as hard as the hundreds of people worked on this huge game, by the end I do not feel valued as a fan, or a player. The game punishes you for playing it, and for not having god-like reflexes. It is the least accessible JRPG in history. The people who made this game do not care if disabled people can enjoy it. If you care about who Cloud romances, you HAVE to look up online guides to do the right things (which means you'll spoil yourself, one way or another, because a playthrough without some sort of guide help is basically impossible) because the dialogue options with romantic stakes don't give you enough time to respond, you can't pause during them, and the game chooses for you if you don't pick in time. There are two characters that should not be a romance option for Cloud (creepy age gap), but they are, so I had to start neglecting them by leaving them out of my party, ignoring their sidequests, ignoring them if the option came to speak with them, and being rude to them if I was forced to talk to them. For as much as the characters themselves are improved (except Sephiroth, who is as lame as he was in Remake, but he at least doesn't show up every 5 minutes), at the end I felt empty, defeated, and deflated. I wondered why I spent nearly 300 hours on this game, why I couldn't stop playing the ""optional"" parts I hated, why the devs decided to say ""**** accessibility"" in a genre historically much friendlier to non-athletic players, and why it seemed to ruin the most important story moments with all the timeline/multiverse/whisper/artiber of fate nonsense. I feel cheated, but I also feel like an addict. I couldn't say no to preordering this game even though I didn't really like the last one, and I will be preordering the next one. This has to the worst case I've experienced of being forced to take a ride that doesn't edify me or give me pleasure, but I am hooked on it because of nostalgia.",4,2024-04-01,PLAYSTATION 5,user
Jodrix15,Un sueño hecho realidad. Un regalo para los fans. Un juego superdivertido de jugar con muchos minijuegos a los que puedes acudir cuando quieras para desconectar de la trama o de las misiones secundarias.

JackTLP,"Could have been a lot better. For the most part the game is good and enjoyable, definitely worth playing but it does nothing to live up to the original FF7's story. Far too many plot holes, and the ending... Terrible. Gameplay wise, too much focus on annoying minigames, granted some are very good like Queen's Blood. Graphics/Performance are also poor but not a deal breaker. Worth playing but very disappointing story wise.",5,2024-04-01,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Mibu_No_Okami,"Dopo oltre 20 anni Final Fantasy è tornato in grande spolvero. Era dai tempi del decimo capitolo di questo rinomato brand che non mi divertivo e rimanevo estasiato con tale veemenza. L'esplorazione del mondo di gioco non è mai stata così bella e gratificante, con aree tutte ben caratterizzate e diversificate. Il combat system è lo stesso del suo predecessore, ma qui è stato ulteriormente perfezionato. Con ogni probabilità è ad oggi indiscutibilmente il combat definitivo per il genere di riferimento. Il mondo di Gaia trasuda magia da tutti i pori e il lavoro di ""trasposizione"" e adattamento della world map dell'originale del 1997 è sbalorditivo. Così come è meraviglioso l'approfondimento di eventi e characters, questi ultimi mai stati così ""veri"" e belli. Tornano finalmente anche i minigiochi, una mole incalcolabile di minigames da far uscire matto qualsivoglia giocatore, con accezione positiva. La soundtrack è fuori scala con un mix di tracce memorabili del passato qui arrangiante divinamente e nuovi pezzi stupendi tutti da scoprire. Graficamente parlando Rebirth segue le orme del primo capitolo ma considerando l'ampio respiro del prosieguo dell'avventura, si può dire che sono stati fatti persino passi in avanti in tal senso. La direzione artistica risulta infatti splendida. Innumerevoli e incredibilmente emozionanti infine alcuni momenti di trama riproposti qui in modo superlativo e che mi hanno ricordato il perché Final Fantasy VII è un capolavoro e uno dei titoli più importanti del medium videoludico. Un must assoluto per tutti gli appassionati dei JRPG e dei videogiochi in senso lato.",10,2024-03-31,PLAYSTATION 5,user

KamikazeAttacks,"I had to make an account just to put out how absoloutely disappointed i was with this game. First up is just how horrendous the mini games are. I mean how do you have that many thrown in to a game and not manage to make a single one that either plays well or is fun? Secondly the world map is completely devoid of anything. Oh wow i can go activate some towers and beat a different colored variant of an enemy that is just barely stronger. Thirdly and most importantly how do you turn such a great story that the original had and turn it in to this nonsensical trash? By the end of the game I was just glad it was done. This is what happens when you try and smash two great things together that aren't supposed to combine, you end up with this. On the positives it's nice how they fleshed out characters with more back story, It makes you care for them even more. The game looks beautiful, and the soundtrack is amazing. The combat for me is just whatever, I didn't hate it I didn't love it. Having played the first part i knew it wouldn't differentiate much from that. Overall after almost 100 hours I'm just disappointed, and I'd certainly never play through it again. Oh and the chain of end bosses felt ridiculous and drawn out. If I could go back to before I had played I'd just start a new save on the original instead.",6,2024-03-31,PLAYSTATION 5,user
StephenHyer,First 70 hours were polished and fantastic. The last 40 or so have been infuriating. Horribly unbalanced fights. Everything can one shot either individual or entire party. Mini-game difficulty spikes are mostly just RNG. For completionists the late game is enough to make you want to uninstall after 100 hours. It’s that bad.

akacrazzy,"FF7 Rebirth is an incredible game with it's best features being the story, characters, JRPG elements, and combat. While the open world is vast and has plenty of variety region to region, the hundreds (and I mean hundreds) of open world activities get super repetitive super fast. By the 3rd region of the game I was already sick of it, it is literally just bloat added to the game. Also, the performance/optimization of the game is straight up bad. Graphics mode is fine, but in performance mode it looks like vaseline is smeared across my monitor, even after the patch. Because of this and the before mentioned open world bloat, the game drops a few points for me. All in all, it is a great game and incredibly enjoyable for people returning to the world of final fantasy so many years later, or for those who are experiencing it for the first time like myself.",8,2024-03-31,PLAYSTATION 5,user
akadoura,"Incredible game. It really fulfills the promise of stepping out Midgar and into “terrifying freedom” all those years ago. Now, it is possible sometimes to lose the thread, so to speak, story and pacing-wise—with the abundance of so many open-world activities. And despite being someone who is a **** for a good open-world game when done right, I still wish there was a little more done to at least create the illusion of more varied discoveries and exploration. There is a huge amount of variety in activities, but since they’re copy-pasted across the world, once you’ve seen one of each type you kind of lose that feeling of the unknown that’s so rewarding in world exploration. Elden Ring is one of my all-time favorite open-world games and it also repeats a lot of activity templates, but they somehow change them up just enough to often feel unique (though not always, but it just feels a bit better disguised there). That’s my only real complaint about the game and why I give it a 9 but it’s still, without a doubt, an amazing, must-play RPG. Update: After replaying it and doing all end-game challenges, I’ve decided to give it a full 10/10. Despite these issues I had with the open-world quest design in places, the game somehow still managed to make most stuff feel exciting all the way til the end, and the game is just so damn good overall. I still wish it had more varied and more surprising/mysterious exploration, but the stuff it does well just really outweighed that stuff for me in the end.",10,2024-03-31,PLAYSTATION 5,user

rtazen,"First, I know know people love this game. That is perfectly fine. My hope is games like this do not become the trend. First, I will write about the stuff I like. Then the stuff that is mid or ok. I will end on my concerns with this game. Pros: Graphics are pretty amazing. It is a beautiful game. The monster designs are pretty impressive. The landscapes are varied and beautiful. The sound in impressive. Voice acting was pretty solid overall. Battle effects were solid. Mid - The gameplay is not the epic step up from turn-based combat that it claims to be. It is awkward at best. I know there are many that like this type of game play, but unfortunately, I am not among them. One of the things about RPG games of old is the strategy elements of turn based combat. It was solid. It fit well with the genre. The gameplay is fine, but pretty awkward at times. The Bad - For me, it is simple. This game does not respect the player's time. It starts pretty well at Kalm. Then you get released into the grasslands and holy **** does it go off the rails. You are greeted with a Far Cry style of tower climbing. You have to listen to Chadley give directions on what to do next. This nonsense went on for hours. Then, you can move on to the next section and story beat. That can easily take 6-8 hours if you are a OCD about all quests being done. Now, I am not saying that any of this is bad content. It is not bad. Queen's Blood is fun as hell. What I am saying is that for 8 hours, you are not progressing the **** story at all. You are doing busy work for people in the region. You are collecting trinkets for people in the region. You are hitting up nodes to make the battle to get a materia a lot easier. I made my way to the next section of the game and expected to see at least some significant story beats for as long as I had been playing the game. But **** much really happens. I kept all of this up until I got to Junon. After a quick story beat, back to the side quests you go. This padding is **** nuts. It does not do the world building that people claim. It only adds a great many hours to the run time. Most of it is pretty much garbage filler. The rest, is just kinda silly? Developers are not doing themselves favors by padding the hell out of a 40-50 hour game to make 3 or maybe even 4 full titles.

phantomyre,"Rebirth is a love-letter to both new and old fans of ff7. The development team went above and beyond in order to bring the fans something that is very fun, engaging, and mind-blowing. Even with the bit of fan-service which I'm very grateful for, you can tell the devs are well aware of their fans and what they desire. Even addressing characters like Cid and Vincent who were introduced late, they still were given time to shine as was appropriate for the game. The moments I enjoyed the most were the parts where I didn't know what would happen next. The new elements fascinated me and I wanted to know more. Even the newer characters introduced from a certain mobile game were a great addition, and I can only hope Square doesn't shy away from bringing new elements into the story. I enjoyed not knowing what would happen, discovering new characters, stories, and new plots mixed with familiar elements was well done. I personally would have wanted more new elements. The Gi lore was by far my favorite alteration. There were some elements to the game that didn't work well, however. For example, Shinra Manor was heavily dumbed down in terms of the horror vibes. Would have loved to explore it further, but was also just disappointed that it was no longer scary. Even the basement just felt underwhelming. One other area was that sometimes tonal shift was jarring as in the case of the Dyne scene. I would have liked more time to settle in emotion instead of having an immediate comedic scene right after a sad one. There are more mysteries being tied to certain characters which seem to imply a change in lore which I'm excited for. Being that the rating for FF7 has been T, however, I do worry about some characters and stories being tamed in part 3, thus lessening the impact. My hope is that Square doesn't shy away from going bold, so long as it is still within their vision, regardless of fan-feedback. With regards to the ending, which I will not spoil, it didn't have nearly the emotional impact for me as I already knew what would happen. It proved to me that a 1:1 remake would never have appealed to me, and the ending left me feeling a bit empty in that it wasn't as impactful-- simply because it was expected. Yes, there are elements of mystery, but the initial feeling is lacking. It does have me concerned about part 3 and if it will all end up just ending the same way the OG did. In conclusion, Rebirth is a beautiful experience that will appeal to both old and new fans, both for those who wanted an actual remake and for those who wanted something new. The reimagining has been carefully thought out, and there is so much love in this game. I am left in awe, but also hoping for further delving into the mysteries that await. The devs have managed to balance integrating both familiar and new aspects, but I can only hope part 3 will introduce new shocking and emotional mysteries that will allow fans to continue discussing ff7 even after part 3 is out. Of course, you can't please everyone, and Rebirth gives a few nuanced reminders of this to the players, for example a character says 'Expectations often lead to disappointment'. I believe this is the devs telling us to be prepared for change, but to also keep an open mind for what they have planned. Rebirth was way more faithful to OG than Remake by a long shot, even if there were still some new attributes. But what we are told is to temper our expectations of part 3. So take that for what it's worth. As a closing thought, Rebirth went over and beyond my expectations; I worry how the devs are going to top this game for part 3. I don't see how they can, but they've surprised me before. I now wait with baited breath for the final story of the trilogy and the fate that awaits our beloved characters.",9,2024-03-30,PLAYSTATION 5,user

The game also has a good replayability, since you can play hard mode and extreme challenges after you finish it (they are really no joke, super hard!) or you can see new dialogs and scene you didn't see in the first playthrough. Hard and long to get platinum; I needed 190 hours.",10,2024-03-27,PLAYSTATION 5,user
AntonioDS94,"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth è un gioco straordinario piuttosto open world, ha tante varie attività che altri open world risultano ripetitivi, questo gioco non annoia mai nonostante varie criticità, ho trovato legnoso qualche minigioco ma maggiormente sono una goduria.Questo prodotto presenta ambientazioni tra l'antico e il moderno con grande stile a me piace la direzione artistica del gioco. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth vanta di una colonna sonora più bella sentita nei videogiochi. Ritengo che sia il mio gioco preferito.

hylian_jpg,"This review will have minor spoilers, nothing crazy like how the game ends or main story beats passed the first open area… Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is one of the most complete games I’ve ever played in my life… Ironic despite it being Part 2 of 3.. After the breakneck pacing of the first two hours of the game, which gives the players some more insight into Cloud’s backstory.. The harrowing events of the titular Nibelheim Incident is such an amazing way to open the game up, giving us a small taste of this game’s evolved combat from Remake. You’re thrusted into the first of many, expansive open areas of the game… I remember getting lost before even getting my first Chocobo! Almost every side quest took a decent amount of time to complete, but also didn’t make me feel like I was doing someone’s chores.. Each quest elaborately adds to the ever-expanding world that these developers put so much time into creating... This is a game where you can spend HOURS doing side content, without progressing an ounce in the main story, and still feel like you’re not progressing, because there is SO much to do... Even if you feel you didn’t progress, I promise that the next time you speak to Chadley, he’ll have a new Combat Trial for you to complete which will reward you with some sweet, sweet, Materia that you couldn’t have gotten otherwise... Supplementing the rapid progression of doing main story missions that take a decent amount of time of time in and of themselves with the optional, yet expansive side missions was brilliant game design. Giving the player the agency to progress the story at their pace. Letting the player exhaust a certain open area, letting them choose when to progress. Also, it’s reminiscent of Breath of The Wild, but that doesn’t need to be said, everyone kind of already knows that. It’s slightly more restricting because at the end of the day, this is 10x more of a linear game than compared to BOTW. Last point I’ll touch on when talking about BOTW, but I haven’t been this surprised and impressed by a video game SINCE Breath of the Wild, as I did while playing this game. Every 30 minutes, while doing main story, or some side story, I was stunned by the amount of effort, care, finesse, and overall quality was put into this game’s creation. Nomura’s creative direction, story, and aesthetics aside, this game is special. It’s the craziest thing to squeeze dry a open area, do a main story mission, just to walk into an open area that was as big or bigger than the last one explored. I thought this game was never going to end. From the desolate open areas of Corel, to the pageantry that went into creating the Golden Saucer, all so amazing to see.I mentioned Materia earlier. About that, as you go further and further in the game, Materia becomes more and more granular... Elemental Materia, Magnify Materia, Enemy Skill! So much to talk about with each, but all so impressive and fun to use in your own way, any way you see fit... Some of this isn’t all new, as a lot of it is carried over from Remake, which laid down the framework for this game’s combat. Real time action, mixed with turn based is something that sounds like it won’t work, but when it does, its like poetry in motion from a game design standpoint. Mixed with each character’s unique loadout to deal damage, protect oneself, and counter effectively, again, when done right, it really is poetry in motion. What works for some boss, won’t work for the next. Or maybe it will! I feel like a third of the time I put into my playthrough was optimizing my Materia loadout, which doesn’t sound like fun, but it weirdly is…Overall, at the end of the day. I absolutely CANNOT wait for Part 3 to come out… I never grew up with Final Fantasy in general. The first one I played was OG FF7 in 2015-2016, some time around when Cloud was announced as a guest fighter in Super Smash Bros. Since then, it was abundantly clear the amount of effort, care, and love went into this single universe within this seemingly eternal game franchise which is Final **** terms of things I didn’t like, is that my only minor gripe, is that some of the minigames took a little longer to grasp, especially some of the ones that were mandatory in progressing the story from a gameplay standpoint. Also, if you want to count how Performance Mode looks not very good, it forced me into playing in Graphics Mode, which in the end, I enjoyed because of how cutscene heavy this game is. Part of it felt like I was playing a movie. Those are my only gripes. And with all of that being said.Whether you're new to Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy VII, the Remake trilogy, or gaming in general. This game provides one of the most complete packages in gaming that I've ever seen, so much so, that I can recommend this game to ANYONE.I give Final Fantasy VII Rebirth a 9.7/10.",9,2024-03-27,PLAYSTATION 5,user

FlexosuarousRex,"I am a huge lifelong ff7 fan, and was super hype to play this game. The combat has been improved and I love the story cutscenes, but there's actually a lot I don't really like about the game. I absolutely adored remake, but rebirth is filled with so many things I don't like. I have become very sour on open world games, and I feel that rebirth was just made into an open world experience because it was expected to be so. In reality, the overworld map was a very small portion of the original ps1 game that was only used to get from place to place and to find the occasional secret, it was not meant to be the main focus of the game but as a means by which the player finds the next chapter of the story. But in rebirth, the majority of content of the game, excluding minigames and cutscenes, is redundant open world busy work meant to do nothing more but to extend the playtime of the player and artificially increase the value of traversal - but all it serves to do is burn the player out even quicker than they would have been otherwise. The world map activities, well, it has basically become a ubisoft game and that's no exaggeration - trust me. I was excited for this game and for the continuation of the story and to be with my favorite characters in all of gaming once again, but I completely burned out by the time I got to the second area. As much as I hate it, I'm just not having fun with this title. Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought that I would have shelved this game as quickly as I did, but I'm just not having fun with it. There's way too many distractions in the form of minigames and menial map activities that get in the way of the story progression that its honestly been a huge drag for me to play - and it legitimately breaks my heart. I have been obsessed with ff7 for 2 decades and for this game to be so unenjoyable for me is very upsetting. I feel that my tastes in gaming have changed and now when I hear the words ""open world"" I immediately assume the game is going to be bloated and bland - sadly, ff7 has not changed my perception on that matter in the way that I thought it would. My excitement for this trilogy has effectively ended, as melodramatic as that may be, its the truth. Sure the game is beautiful, the characters are bright and fun, and I'm sure the story will be good when I eventually come back to try and finish it, but I just can't right now. I honestly can't recommend this game, not even to fans of remake - its too different and the pacing has been completely destroyed by its open world design. If you wouldn't be willing to pick up the newest assassin's creed game I wouldn't pick rebirth up either. TLDR: the open world oriented rebirth pales in comparison to the evenly paced and focused experience of remake. I don't recommend this game.",7,2024-03-27,PLAYSTATION 5,user

jjonezy83,"If review bombing is a thing so is over hyping. This game is being over hyped and when you bring up the issues with the game ovee hypers ignore what is being said, they lie, or make up excuses. Issues with the game GRAPHICS - this game is a mixed bag. Cutscenes look good. But you can tell the models have changed from Remake. In my opinion remakes character models look much better. Where cutscenes look good sadly not the same can be said about the in game character models. The characters look ugly. No where on par with cutscene models. There are also issues with lighting. Over saturation to just bad lighting making characters look very awkward. Besides issues with in game models there are issues with the environment at times. Ground goes blurry especially can notice when talking with chadley. During the chicken quest the ground looks unfinished and doesnt look like grass. Many rock formations in the game lacking textures. Wood pieces look like pieces of plastic and have a weird gloss to them. Some glitches in the game ie cutscenes like your vehicles wheels stop spinning but you are still moving forward then the wheels move again. One quest had a character sinking through the ground in cosmo canyon. Game suffers from pop ins ever location in the game. Both Remake and Final Fantasy 16 look and perform better than Rebirth MINI GAMES- Game has way too many mini games. Not even og ff7 have any where near the amount of mini games. The games are not even fun, but come across as a chore. There were already mini games in Remake. They return in rebirth so they have you replaying games from the previous game with more annoying steps or changes made to the mini game than there was before. In rebirth you are forced to play the mini games as some are linked to romance boost or a decent item. Some are part of the story ie unlocking chocobos. The amont of mini games ruin the flow of the game and interfere with the story driven aspect of the game. Quests would had been better than the constant number of mini games. There are easily over 50 mini game levels. STORY- The story was a let down. After finishing the game the story felt forced and confusing. None of the multiverse makes any sense. Ie zack going to save aerith and cloud but then is shown trying to save biggs. But then biggs dies out of the blue for no reason. Just to get shot and killed out of the blue. Another example Aerith was saved by cloud when sephiroth went to stab her. Cloud blocked his blade but aerith is still acts like she is stabbed. No blood. Like she had a heart attack. There are many other multiverse issues. Whispers are back even though they were defeated in Remake so they shouldnt be around anymore dealing with fate. Story is definitely forced and doesnt make a lick of sense. OPEN WORLD- this game is beyond boring when it comes to the open world aspect. The devs picked the laziest and easiest way of doing open world. Each region is the same as every region in the game. The over world map of the region has towers to get to like zelda breath of the wild. They show you the locations of them.everything is eventually shown to you so you cant miss anything. Lifespring crystal, unique monster fights, protorelics. Everything is shown on your map and they are the same in every region. It is rinse and repeat for every region. Do it for one region then do it all over again for the next. Nothing new in each regions or making things unique to each region. The only thing changes from each region is the environments and the mini games involved for the protorelics. One region might have you play an action board game (fort condor) and another region might have you trying to take down enough cactuar with in a time limit. Each region has its own chocobo mini game to unlock a chocobo with a certain ability that helps explores that region. Rinse and repeat for next region. Its the rinse and repeat that is very boring in this game.

darkgeekrocker,"Story was ok, alot of it felt ""chasing Sephiroth"" with some, ""lawl, twist ending leaving many questions"" Then the other 80% of the game is Ubisoft-bs boring side quest/filler. Find this, do this 4 times, fight this reskinned enemy, etc etc Alot of handholding too by default. You literally get a short tutorial on how to use a character against the final boss. Best parts? - Characters: Barret, Barret saves this game alot of the times. Tifa and Clouds conversation feels well written. Yuffie adds energy to a boring drag ****. RedXII is good up to a point before a reveal (apparently a regional thing I was unaware off, so a pass, even if I don't agree with it) and Cait turned out better than expected (minus a horrible forced minigame.. f- that box throwing bs). Cloud exists. I do wish there was more dialogue/banter while you travel around the maps since that's like 80 hours of your first playthrough, alot of the time it's silence until battles or your near an icon point. -Maps are well made. only complaint i have is the hand holding ""reveal the map"" crap, so natural discovery and exploration doesn't apply here. very beautiful spots and traversal. -Dynamic Music SAVES this game so many times. if your ever going into game development, this feature is always a welcomed addition to making the game feel alive.",6,2024-03-26,PLAYSTATION 5,user

The devs put a lot of thought and time into the story and the character relationships, which was missing in FF7 OG. I know the ending is hotly debated in the community right now, but personally, I think it makes sense and is aligned with how OG is set up. This is probably one of the best open-world games I have played since Elden Ring. The game world is colorful and has interesting scenery, and each region looks unique. Also, the mini-game options were plentiful and varied. A few things that prevent me from giving this game a 10 are the boring and annoying Chadley world intel side quests, the menu UI, and the skill and weapon upgrade trees, which I think are a downgrade compared to the FF7 Remake.",9,2024-03-11,PLAYSTATION 5,user

actuallyNull,"A phenomenal game ripe with content to engage with. STORY: The story is, DEFINITELY, not for everyone. If you've hated the Remake's storytelling, you will not like this. If you like me are not entirely on board with the changes but loved the rendition of places, people and story beats that mirrored the original in Remake, you will LOVE this. GRAPHICS: The game is, clearly, made to be in keeping with the aesthetic established in Remake. This unfortunately means the game does look like a roided out PS4 game at a glance. With that said, it's not in the graphical aspect that the improvements were made over the previous game, but in the scope: the game has several open maps, all considerably large and offering verticality, all BEAUTIFULLY crafted and offering a plethora of breathtaking vistas. The world of VII has truly NEVER looked this good, and been this open. MUSIC: The OST alone is worth the price tag of the game. Bow wow wow, bow wow wow. GAMEPLAY: Oh boy. If you liked the combat in Remake, this will leave your jaw on the floor. The combat is flashier, snappier and enriched by the new synergies which provide not only extra options of considerable power (at no ATB expense!) but also further abilities ""charged"" up by ATB consumption which offer a plethora of benefits between stronger limit breaks, infinite MP and extended enemy stagger time or enhanced stagger damage. The combat will literally speak for itself but, in my opinion, it is the best combat the series has ever had, and should really be considered as the staple of ARPGs all around. It's just that damn good. Combat aside, the game offers a LOT (and I cannot hammer this point enough, a LOT, SO MANY) of minigames everywhere. From card games, to chocobo races or obstacle courses, to fall guys, virtual boxing, dolphin riding and so, so, so much more, the game offers a ludicrous amount of side activities, the vast majority of which entirely optional, that is sure to keep you entertained for hours and hours on end to reap all the rewards. Seriously, it's got to be like at LEAST 40 minigames. It's insane and LOTS of fun. Ignore those who say it's ""too much"", some are mandatory for a short bout without overstaying their welcome and the rest are ENTIRELY optional, and can be tackled freely whenever you feel like it, if at all! OVERALL: The game isn't perfect, be it for some objectively lackluster things or personal taste, but it is without a doubt THE best Final Fantasy game of the last 20 or so years, and definitely one of the best RPGs in general of recent times. A fantastic experience well, WELL worth its price; considering I have cleared the game, not 100%, I mean story wise, by doing the majority of the side content, in 130 hours. At a $70 pricepoint, that's basically half a dollar per hour of GOOD FUN. That's a hell of a bargain if you ask me. Absolutely DO buy and play this game, especially if you at least found Remake enjoyable. This blows it right out of the stratosphere.",10,2024-03-26,PLAYSTATION 5,user

WillTheThinker,"I just now beat Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 2: Rebirth No Spoilers: This game proved to me 3 Things above all else: 1) This IS the greatest cast of characters of ALL TIME. The greatest companion chemistry, banter, and voice acting EVER put into a Video Game. You truly feel attached to these characters. 2) This IS The Game of The Year 3) This IS One of the Great Games of All Time Score: 10/10 (Despite several very frustrating segments that you will need to look up a guide on how to do) After putting 110 Hours into the game and doing all the side quests and open world activities (except the final sidequest at Gold Sauce and the last Protorelic Quest Thread because they were too hard just watched them in YT) I have experienced everything it has to offer and loved it. TIPS (Again No Spoilers): 1) DO NOT feel bad looking up guides or YouTube videos on how to do or get past certain parts. While this is an amazing game, there are several extremely frustrating and almost impossible to do side quests and main story segments without looking up how to do it. 2) Cloud's Focus Thrust and Tifa are your best friends for Staggering. 3) Save Before Every Side Quest (a couple Side quests have mini games that you can fail and you can't redo them) 4) DO NOT finish every side quest involving Red 13 until after the 2nd Gold Saucer Date in Chapter 12 otherwise you will get him. Make an extra save before going to sleep in the hotel in chapter 8 and 12 in case you don't get the dates you want so you can go back and do more sidequests with the person you do want to boost their affinity over the one you don't want. I actually reloaded a save and had to do an extremely hard side quest involving Chocobo racing in chapter 12 in order to get Tifa on the date since my affinity for Red 13 and Tifa were maxed out and i got Red at first so just a heads up save some sidequests for after the 2nd Date. (The main story will tell you when you can't go back when you get to the final area by sea, just say NO and then you can finish all the sidequests left over after the gold saucer date but before the point of no return) 5) DO all the Protorelic Quests in the open world sections (don't worry about the last one in the ocean though just watch it on YouTube since it's secret boss level hard) the cutscenes in the Protorelic Sidequests are extremely important to the main story. DO NOT feel bad setting the difficulty to Easy to get through the Cosmo Canyon Protorelic Minigame (it needs to be patched it's almost impossible) just set it back to normal when you are done. 6) The side quests in Rebirth are WAY better than remake I recommend doing them all (Except for the final party animal quest at Gold Saucer and the final Protorelic quest in the ocean) they add a lot go characterization and main story elements just remember to focus on the ones with the person you want to take on the date get that person's affinity to max save most of the rest for after chapter 12 date but before point of no return Please Don't Post Spoilers in the Comments",10,2024-03-26,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Calarague,"FFVII OG is an eternal masterpiece. A perfect blend of melancholy, darkness, joy and mystery. Rebirth attempts to extrapolate on the story and does so rather well on several occasions. Some of the scenes are an absolute delight. The environments are gorgeous. It is truly elating to follow our beloved characters on their not-so-unknown-journey continuation. However, Rebirth does not dare stray from the OG and never has the audacity to make any significant scenaristic change. For this reason it lacks the emotional punch we had come to expect. Sure enough the game hints at possible scenaristic changes, opens a few doors, but ultimately fails to deliver on that front. The semi-open world side-content is a nightmare. No game should ever make a player go through this. If they aimed for absolute boredom they absolutely nailed it. None of the side quests have any narrative interest either, unless you enjoy running after hens. Frankly, it all feels like chores. It’s hard to fathom how they could be satisfied with making all of this pointless and repetitive map content. The game structure can be summarized as follows: 4 hours of excruciating side content hassle > 1 hour of main story gameplay > 20 minutes of cinematic reward > new area, repeat... Anyhow – there is obivously a lot more to say, but i’ll leave you with this. Rebirth is a polarizing, conflicting experience for sure. It has highs and lows. It's Goty, for sure, but it also techically ****. I hated playing it, but the fan in me loves it all the same. For what it’s worth, i’m forever grateful to Square for FFVII. Its story, characters, world, music are always with me. And I cannot stress enough how thrilled I am to share the experience with my daughter today. So...

himynameissam,"Favorite game of all time and hopeful for GOTY. This game is the perfect example of giving so much more than is expected. This game was designed as a labor of love and I'm obsessed. Rebirth has set the golden standard for game remakes. (hoping Zelda will take notes) I clocked 170hrs of gameplay when writing this review. Rebirth can be appreciated from a casual play through or, imo, you can choose to dive into its depth and nuances, and be blown away. The ending after a first play through seems underwhelming, but watch some YouTube videos and play it again, it feels so natural and well written, with tons of foreshadowing all over. Queens blood can be just an interesting, forced mini game or you can complete its entire story line, and even after that, collect all the cards and complete all the challenges in costa del sol. Main scenario combat can be relatively straight forward with some tough spots or you can put your skills and strategy to the test with late game combat simulator trials and hard mode. (combat is easy to learn, hard to master) You can do the baseline expectations for mini games or you can spend time mastering each of their patterns and strategy. The open world is incredibly dense and while some tasks do become a little (hardly) tedious, they are always incredibly rewarding. The level of unlocking in this game is wild. As soon as you complete a series of tasks, you're rewarded with unlocking new tasks and areas, making this game feel massive. The characters have incredible detail in their facial expressions and their humor is spot on. Just about every single side character in this game is great and they even redeemed the side characters in Remake. Quests are top notch and even when you think you've explore the entire map, quests will still get you venturing to new spots on your map, in addition to adding well executed side story. 9.5/10 for me. (not a perfect 10 because the story isn't conclusive yet) I love how much they delivered in this game and didn't cater to just casual or serious players. Quite frankly I'm terrified to see how they try to live up to the expectations they've laid for the final game.",10,2024-03-25,PLAYSTATION 5,user

yojimbo94,"Rebirth does a great job at capturing this part of the original game and expanding on them for the most part. There's a few hiccups here and there with pacing as well as a story decision or two that I wasn't crazy about. But overall the characters are handled wonderfully, the combat has improved over remake in every way, and the open world is pretty decent by today's standards. Granted it can be pretty ""ubisoft"" like, the rewards for doing things within the world are actually decent rewards you'll actually use like materia, or equipment. The music is also incredible but that doesn't shock anyone with this series. The only reason I give this a 9 instead of a 10 are the pacing and the story changes I didn't like. Overall, amazing game that any 7 fan should play.",9,2024-03-06,PLAYSTATION 5,user
DaicoXXI,"Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth es mejor que el juego base original (1997) y que el FFVII Remake (2020). En comparación al de 19997 este nuevo capítulo de la saga de Cloud, Tifa, Aeris y compañía... está mejor explicado, aunque sea más complejo y enrevesado que el original. Tiene más personajes y mejor construidos. Mucha más y mejor historia de su universo, con más lore e intrahistorias. Con un villano actualizado aún más terrible que el original, Sefirot es la malignidad en busca de la eternidad donde atarnos a todos bajo su yugo y el de JÉNOVA ""La Calamidad""... La jugabilidad y los combates son Excelentes! Su Mundo abierto por secciones o mapas grandes, es bello y está llenísimo de contenido, que aunque repetitivas algunas acciones, encargos o misiones no llegan a cansar y siempre aportan algo. Tanto la jugabilidad como los combates son frenéticos a la vez de estratégicos; en dificultad adaptada a tu nivel de personaje, ya que en difícil (se obtiene esta dificultad tras acabar por primera vez toda la historia principal en un NG+) es todo un reto realmente exigente, que solo se consigue avanzar en esta dificultad en una NG+ porque si no sería literalmente imposible. Música y banda sonora pasa directamente a la posteridad de los videojuegos. Nobuo Uematsu a otro level. Las piezas increíbles, épicas, tiernas, románticas, tensas y maravillosas; e incluso los temas más melancólicos por ser parte del juego base original se pueden tocar en el minijuego del piano, en sus versiones de filarmónica y esto es algo MARAVILLOSO! aunque algunas piezas de secciones concretas son muy pesadas, en zonas del mundo abierto o regiones o poblaciones como en Gongaga, en mi opinión. El FFVII Remake es la antesala de esta Obra Maestra de los JRPGs que es el FFVII:REB. Y por eso el primer capítulo de esta saga, al lado de este segundo (como si fuese el segundo CD del original) se queda corto en comparación o queda demasiado encorsetado. Este FFVII:REB es mejor en todos sus apartados que su antecesor y su juego base original. Además es el REMAKE soñado o deseado que tuvieron muchísimos fans de este capítulo de la saga de las fantasías finales hecho en 1997. Ahora en 2024 este REBIRTH es la OBRA MAESTRA que nos prometieron. Solo de pensar en el tercer y último capítulo, en el desenlace de esta epopeya... hace que la espera sea hasta llena de temor porque no salga bien, porque no nos de la vida para llegar verlo y jugarlo de aquí a 4 o 5 años...?? TERRIBLE!! pero rezaremos al Planeta, rezaremos a GAIA para que estemos en este plano y que nada nos pueda parar para estar y jugar y completar ese último capítulo. Y por supuesto que mantenga las altas cotas de este segundo capítulo, que ya es una obra maestra para la corriente vital de los videojuegos. se puede decir alto y claro Final Fantasy VII: REBIRTH es una OBRA MAESTRA!",10,2024-03-25,PLAYSTATION 5,user

The characters are an absolute delight, the music score is incredible, the combat and mini-games are fun and engaging, the optional side quests are far better than FF7 Remake. This video game has an immense amount of personality and easily took over 100 hours for me to complete my first playthrough. I was having too much fun and was not in a hurry to advance the main story. I did not want the adventure to end, but the journey will continue in a future game, that will close out the FF7 remake/rebirth trilogy.

Rondyr,"This game **** absolute ass. Four long years I waited for Rebirth, and all I got was a game filled with dozens of unbelievably crappy mini-games with an occasional hour or two of Marvel Multiverse nonsense. I have never hated any game as much as I hate Rebirth, and I would give anything to be able to return in and get my money back. Oh sure, you don’t “have to do” some of the mini-games, but if you don’t you don’t get the weapons and weapon abilities or materia locked behind them. So you really don’t have much of a choice but to play the damn things. How Squeenix could have possibly screwed up so badly is as confusing to me as how it’s getting “rave reviews” from so-called “critics”. This game ****, and the only thing that could help save it is a ‘Mercy System’ that allows you to eventually pass the mini-games after you’ve failed so many times that you’ve thrown your controller through the wall.

BeastLordJ,"Just Finished the Game last Night and WOW. Not even sure where to begin. The orginal game had a lot of open space in terms of story going from Kalm to Neilbhiem. With that being said everything utilized to expand the story and the connection to the characters was done naturally and Wonderfully. Every Area is an experiance in itself. Yes some areas are a bit confusing, but conidering one is a Jungle and the other a Canyon, I feel the captured the heart of what these should feel like perfectly. Going From Junon to Cosmo for examples are so different in feeling and the presentation of events it almost feel like your playing a different game. Each filled with well thought out side quest to give background on the areas , the people themselves and a overall better veiwon life while noticing the subtle changes counting down to the end of the world. I'm not even mentioning the new parts of the story. What septh really wants, how Zacks involved. I personally enjoyed and love that they explained everything using the natural laws ff7 orginal made and kept with it. Comabt itself is a much smoother experiance thats been greatly expained. the sheer amount of builds I have created with each charcater is maddening and SOOOOOO Fun. Chi trap tank tifa is one of my favorite things in the world. Or Quad cast synergy Yuffie with Balistics Aeirth. I love that they left the combat open enough with materia to exeriment while making it easier to control other characters if you dont care to use them. There are a LOT of mini games. But out of the 20+ only 2 or 3 I didnt **** only 5 of them or so you're forced to do. The rest are optional, usually very short unless you're going for all rankings, then they pose a challenege. Chadster's VR challenges can get very hard late game as well. Side content was creative, much of it sad. Maybe they could have been a little harsher with how some charcaters acted. For instance Barret when it comes to quest involving helping others fix Mako powered machines. I dont even need to mention music, you know it's a 200 out of 10. I loved how they have much of the sound track just sound like remade version of the orginals almost exactly. But then also a lot of new that just blows your mind. Overall the end game was Mind blowing. once again no clue whats coming in part three. But clouds mindset is terrifying, the part is scared and **** things you're never suppose to have we have now LOL. I'm scared but I'm here for the ride. If square ever happens to graze over this I hope they put half the love they put in this in all of there games from now on. any other slight complaints I have arean;t even really complaints.

Rebirth, I just finished, and I doubt I will ever play through again. Thank god I played it on easy. Combat is a mess, they ruined their original perfection by adding more, and power creeping combatants. Open world is over done, and not skippable in my opinion, mini games are also over done, too much of the best materia and items locked behind boredom and frustration. I could understand not carrying things over from Remake (summons - like, really? the worst most useless aspect of Remake you carry over?) but I just didn't really enjoy re-grinding materia, some of it just plain worse than the original game.

ArdhazzGamer,"(MY SCORE : 9.5 /10) One of the Game Series from Final Fantasy VII, which looks like it can compete to be one of the GOTY 2024 nominees! This game is a continuation of the Final Fantasy VII Remake Series, and Cloud Strife, a former member of SOLDIER remains the main character in this game. Joins a group that is considered a terrorist, Avalanche, namely Barret Wallace, Tifa Lockhart, Aerith Gainsborough, and Red XIII. And in the next journey, Yuffie Kisaragi and Caith Sith (a robot cat who is actually controlled by Reeve Tuesti, a member of Shinra!) join the non-playable characters, Cid Highwind and Vincent Valentine. The ending in this game is of course against Sephiroth. Sephiroth tells Cloud that there have been countless Alternate Worlds after the destruction of the Arbiter of Fate, and Sephiroth wishes to unite them all under his rule. From here, Aerith emerged from various alternative worlds, some of whom were killed by Sephiroth! The appearance of one Aerith who could only be seen by Cloud, who could not be seen by other Avalanche members, after her death also raised a question mark: is this a manifestation of Cloud's thoughts? What is certain is that at the end of the story we have to say ""Goodbye"" to Aerith in that world, not in another Alternative World!",9,2024-03-24,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Martins_Luis,"Rebirth a logrado superar mis expectativas en todos los sentidos. Si el remake ya era un juegazo que le dio mucha profundidad cada uno de los personajes y innovo con su sistema de combate, Rebirth lo hace todo mejor. Un mundo abierto espectacular, lleno de minijuegos bien hechos, probablemente el mejor sistema de combate de cualquier Final Fantasy, una historia emocionante y muy fiel al original.

AndreyCloud,"This game was a tough one to rate, every time I think of all the good and fun parts of the game, I also remember the long and frustrating parts. Overall, the game is great: the story is engaging and unique, the relationship building with different dialogues are interesting, there is A LOT to do in the game, combat feels great for the most part, the game looks amazing with amazing recreations of cities like Kalm, Cosmo Canyon, and Junon, and customizing Materia and party members is great. Where the game falls of for me is the insane length it took to complete, 93 hours of running world exploration quests start to feel too repetitive after 6 (plus the ocean) explorable open world massive locations. Over 140 Gb of stuff to do, it does feel nice to have a lot to do, but after playing AC Valhalla I do think games can be a little too long. The excessive amount of minigames started to wear me out, some of the side quests were bangers, but a good number of them felt kind of wack. The vibe of the game felt a little too goofy and even cringy at times compared to the first game, but others may love this kind of vibe, just a matter of preference. Still a fun experience definitely worth the time and money, however after 93 hours I have no interest in even attempting hard mode like I did in the first game. The game still followed the basic FF7 story with some interesting unique twists and I am very much looking forward to see how the story ends.",8,2024-03-22,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Rebirth feels like a return to form that I haven’t felt since Final Fantasy 12. And while, yes, there are some graphical hiccups, and quite a few of the mini games can be rage inducing, it does t take away from the fact that I’m always ready for the next part.

This game makes final fantasy 7 remake feel like it was a mere demo. If you like RPGs or any other final fantasy games, this is a must play. I suppose the only negative I can think of is every time you complete a task (world intel, combat, protorelic, etc) in the open world - Chadley pops on a device to carry to chime in, and it gets gets old real quick.

Story shoots right for the feels and nostalgia and mostly hits. Seemingly endless and varied mini games that both call back to and build upon what was in the original. Only real knocks are some pacing issues and bloat. Most of the bloat is avoidable but it can creep into the main content, which gets frustrating when nearing the climax of the game. Only mildly impacts the overall experience but must be noted as there are a few baffling offenders I can’t see anyone enjoying. Still a must play if you are a fan of the series or this style of game.

Esto es un sueño hecho realidad y esperó que de aquí en adelante la saga siga por este camino ya que han tomado todo lo bueno que ha hecho grande a esta franquicia y lo han potenciado.

Only comparable to other great successes such as Red Dead Redemption 2, The Witcher 3, God of War or the recent Baldur's Gate 3. FF7 R combines excellent gameplay, an impeccable narrative and epic and visual moments. The musical section is extraordinary, with songs that will remain in my head until the end of my life. One could not expect less from Nobuo Uematsu's team. Square has managed to surpass the legendary game, which led Sony Playstation to become the undisputed leader in video games. For this reason, it is not an exaggeration to say that FF7's relationship with Playstation has an almost mystical aspect, similar to the relationship between Zelda and Nintendo.

oathkeeper12,"Phenomenal game that brings Final Fantasy back to the feeling you had in the SNES/PS1 era. This game is by and away the largest video game I've ever played completely seamless. You can literally run from the edge of one continent all the way to the other side of another continent, going into houses in towns, dungeons, combat, across the ocean, up ladders completely without a single loading/black screen. The only time it loads is combat simulations and quick travel. Its absolutely insane how large this game is encompassing nearly the entire world map of the original FFVII in game with impeccable detail in every corner. Sure theres a small bit of pop-in here and there (and a few low quality textures of minor objects) but its nothing serious enough to detract from the experience in my opinion. This game has breathtaking visuals and a draw distance that'd make most games weep. The music is great, the gameplay is improvements spectacular, and the character interactions are all extremely fun and I love how much each character got their own moment t shine both in the story and in the sidequests. This is the Final Fantasy I imagined playing back in 6th gen that we never got (I say this as someone who loved X, but it was a step back in world design compared to 4-9). Yes, there are a LOT of minigames, but most of them are actually fun (which is rare in a jrpg), I'm honestly surprised there wasnt any fishing though. I feel like I've seen a lot of people complaining that some of the minigames are mandatory when the ones that are are NOT difficult (and you can even change the difficulty to make them easier if you have trouble), it only gets difficult if you want the platinum trophy in the game and want to do EVERYTHING, which is not required to complete the game (or even get through most of the side content). The ending was kind've messy to me personally, but thats such a small portion of huge game that it doestn take away from the journey getting there!

The other point of contention being exhaustion on ending/ stuff again. The word ""multiverse"" just feels like an excuse for issues with writing, i shouldn't have to play multiple other games to understand this story/ compilation.

Gr8Vngnz,"The first half of this game is fantastic. Well written, well thought out, excellent character work, addictive combat and fun mini games. But, man, does the game outstay it's welcome after that. The open world gameplay loop eventually becomes laborious, the main story meandering, and the pacing which was so good early on falls off a cliff. I'm at Chapter 13 now but really struggling to justify completing the game and feel I'm just wasting my time. Because the story really needs another battle against the Turks doesn't it?!?! At a time when the industry is seeing mass layoffs, I cannot fathom the stupidity of making games like The Last of Us: Part 2, and FFVII: Rebirth way longer than they need to be. There's nothing wrong with an open world RPG being upwards of a hundred hours, but it MUST be justified and should not hamper the pacing. The amount of random filler after the halfway point is ridiculous. Early on, the game was a strong 9/10 for as good as it was, there are a litany of minor bug-bears that frustrate, but having gotten over 80 hours in, I've almost lost all interest. And I will almost always finish a game when I've invested enough time in it. The best thing is devs will complain about how expensive games are to make when they are the ones who are wasting fortunes overextending their games, and in the process wasting my time. I do wonder how many reviewers actually completed the game, or whether the scores they gave are based off of the first half. Just a thought, and maybe it's just me.",7,2024-03-19,PLAYSTATION 5,user

And I already lost count of how many times the game made me cry, but it was at least 5, it's that incredible.

twelveozuyu,"This second entry to the trilogy blows the first out of the water. While FF7 Remake brought the nostalgia, the world of Rebirth makes the first entry look like a prologue and brings back adventure (with the right levels of comic relief) to the RPG space. The narrative design is fluid, allowing players that are familiar with mechanics of Remake have an expanded experience yet still introducing new mechanics that make this game feel fresh for new players. The scale is massive and really makes the city of Midgar feel tiny, with a substantial number of things to do while expanding on characters and enriching the story of FF7. The dev team has reached new heights with Rebirth, but I believe has reached the plateau of the game engine's capabilities. This game is an adventure, and we can only imagine how far it can go in the final entry of this remake trilogy. Truly historic.",10,2024-03-18,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Akumako,"Finished my first playthrough after 85 hours. This is everything I love about Final Fantasy. It probably has the best gameplay, music and characterisation in the entire series and some of the best in gaming in general. The exploration is probably the weakest part since most of the points of interest end up repeating themselves, but the feeling of going on a big adventure with your friends is immaculate, and there is a ton of things to do that actually feel rewarding in a lot of different ways. The synergy abilities and friendship system are great additions to this title as well that really make you feel the bond between these characters strenghten. This game also probably has some of the best towns I have seen in any video game ever. There are tons of minigames, and so inevitably some of them feel pretty stiff and not as good as others. Now for the most controversial point, the ending. I still don't know if I loved it or not. It feels like they are trying to get to the same resolution as the OG but by adding some plot twists. Honestly that ending felt very eerie but by wanting to confuse the player they kind of messed up an iconic moment imo. The game has its flaws but the qualities are so overwhelming that it ealisy makes it a 10/10 for me. This has become the game I would recommend as the entry point for the series to newcomers instead of FFX.",10,2024-03-18,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Snowberries,"Massive improvement over the Remake, story and combat is excellent. In the beginning, I just wanted to rush through the game, but decided to max out every single zone in the process because I was genuinely having fun. In the end, it took me 90 hours from start to finish. Truly worth the price, and you can tell that they put a lot of love into the game. I haven't played the original, but I really enjoyed what they did with the story. This time around, even though there is no real conclusion to the overall story, I felt like I got a complete experience, and I can't wait to see what they'll do with the 3rd part. The only thing I didn't like was how I felt that they were trying to force Tifa on me at some points, but I would imagine that Tifa fans might have felt the same about Aerith at times so I'm not going to make this a point in the rating. Aerith is just my personal preference.",10,2024-03-18,PLAYSTATION 5,user

I love the exploration, the music, the visuals, the world and especially its characters - each of them felt real and relatable, voice acting is top notch too! There were several occasions I laughed so hard and moments where I gasped in awe, this game is so magical and they balanced humour so well in their excellent writing. I finished the game yesterday and I'm invested in where the story is going, it's not the same as the OG but I'll let the devs cook and I trust they will finish it well. I'm experiencing postgame depression now, going to take a mental break and get back again to finish the rest of the mini-games and stuff.

However, some of the mini-games and side-quests dragged the overall experience down a notch. Despite its strong start, it ended up feeling bloated and a little frustrating.

Garysanderson96,"The sequel for Final Fantasy VII: Remake The plot is, as always, good. Square Einx really made me cry in this one. However, I would only give this one 8/10 due to a few things. - Too much mini-games and bosses. I understand that they need to make the game more improved than the OG FF7, but holy, so many mini-games needed to be done to progress the story. And to many bosses fight too. - That leads to the game drag on for too long. I feel like it's longer than Remake.

Kenken978,本作沒能拿到好的銷售成績感到遺憾，對於把FF7視為奠定時代神作的我來說，這一次的遊戲表現是真的很理想的，不管是小遊戲，豐富的支線，每個角色完整且豐沛的描述（尤其是巴雷特，第八章的演出真的讓人感同身受），更別提獨數一格的戰鬥系統，看起來難且複雜，實際上只要理解了戰鬥時的樂趣真的很棒，何況這套系統目前就只有FF7重製系列使用，市面上根本找不到類似的作品 所以覺得真的有點可惜....看第一周的銷售表現就知道大家並不喜歡把故事拆開來講，跟他是在什麼平台已經沒有關係了 唯一可挑剔的是，節奏容易被小遊戲帶走，其實他都有設計成可以只玩一次甚至略過的方式，這樣子主線就不至於感受低。 但玩過原版就知道，原來FF7 就真的是一整排小遊戲，現在只是強化過並發揚光大而已，還沒有哪一個小遊戲是不認真制作的 關於主線，我認為在最後一部會很豐滿，因為除了原版的結局外，AC可以想見的會製作進去，這樣子在第三部勢必可以體會到FF7世界的魅力，只希望別太久以及不要再用UE4做了，不然一直被嫌棄背景真的無言,10,2024-03-08,PLAYSTATION 5,user

That it picks up the crumbs that remake left with. But it doesn't. The narrative is actually fantastic if you don't count the ending. The feeling you are left with is a overwhelming sense of ""lameness."" If after Remake the story got you hyped for part 2, the ending will not get you hyped for part 3. Which is very very sad. It actually feels like they had 2 completely different narrative teams wrote the story and there's no connective tissue that relates the themes of the first game to the second.

CactuarJack,"If you are an og FF7 fan then this game will be a 12/10 for you. If not then a 10/10 will suffice. Seeing the world of Final Fantasy 7 modernized and expanded upon is amazing. Story and open areas are beautiful and fun, story is compelling, combat is amazing, and tons of side content to check out. If you’re a trophy hunter the side content can be a lot, but it’s all optional and the entirety of the story and the weight behind it can be experienced without doing much of it. As always for a Final Fantasy game the music is amazing. The characters are amazing and it’s easy to get invested in them and this world. Direct feedback for the creators: - The ending is fumbled and too convoluted and honestly a bit disappointing. Also, so much for being able to change fate/future being what you make it. - Too much Chadley. He’s tied to every piece of exploration. Hopefully not the case next game - Certain narrative elements with the multiple timelines fall flat and don’t seem to have a point With that said: This is the best, and most content dense, RPG game I’ve played in a long time.

Every single area has the same points of interest you have to tic, and oh boy it gets annoying after a while. Even some parts of the story are dragging out a lot.

DutchDread,"A pretentious bloating mess. This is what you get when game designers try to be clever, a story that by trying to go ten layers deep fails to properly tell the actual story. More than any other game I've ever seen this game mistakes flash and pretentiousness for quality, choosing to devote its runtime on setting up convoluted mysteries rather than focusing on the human story that lay at the heart of the original. Since you have no idea what's going on you wont care either. There isn't a clear story with a twist that you sense you should be able to grasp, and that will be satisfyingly answered by the story. Instead you get a bunch of weird crap where you can't know what's going on anyway since everything is so far removed from human experience that your eyes roll in the back of your head and you just check out. The first part of the game is done expertly enough, but the cracks start showing early. When the game is just trying to tell the story of FFVII it is mostly fine, the problem is that the story of FFVII is built on the bonds between the characters, in this part mostly Cloud and Aerith. But the developers were so excited to get past that boring FFVII stuff and get you to experience all the new ""clever story concepts"" they've invented that said connection never gets to shine, and as a result when both the old and new tries to build off of that it fails spectacularly because the overload of stuff happening made it so that we never got to really understand the characters or see them grow together. Rather than taking the time to properly set-up connections between some of the characters the game is too busy sniffing its own farts and thinking its clever. But the real problem is with the ending, where an event originally known for its subversion of the classic hollywood drama now becomes the most convoluted and drama filled cheap spectacle of all time. I could make an hour long video on everything that was mishandled in this game, and I might actually do so, for now just know that this game had the dumbest, most poorly mishandled ending I have EVER had the misfortune to sit through. At about stage 10 of the boss fight I had mentally completely checked out, barely even bothering to keep my characters alive and taking long hour brakes in between stages because despite sinking 100 hours into the game over the course of a week I just could not be bothered sitting through this exercise in torment. The developers apparently think their audience is too uncultured to sit through a somber and sober ending, and think the trick to a satisfying ending is scale and spectacle. This game is a waste of your time and money, just play the original, it tells the story better.",2,2024-03-16,PLAYSTATION 5,user

The lack of creativity and sticking to the original story, makes no sense when they've revamped all the mini games. Also everything is behind a mini game. This game is like playing Mario party, except if Mario party was really bad. I was a big fan of the original FF7, but the game play is punishing if you don't do exactly how the developer wants. 50-50 as to whether to play. Should have been the game to set a standard, but the action in the game is confusing, hard to see and without good animations by the enemies you often take loads of damage without seeing it coming.

rgqw67,"A perfect follow up to the Final Fantasy 7 Remake building upon core gaming mechanics and often ""correcting"" criticisms of the original Remake. The game, similar to Remake, mostly follows the same trodden path as the OG FF7 and includes significant world building around the wider FF7 compilation and FF7 world. The game is in itself huge with my first playthrough coming in at 104 hours but it was an absolute joy and I look forward to the Hard mode. It is staggering just how big this game is. In terms of critiques, there are certain story elements which occur with fragile logic but this is very minimal. The core gameplay continues to be enjoyable, though I felt certain new characters introduced in Rebirth (from a gameplay standpoint) weren't improvents on the core cast. Furthermore some quests can be repetitive and some mini games border on the infuriating when trying to achieve the top scores available. At the end of the day, realistically what do you expect from a game of this scope? In every way this is above and beyond any rational expectation and we should be considering just how well this game has been put together. It's difficult to remake a game where expectations are at the level they are and the development staff have an impossible goal but in any timeline this is the best version of what this game could be.

Kostas_Spirou,"A dream come true. Rebirth is an evolution, an improvement from the first game in every single way, a true sequel, and a mind-blowing Remake. I'm absolutely amazed, I didn't expect a game this big, with so much content, a crazy amount of mini-games, and an actual open world map where you can travel seamlessly to other continents and get distracted by random side activities, it's genuinely insane. What surprised me the most though is the fact that combat feels better than ever, the gameplay mechanics are deep, there are so many new materia to use, combos last for way longer, and the addition of the aerial combat helps a ton. It's worth mentioning that this game is actually quite challenging sometimes, I really had to think a lot and play strategically, which is fun obviously, however, I noticed a small difficulty spike near the end, but the epic spectacle fights and gorgeous visuals made every encounter worthwhile. Also, I just have to mention how phenomenal the soundtrack is, like woah, the entire soundtrack features over 400 songs, it's wildl! As for the story, at first I was somewhat worried about the new direction it took, but as I kept playing, I noticed that for the vast majority of the game, the story is very faithful to the original game, and I'm glad! The characters are amazing, the side stories are beautiful, and almost everything was handled with love and respect, and I couldn't be happier. That being said, the only issue I have with the game is the ending. I'm not going to spoil anything, but I just think that it's not executed very well, in fact it's kind of a mess sadly, I like some things about it, but overall it made the story even more confusing than before. That being said, I absolutely love this game, it's a JRPG masterpiece and the best Remake I've played to date, it surpassed its predecessor, and I cannot wait for the third and final chapter of the Final Fantasy VII Remake Trilogy Project. Final Rating: ""Masterpiece"" ~ 10/10.",10,2024-03-01,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Holycrazia,"Amazing game. One of the best I played in years. The story is touching, fun, goofy. In other words it’s just brilliant. The graphic is amazing. The gameplay is spot on. I feel like it has taken some inspiration from Witcher 3, but at the same time made its own. Took me around 60 hour’s to complete, and I was never once bored. This is what every game should inspire to be. Thank you!",10,2024-03-15,PLAYSTATION 5,user
Lenoxkydo,"I've never seen a reimagined universe as vast and well-crafted as the Final Fantasy 7 Remake series. For those who managed to understand the plot, you know that this game is a separate version of the 97 game, remake and rebirth are not just titles but are intrinsic to why this series exists. The story, the battle system, the materia system, the open-world exploration and the minigames are incredible, something that completely clouds the problems the game has with graphical performance. A must play for sure, my favorite game since final fantasy 7 of 97.",10,2024-03-15,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Ldt1,"This is a hard review to do, as a final fantasy fan from the very start this game is 40% one of the best jrpgs I’ve ever played but unfortunately 60% terrible and the bigger half is the overwhelming feeling left after completion. The story and characters are superb with great writing and amazing va’s especially Aerith who I would say is done perfectly, the game environments are stunning with much loved locations lovingly re-created and done so well, the gold saucer is jaw dropping it’s so impressive! They have perfectly captured iconic moments like riding up to the gold saucer for the first time and it reminded me of doing it first time in the original and opens with a beautiful cutscene that I re-watched many times, to very impressive locations like cosmo canyon it’s all fan service and all so impressive, and as we have come to expect the soundtrack is just amazing with remade classics from the original and some very cool original pieces, special mention to gongaga forest. Unfortunately the world / field exploration is where it starts to fall apart and 2 areas in I had had enough, the game is plagued by mini games and when I say that I would say mini games make up 60% of the game and most are not good, terrible controls and camera mixed with some bad decisions end up turning into hours and hours of frustration, the field zones are all like confusing mazes they are not fun to explore and again just end up being frustrating… they should of kept it like the original with them just being used to traverse with fighting it’s a terrible choice they made an epic fail, each area has the exact same things to do rinse and repeated over and over and there’s even Ubisoft style towers you have to climb to unlock the map and it is just a terrible gaming experience. The battle system which I would describe as perfect in remake has ended up being a total mess in rebirth, I loved the mix of old menus and newer action but in rebirth they have forgotten this is a thing, as bosses and even normal enemies do constant knock backs and interrupts so casting is useless and even abilities just get constantly interrupted, then there’s the block / parry as mobs attacks can’t be parried or countered so it just becomes a mess of attack/ block / run away and some boss fights are just a complete mess of what feels like unfair deaths, I thought multiple times why try to fix what wasn’t broken? There’s no recovery or perfect timed counters it’s just block before attack and ride it out or take all the damage if you didn’t, rebirth battle system is a mess as it doesn’t know what it wants to be pure action or a hybrid? Checkpoints are very frustrating as you effortlessly lose hours of progress due to none or the ridiculously confusing continue options of which there is sometimes 5 options that are worded so badly I just thought so how do I continue from where I was? This is a mix of bad design and bad translation I’ve heard of people losing 6-7 hours of area progress which is just unacceptable, even as a gamer who knows to save often in multiple slots I lost progress multiple times especially the end boss fight I lost an hour when I was couple of hits from killing him I had to re-do the whole hour fight, I think 7/10 is a very fair score and this game proves why you can’t trust “official” reviewers, 20 hours in I was praising this as the best game ever before the issues started appearing and this time frame is what the majority of these official reviews are based on, if you think Ubisoft style towers and an insane amount of mini games is a 10/10 well that’s great but there’s no way this game deserves a 9 or 10 in my eyes it’s no where near perfect game material, I think what we have here is a product of the forspoken situation square lost 100 million this was rushed out to balance the books, it feels unfinished/ rushed / untested, they had the formula perfect with remake which I gave a perfect 10 and iam angry this is the rebirth we got, massive back step 7/10",7,2024-03-15,PLAYSTATION 5,user
Khanthedruid,It's bloated with boring side quests that feel like chores. They watered down the original story and cut the prison under golden saucer completely.

A 1:1 Remake would have been far more enjoyable.,2,2024-03-15,PLAYSTATION 5,user
Icyelemental,"As a huge fan of the original game, I went in with low expectations. I found Remake good but not amazing, especially in hard mode. I probably would give that game a 7.5-8/10. But Rebirth is a genuinely amazing game. The team behind the game have paid attention to the fact that long-time lovers of the series have been calling out for a comprehensive world map, and have delivered a world that feels massive, alive and exciting, a feat not achieved by Square since FFXII. This game feels like Square have finally decided to look at the gaming industry as a whole and take inspiration from its peaks. When playing, I have felt the game must have had inspiration from a number of other prolific titles, such as Uncharted, Horizon Forbidden West, Ghost of Tsushima, the Assassin's Creed games, and for sidequest design, Witcher 3. This all combines into an amazing experience for the player, and I simply can't believe they've pulled it off. The depth they have applied to your interactions with the main party is spectacular, and a truly loyal and believable expansion of the links between characters in the original FF7. While Remake left me with some concern about the direction the team were taking, Rebirth has more than allayed my concerns, and I can not wait to see what they deliver with the third installment, whenever that should be ready to drop. Edit: As my playthrough has continued, I have grown someone weary of the formula of the game and some map design, and some minigames in particular have affected my enjoyment significantly (including, in particular, one that cannot be skipped). For that reason, I am marking this down to an 8.",8,2024-03-15,PLAYSTATION 5,user

However, the player's wish to help Aerith block the sword was still fulfilled, even though blocking it was of no use. The screenwriter's level of skill is really good.

I was very worried about this game, but squenix managed to fill this game with so much effort and care it bleeds out in every interaction. To keep it short the characters alone are exactly how I imagined them years ago. The additional interactions and content expand upon the universe in much needed ways and have not detracted from the original in anyway imo. It hits all the OG story beats and adds so much more. The emotional moments hit hard and the music is solid. I'll trust Nomura and company for now and I greatly look forward to part 3. I hope they end this series with the justice it deserves after so long. If your on the fence about it, then don't be.

Poor enemy animation that barley give any warning before attacks., enemies spin on their heal to hit you. the worst tracking i have ever seen, except for some of your attack that sometimes go opposite of locked on enemy. once i dodged under a jumping worm and it speeen 1080¤ in the air just to hit me. ai will walk into aoe attacks or just stand and block Cheap Instant wipe attack in fights that can last 20 minutes Cheap grab moves that kill or take party member out of fight. Cheap attack that look and are named fire/lighting/ice that don´t count as such and ignore your defense against such elements. hard mode was easy compared to previous game but it turned the game into a cheap clone of Sekiro were you just run around and parry to fill stagger attack. and again. un-skippable cut scenes during battle are annoying to see after every five attacks only to die to instant wipe bs being forced to see them again and again. super toxic minigames that require extreme precision and skill to finish for rewards, some games 20plus try to get reward and there are allot. game literally wants you to learn the piano on sticks, so sad because some minigames are fun but quickly become a place for frustration/anger. and wort of all CHADLEY Never Shuts The F up. while doing side quest and map things, he and i counted in 1 hour he called 20 times. before/after fighting monster he calls, after finding item he calls, after walking he calls... he is everywhere yapping, .you cant even enter or exit combat simulator without him Yapping his nasty gums, and during his yapping cant enter combat simulator or menu some times worst offender is stupid modern square QTE events especially during some emotional cut scenes that ruin whats happening on screen cuz mash dem l2 r2 haptic buttons ahjuuk vewwy fun, said no one ever about QTE Visuals are good in towns and cut scenes but for the most have bad lighting, shadows, draw distance, or blurry image quality, its an Old version of UE4 and goes not feel current gen.",6,2024-03-14,PLAYSTATION 5,user

OwtDaft,"+ Graphics overall look great. + Story is really good with changes making it still fresh. + Music is very good. + The battle system is alot of fun and the synergy between characters gives the sense that the character have bonded since Remake part 1. + The Open world is given in bit so it isn't overwhelming and the different chocobo mounts make exploration in each feel different. + The verity in side content helps prevent the game getting boring while other open world games the side content can feel more like work. The side quest are also very good and some have parts of the map pacifically made for them. - The game has too much side content. I think the towers and the scanning crystals should have been cut from the game. - The mini games are mostly very good. Queens Blood is great and the piano mini games controls are too imprecise. - The mini games do appear in the main story and when the game has so many mini games having them also apear in the main story is a bit overkill. - Music sometimes makes it hard to hear the voices. - Battles towards the end are made difficult by been very cheap. - The ending is confusing and rushed forward earlyer into the story. = Overally I liked Remake part 1 bit more as I prefer the games story focus. Rebirth makes the mistake of having more side content then main story making the side content feel like the main game and the story simply been a means to get the next wave of side content. It's very much a high quality open world style game for those who prefer that and I actally did really enjoy doing the side content which is rare for me. Even though I did have some issue with the game, It still has been the most fun I have had with a game in some time and so it's still got to have high marks.",10,2024-03-14,PLAYSTATION 5,user

TheLoudFellow,"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth stands as a testament to the timeless appeal of Square Enix's iconic RPG, reimagined for a new era. From the moment you're reintroduced to the dystopian world of Midgar, it's evident that this isn't just a graphical overhaul but a meticulous reworking of every facet of the beloved original. Graphically, the game is breathtaking. The meticulously crafted environments are brought to life with stunning detail, while character models are imbued with a level of expressiveness that adds depth to every interaction. Whether you're exploring the slums of Sector 7 or scaling the towering plateaus of Sector 5, every corner of Midgar feels alive and brimming with secrets waiting to be uncovered. But visuals alone do not define Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. The gameplay has been refined and expanded upon, seamlessly blending classic turn-based combat with modern innovations. The revamped Materia system offers a wealth of strategic depth, allowing players to customize their party's abilities to suit their playstyle. Each character feels distinct, with unique skills and abilities that encourage experimentation and mastery. Of course, it wouldn't be Final Fantasy without a captivating narrative, and Rebirth delivers in spades. While staying true to the core storyline that captivated millions, the game weaves in new subplots and character arcs that breathe fresh life into familiar faces. From Cloud's internal struggles to the enigmatic presence of Sephiroth, every moment is infused with emotional resonance that will keep players engaged from start to finish. It's not without its flaws, of course. Some pacing issues crop up in the later chapters, and purists may lament certain deviations from the original plot. However, these minor quibbles pale in comparison to the overall experience offered by Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. In conclusion, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a masterful reimagining **** classic. With its stunning visuals, refined gameplay, and captivating narrative, it sets a new standard for what a remake can achieve. Whether you're a long-time fan or a newcomer to the series, this is an adventure that demands to be experienced.",10,2024-03-14,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Montiero,"This is an amazing game with a lot of minor issues. The combat is by far it's strongest quality but also has some weird mechanics that add up over time to be pretty frustrating. There's a block and a dodge function but dodging nearly never works because enemies track your movement so no matter when you dodge or where, their attack will still land and stagger you. Blocking works but also seems prone to being getting staggered so no matter what, if the enemy attacks, you're probably going to get caught in a cycle of stun-lock until the enemy decides to stop waling on you. Outside of combat, the world is beautiful and fun to explore and has a lot to do in it. Now, exploration is great and yet there's no sense of discovery because they added these two hyper annoying birds - an owl to guide you to a point of interest and a chocochic to guide you to rest stops. They'll hunt you down and harass you until you follow them so they rob you of any sense of discovery and interrupt whatever you're doing constantly by making certain you follow them or else. And the character work is top-notch but even that, too, is sullied by the WORST voice acting conceivable. Yuffie is intolerable, I want to strangle her. Chadley and his sister are untenable and they ramble and ramble on and on! And there are these two tertiary girls, a merc in a blue hat, and some Hot Topic reject that's WAY TOO into the card game. These two girls are infuriating to listen to. They neg you, the player, nonstop. They're spiteful, insidious, toxic characters that just drag down my enjoyment every time they're on screen. Why the devs decided to put in so many terrible, awful, negative characters is beyond me. I want to enjoy the game. Relax, feel good, have fun playing the game.

jpalvest,"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a great game. The open world is expensive and packed with a whole lot of activities. The story is also a high point of the game: the scenes are extremely well directed, regarding the VAs too, the visual effects, the dialogue... everything is really top notch here. The battle system has its own style - it's a good balance between the turn based system of the original FFVII and the action oriented battles of the modern Final Fantasy games. I'm now even more excited for the final part of this ambitious remake project! The graphics are good and the art design is impressive at times, but there are some caveats: some low resolution assets, problems with lighting, pop-ins... but nothing major I should say. I definitely recommend this game for any gamer, even more to those who love RPG!",10,2024-03-13,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Kenmei,"Rebirth is probably the most ambition game I've played in a long time, probably since Remake when it came out. The amount of love and care put into the game is outstanding and, just like Remake before it, you can tell the developers behind the game hold the original game in extreme reverence. There's so much to do and see here it's amazing, especially for those who know the original game really well. It was great seeing places like Junon Harbor and Cosmo Canyon in just amazing detail that it made some of the more tedious open world quests easier to do for me. While alot of people won't like that the open world segements are copy/pastes from other games, with a heavy Ubisoft vibe with some of them, the rewards do make the grind worth it, for me at least. And this kind of open world traversal does answer the question about Remake being way to linear ****. The story is also given alot of love and care, and continues Remakes ability to keep you guessing, even if there's not as many question marks that pop up this time for the future storyline. My one complaint, and the reason I'm not giving this a 10, is the ending. No spoilers but the thing they've clearly been building up to and they've been hinting at for 2 games worth of time, didn't hit the mark for me. While it's not exactly bad, it didn't live up to the hype as for what I was expecting. It feels confusing just to be confusing and to keep that element of guess work moving forward for the part 3 game later on down the line. I've seen alot of gaming news outlets be disappointed with it and, after seeing it myself, I can see why they would be not as impressed. That aside however, this is easily a game of the year candidate already, and one that I think might be difficult to beat. Especially with how crazy good 2023 was and with the lack of news about any big releases coming in 2024. I can safely recommend this to anyone who's played through Remake and wants more of just a high-quality game that was clearly given the love and attention needed to be a standout title coming off of a year of absolute bangers. While I have some major questions moving forward with the story, this is an easy no doubter to recommend in my mind.",9,2024-03-13,PLAYSTATION 5,user

DarkwingSchmuck,"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a beautiful, wonderful game from start to finish -- improving in almost every way upon its direct predecessor. This is, without question, the best Final Fantasy has been in over 20 years. By far. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth might be the second piece of a trilogy, but is almost a masterpiece on its own merits -- without the need of a part 1 or part 3. An already terrific combat system has been refined to great effect, and each character is both unique and a ton of fun to use in combat. The world is vast, and full of things to do. While there are some mini-games and such that aren't as much fun, the vast majority are a blast, and there is just so much variety that it's easy to overlook the weaker side activities. Side quests in general are a HUGE step up from not only Remake, but also the dreadful questing that was present in Final Fantasy XVI. Dungeon design in particular is tremendous -- with one major exception, the dungeons are all expertly put together. Again, a high point for the franchise showcased in decades. Furthermore, story and character here is at the highest level it's been in the franchise in equal measure. If there is anything holding it back from the full 10-out-of-10 (and it's about as close as one can get), it's with the fact that its ending is only as good as what comes next. It simply doesn't work without the full picture, as a lot is left wide open, and the core themes of ""defying the fate"" of the original 1997 classic which were established in its predecessor, Final Fantasy VII Remake, are here muddied. Remake tells us that we have a say in our future -- Rebirth, as of now, tells us that, actually, no we don't.",9,2024-03-12,PLAYSTATION 5,user
stinkyduck,"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a spectacular sequel to 2020’s Final Fantasy VII Remake, a remake of the original title from 1997. This second part of the original’s unforgettable story is lavishly reproduced with layers of heart, humor, drama, and tears. It somehow manages to mix the very best of roleplaying games, going on heroic and epic adventures with your found family/friends, with a best-in-class battle system and addictive mini-games. The size and scale of both the colorful and detailed world is remarkably bigger than Remake, and proves to me that the most lofty of dreams, of Final Fantasy airships and epic battles across the planet, are very feasible for the final of this remake trilogy. I cannot recommend this game enough for fans of role-playing games and action-RPG games alike. If you have been on the fence with JRPGs in general, FF7 Rebirth is a fantastic entry point, full of heart and emotion that is hard to come by in this genre quite like FF7. You will not be disappointed. It is absolutely a reason to get a PS5.",10,2024-03-12,PLAYSTATION 5,user
chrisstanley92,"To preface I platinumed remake I loved it, but this game? It's mostly padding, it's like FF7 made by Ubisoft and you know exactly what I mean by that, the traversal in the open world is very painful, designed to slow you down with gimmicky traversal mechanics, the content in the open world is also very dull aside from a few MMO level fetch quests, each zone in the game has the exact same objectives, which are: activate an AC style tower which populates the map with, boring combat challenges against low level mobs, or go here and do a scan this thing minigame, and this is the same set of objectives in every single zone bar none. The main plot is okay but it's very clearly padded out full of 'the princess is in the other tower' type of pacing. This is the second game of a trilogy and my boy does it feel like it, this instalment wasn't designed to go anywhere (think the Hobbit movies and you have it) and don't get me started on the minigames, this game is FULL of poorly designed minigames again more padding, and I mean picking mushrooms has a dedicated dual sense minigame (I'm not even joking) the main plot is around 30 hours long, to complete these mini games which comprise the bulk of the content? easily 100+ hours (that's where alot of the dev time went, and that's where alot of your money will go if you purchase this) I challenge you to find a single person online who's satisfied by this disparity you can easily skip this instalment and watch a recap video online save yourself the money.

Nelszack5,Rebirth has some of the most impressive moments ever put into a game during its main campaign but the second you leave and explore the open world the game drops from a 10/10 to around a 4/10 experience.

Trunks252,"Best Final Fantasy in 20 years. The story-telling, characters, gameplay, level design, all work together excellently to tell this story more fleshed out than ever before. I appreciate the new multiversal twist as well, as it keeps me guessing and invested. The combat is exactly what I want out of a modern Final Fantasy with action based gameplay; engaging fast-paced battles with just enough strategy to keep things interesting and prevent button mashing. The level design is significantly improved over Remake, with more open areas and backtracking. Easy to navigate maps and fast travel anywhere to reduce running around. The maps are large but dense, and not too big. Exploration is rewarding most of the time and the side quests are mostly entertaining. Unfortunately the game has some pretty glaring issues. The visuals are pretty disappointing from a technical side. Lighting and shadows can look especially bad. Performance mode is also fairly blurry at times, even on my 1080p screen. I can imagine it looks much worse on a 4k display. These issues, while disappointing, are ultimately forgivable and even possibly fixable with upcoming patches. My major issue with this game is the pacing. There are tons, and I mean tons of pointless mini games. A lot of these are required to advance the story, and it really takes me out of the world and ruins immersion. There are also issues with many pointless story beats, even entire chapters, taking up time for no reason. Thankfully that seems to be mostly contained within the first half of the game. I do appreciate conversation between the party members, as it serves to flesh out the story and world, but the game is at it's worst when it forces you to stop the story and play mini games. Overall I am loving my time with this game, but I just wish the devs had put that effort they wasted on mini games into actually creating more interesting content. 8/10",8,2024-03-12,PLAYSTATION 5,user
Caelus,"Despite my apprehension, due to disliking the padding, plot holes, and certain aspects of the gameplay in Remake, as well as the demo of Rebirth not selling it for me, I gave it a chance because my favourite FF hero, Zack, was back. Also, despite all of the understandable controversy regarding Remake's ending, I was still intrigued by where the story would go; along with the stellar reviews this recieved, I decided to give it a chance. That was a daft decision. First the pros: 1) Soundtrack. 2) Certain character moments. 3) Parts of the world are fun to explore. 4) Plethora of minigames available to play when you decide to, not when the game forces you to play them. 5) Introduction of some fun characters, such as Dio. Now the cons: 1) Paper thin plot. 2) Forced minigames. In many chapters you must complete minigames in order to progress the main story. These minigames are a nuisance, and add nothing to the plot. Of all of the things they changed from the original, this should have been at the top of the list. Just became obvious they wanted a long game but did not know how to achieve this. 3) They do nothing with Zack's story, you could remove most of it and the game would still be the same. Five minutes of his entire story matters in this game's plot, and going forwards. Cait, Dio, and Cid were more important than Zack in Rebirth. Why bring him back, and put him on the cover with Cloud, and Sephiroth if he is not vital in this game? It's in the same vein as calling these games a Remake of 7 when they're clearly not. 4) Far, far too much padding. This goes for story chapters, to side quests. This includes slow climbing sections, forced minigames, party being split up, penultimate chapter is 3 hours long, final boss fight has ten phases, the same dungeon is repeated in chapter 9 (first clear it with Cloud's group, then with Tifa's group), Cait's entire section in chapter 10, Yuffie's section in chapter 7, and so on. 5) Camera during combat. 6) First strike many times has made the character attack an enemy further from them rather than the enemy closest to them. 7) Open world clichés. Why does this get a pass but other games, such as Assassin's Creed, and Far Cry do not? No game should get a pass for open world clichés such as climbing a tower to unlock a portion of the map. 8) Open world does not feel lived in. Outside of towns, the open world has nothing to make it alive. They could've had characters talk to each other as they travel it, NPCs camping, NPCs hunting, fiends battling each other, weather changes, a day and night cycle, and more. 9) Many pointless boss fights. 10) A lack of a jump button, this was especially noticeable in combat against flying enemies. 11) Item use is still dependant on the ATB bars, despite there being only two bars. 12) ATB bars are slow to fill up. 13) Messy ending. 14) Tifa's treatment in the story. 15) Nonsensical story moments. 16) Whispers are further convoluted by a new story element. 17) Chadley. 18) The need to undertake a Chocobo minigame in almost every region just to get a chocobo! 19) Some regions of the open world are a pain to traverse due to how disconnected they can be. Particularly Gongaga. 20) Repetitive combat, and exploration (you do the same thing in every region to unlock more of the open world). 21) Side quests. Absolutely horrendous! 22) Cut areas that were available in the original by this point. 23) No Vincent or Cid in the party. They were in the original by this point. 24) Sephiroth's mystique, menace, and presence are totally gone. It was bad enough in Remake but this was worse. PlayStation hardly has iconic villains, but he was one of the few, now his reputation is heavily damaged. Uncharted, GoW, Ratchet and Clank, Horizon, Last of Us; how many of these games or other PS games have had a villain as iconic as Sephiroth, and that too for as long? Never played Mario or Zelda yet even I know of their villains. Like him or not, Sephiroth was like that, especially for the PS brand, and FF brand (as far as casual audiences go). Even before I'd ever played a FF game, I had seen the character in various gaming outlets. This game doesn't do his reputation justice, in fact it hurts it. That's it with the pros and cons. Basically this game felt more like DLC for Remake due to the shallow plot, little story progression, repetition, and padding (forced minigames above all else). Now as far as I am concerned, the last great FF game was 12, and it's a shame none have come close since (Type-0 wasn't too bad). It looks like this will most likely sell less than Remake, and maybe even 16. If that happens then I hope it gives the powers that be at Square the push they need to address the problems present in both this, and Remake, such as the padding problems, combat problems, and story issues. Hopefully if they do this, then perhaps the final part will mean this 7 'remake' trilogy was not a totally wasted endeavour.",4,2024-03-12,PLAYSTATION 5,user

roysom,"Wow, just wow. The hype for this game was too high for me to believe it would satisfy me, but it blew it out of the park and delivered on all fronts. This is literally a PS1 game (in terms of content) realized as a modern AAA game which lead me to investing well over 97 hours to complete (and I didn't even do everything). The scale of the world, the sheer amount of content, the quality of every side activity, no matter how small it is... This game does just about everything right. As a matter of fact, my biggest complain about it is that it has just too much to offer. Story (no spoilers): For the most part, not only did they do the original justice, they blew it out of the park. Many beats from the original were extended, the world building is amazing, and there are quite a few peaks, both joyful, moving, and sad. The characters are portrayed beautifully, both in acting and in writing. I loved every one of them (yes, including Yuffie & Cait Sith who are ENDEARING) and loved watching the relationships between them develop. My two biggest issues with the game are: - Some regions are REALLY hard to navigate (especially the 4th and 5th ones) due to some Chocobo mechanics that make pathfinding extremely difficult - Some dungeons are too long and absolutely overstay their welcome. For me, this is game of the decade. 9.5 from me, rounding up to 10.",10,2024-03-11,PLAYSTATION 5,user
Tacd,"Absolutely astonishing! FF7 Rebirth has outdone itself, raising the bar for RPGs to a whole new level. The immersive world, stunning visuals, and a soundtrack that just won't quit, it's a masterpiece through and through. The attention to detail is phenomenal, capturing every nuance of the original while injecting fresh, thrilling elements that keep you on the edge of your seat. The emotional depth of the characters is something else, pulling you into their journey, making every victory and setback deeply personal. The gameplay? Smooth, intuitive, and downright addictive. Whether you're a die-hard fan or a newcomer, this game is a must-play. It's not just a game; it's an experience that stays with you.

omnislack,"I'm about 47 hrs in. I am a huge FF7 fan and I hated Remake. it was too limiting. Progression and level design were too linear. Heck, you can't even choose your party members. Sure, Midgar was linear in the OG too, but if they were going to make a full game out of Midgar, might as well expand it in a way that's worthy of FF7. And the worst of all was the story. Some changes dumbed down the impact of some scenes, and a multiverse honestly doesn't fit the lore of FF7. I can talk more but that's enough about Remake. Rebirth fixes every complaint I've had in the first game (at least, gameplay-wise). I still don't like the multiverse thing but every part of the story that has nothing to do with the multiverse has been exceptional. The minigames are fun. The level and world design is actually amazing. I don't know how they did it, but they made the ""Ubisoft"" open world formula somehow fun, and if ever you're not into that, most of the open world fluff are optional. This is the best Final Fantasy I've played in more than a decade. Square Enix finally did it, a game that actually feels like Final Fantasy. I hope this wins GOTY.",9,2024-03-11,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Commonplayer,"I really like to recommend this game. I mean it has everything a AAA game should has. Enormous map, smooth and satisfy combat, a long story with many twists, unique song for each region, minigames for trophy hunter, a lot of character builds for RPG gamers, true aerial combat in an open world game, new character introduced,... BUT. There is a big big BUT here. Square Enix do everything the wrong way. I don't know what's happening to all the big gaming companies right now. But somehow AAA games are becoming worse. For the first 40 - 50 hours, the game is quite good. But after that the game becomes more and more frustrating. I feels like they just trying to make the game bigger and completely forget about the quality. Everything feels so empty and unnecessary long. I thinks my ingame time of just watching and doing some very slow stuff is about 20 hours long. A lot of bad scene make you walk really slow and the road was very long, some slow motion take way too long to finish,.. And above all, this game's graphic was bad, very bad with some degrade to ps3 graphic. The combat is the only thing i can recommend for this game. The mechanic is good with some crazy aerial combo. But don't hope too much cause this game aerial combat won't give you that much advantages. They are easy to execute but won't give you much satisfy. Square enix add perfect block and perfect parry which is very good. But again, is that a normal standard in every games with real time action? What else? Minigames is very bad, there is no skip mechanic and they force you to play every minigame. Some was ok like the queen's blood, chocobo racing,... but for the most they are all bad. Really waste your time to perfect each minigame. The music is the worst in gaming history. NO MUSIC IN SOME EPIC SCENE. I don't know why but they just let's us watch a very beautiful cut scence but no music, no enviromental sound. WHY SQUARE ENIX? WHY? This game is frustrated. I even feel frustrated for writing all the frustrating i had while complete this game. In total, FF7 rebirth is still a good game, but definitely not worth 70$.

FFVII Rebirth me provoca las mismas sensaciones que aquellos final fantasy de PS1 o PS2 de que estoy viviendo una aventura sin igual, repleta de personajes fascinantes y con una banda sonora que es capaz de emocionar en los momentos mas bonitos y épicos del juego, El combate es directamente no uno de los mejores de la saga sino de cualquier JRPG, espectacular y tan complicado como tu quieras hacerlo, si bien es cierto que no te hace falta dominarlo a no ser que hagas contenido secundario donde están las batallas mas complicadas y que necesitaran su propia estrategia como las de las invocaciones o algún jefe secreto. Después de 90 horas y haber hecho casi todo el contenido del titulo lo único de lo que me puedo quejar es de la repetición de ciertas actividades en el mundo abierto y de que aun falten seguramente unos 4 años para saber el desenlace de la historia de Cloud y todo su grupo.

And the mini games, please for the love of God, I didn't want a Ubisoft collect the entire map of solo Mario Party time wasters. Yes, I can skip most of that. Not all... and yes, skipping it means I also will be skipping the RPG grind, because I can't just do J-RPG stuff... Where are all the REAL side quests? Not MMO side quests...

YannySp101,"Final Fantasy VII is my favorite Final Fantasy game and the Remake was amazing, however, it was merely a prologue of a bigger narrative that took place in a linear world, and it couldn't show its true potential yet. With Final Fantasy VII Rebirth though, it finally did; featuring the middle act of Final Fantasy VII's story and an open world filled with content, this game is everything Final Fantasy VII fans dreamed ****, the story and the characters remain very faithful to the original game for the most part, however, Rebirth expanded on them in every way possible, and they absolutely nailed them. Unfortunately, I don't really like some of the new story additions to be honest, but at least they don't get in the way of the main story; in fact, the main story is even better than in the original game so **** for the open world, it has repetitive structure for sure, however, it's filled with surprises, rewards and content, and the towns are the most detailed I've ever seen in a **** gameplay has been improved upon in every way, from aerial combat to exploration, reworked movesets, mini-games, synergy skills, new limit breaks, better quest design, and more.Also, the visuals are gorgeous despite some blurry textures, and the music is just unbelievable; every single corner of the game has a banger in it, and the rearranged tracks are absolutely wonderful.Pros:+ Expanded story and characters+ Open world filled with content+ Excellent gameplay+ Breathtaking graphics+ Incredible musicCons:- Inconsistent writingNarrative: 8/10Gameplay: 10/10Content: 10/10Characters: 10/10Music: 10/10Graphics/Audio: 9/10Final Rating: 10/10- Masterpiece -Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a JRPG masterpiece that honors Final Fantasy VII's legacy to the fullest and marks the new ""Golden Age"" for the Final Fantasy series, 20 years later.With Rebirth, the Remake compilation is shaping up to be my new favorite installment in my favorite videogame series of all **** I recommend it?:Must-play for Final Fantasy VII fans.Newcomers should at least play the Remake prior to playing Rebirth.",10,2024-03-01,PLAYSTATION 5,user
Kotbu,"Overall a pretty poorly made game. Button mashy overly frenetic combat. Awkward open world navigating (jumping up and down obstacles looks like a high schooler animated it). Pretty cringey dialogue in a lot of spots. Majority of your gameplay is spent in rhythm mini games that appear to be intentionally designed to frustrate the player. Just an absolute shotgun blast of annoying button timing and awkward hand dexterity movements. Ive seen some people online defending the mini games and it blows my mind that people like this can exist. I dont know how we can have fallen so far as a species. Unless you are very obstinately playing final fantasy games for the brand name, you should probably skip this one.

Nuroglan,"Der erste Teil war schon eine Faszination für mich, vorallem als die Ankündigung mit dem Trailer kam. Der Hauptgrund ist definitiv die Nostalgie aber auch die Liebe zum Detail und die Energie, Schweiß, Tränen, Blut. Alles konnte ich im ersten Teil spüren. Nachdem ich die Nostalgie Brille abnahm, erkannte ich auch die Nachteile. Das Kampfssystem sah und sieht auch in dem Teil Super aus aber macht mir eigentlich kein Spaß ist mir zu überladen, kompliziert und ohne Erfolgserlebniss. Auch die Sidequests oder die Minigames usw. waren doch relativ lieblos bzw. belanglos und waren eher für das strecken der Spielzeit gedacht. So fühlte es sich zumindest an. Trotzdessen war es eine 7-8 von 10 für mich. ABEEER der Teil ist einfach nur ein Meisterwerk. Bis jetzt habe ich 40 Stunden Spielzeit und habe jegliche Nebenmissionen gemacht und diesmal hat sich fast jede Nebenmission gelohnt. Es gibt natürlich noch die Neben-neben Missionen xD die sind finde ich komplett unnötig und erinnern eher an Ubisoft Games. Das Kampfssystem macht durch die Synchrofähigkeiten bisschen mehr Spaß aber auch hier ist es eher das optische was geil ist und für mich mehr als genug den Zweck erfüllt. Die Welt ist einfach nur schön. Man erlebt jegliche Emotionen in intesivster Form und die Momente bleiben im Gedächtnis und im Herzen. Die Charaktere, Die Orte, die unglaublich gute Synchronstimmen, die obszön brutal uncensored geile Musik. Fast alle stimmt hier in dem Teil, außer paar Kleinigkeiten die für mich bei dem Gesamtbild nicht existieren. Für Leute die wie ich die Nostalgie Brille anhaben, werden zu 200% Spaß haben, außer ihr habt Final Fantasy damals nur wegen dem Kampfsystem geliebt aber ich finde beide unnötig und bin eher Fraktion Witcher xD.

nqa5qwe,"So much of a downgrade from Remake, did Ubisoft make this? When you are doing the actual story the music, characters and visuals are great. I like the relationships that build between your characters and am personally fond of some stupid campiness every now and then to break up the serious tone. It’s a shame however that the story only accounts for around 20% of the playtime. The rest of the time you are spent doing exceptionally dull fetch quests in an essentially empty open world where every single time you do anything the game stops to tell you that you’ve done something and if you’re lucky Chadley will call you to say nothing at you for 30 seconds. They added climbing into the game which is completely pointless and extremely slow. In an area where you are expected to spend tens of hours wandering around collecting things what you don’t need on top of that is encounters with enemies that are extremely annoying to fight. There are so many that are flying (which limits who can hit them), other stay underground and rely on you parrying them to get them up but then they don’t attack the player character like all other enemies do so you just spend 2 minutes waiting for them to attack you. That wouldn’t be so bad if it weren’t for the fact that the dull open world is substantially more fun than the no less than 30 minigames they have jammed in which are almost exclusively seem to have been added to make you hate the game as much as possible. Most of them are mandatory (to at least the lowest level) and with the exception of literally a couple of them they are equal parts janky, frustrating and poorly designed. Sure you don’t have to get a rank 1 score on them to continue the story (unless you want the platinum), gamers love getting the worst acceptable score on a minigame and moving on though right? Don't even get me started on the piano which is so intolerable that I had to write a python script to do it for me. The game forces specific party combinations on you quite often and offers no quick way to swap their materia over leaving you sitting on the “all equipped materia” screen manually swapping each and every piece of materia over, the 1997 original let you transfer all materia at once so going backwards there too. Even pressing buttons or pulling levers takes forever as you have to hold the controller button even though the character is not even trying to do anything they are literally just waiting until the hold is over and the pulling the level as normal. Overall the game just feels like a committee was put together to work out how they can make every single thing you do in the game take as long as humanly possible so they can take a 20h game and make it 100h. Runs like ass in graphics mode and to make performance mode not a blurry 480p mess you have to set your PS5 to 1440p and then rely on your TVs AI upscaler to make it look tolerable. You cant have a fast pace combat game and lock it at 30 fps, it just looks awful, motion blur can help hide it but this game doesn’t have that either. I’m still going to platinum it because I have platinumed the entirety of the Final Fantasy back catalogue but unlike the Remake which had frustrating moments but was for the most part a good time, after 40h so far in this game I’ve enjoyed maybe 5h at a push, I’m on chapter 9 and have heard it gets worse later in the game too so I look forward to doing that twice as hard mode is locked behind completing the game. In conclusion, I’m very disappointed, this game feels like work, I play it because I want to platinum it not because I’m enjoying it, I don’t look forward to playing it, I push through in the hopes that I get 30 minutes of good game at some point in my session. I'm starting to think I'm the problem these days when I see a flood of 10/10 reviews praising the exact things I hate and see as completely contrived padding. Are people googling a list of things that they are supposed to enjoy from game studios websites and then internalizing those or something? It feels absolutely baffling to me that any sane person could say this game is better than Remake. I stopped listening to official reviews a while back because they often deliberately ignore performance issues and bad things about the game, I've been burnt too many times. Now I cant even get an idea if the game is good from the general consensus of the people that play it as for the most part people don't seem to recognize bad game design even when its force fed to them.",4,2024-03-10,PLAYSTATION 5,user

The gameplay is top notch, the mini quests are great, the open world is great, and the writing for the smaller stories are fantastic; it is such a shame they couldn't get whoever wrote those stories to do the main plot.",8,2024-03-10,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Skyrimesm,オープンワールドRPGの最高傑作であり、この世のほとんどのRPGを凌駕するクオリティにただただ脱帽するばかり。 オリジナルのFFVIIすら凌いでいる。 コピペ1つすらない都市の建造物に内装、各オブジェクトの作り込みと、単に美しいグラフィックだけではない凄さがそこにある。 まるで自分が本当にそこに存在していて、クラウド達と共に旅をしているような感覚だ。 NPCに関してはスカイリムほどプレイヤーが干渉できるものではないが、その分状況によってNPC同士の会話に変化が見られるので彼らを観察しているだけでも飽きない。 それはちょっと物語が進行するだけでまるで変わる。 なので、一度訪れた町を再び訪れる楽しみすらあるのだ。 私はアクション性には興味がない。 最低限のアクションでシームレスに戦闘の臨場感を感じることができればそれでいい。 スカイリムくらいのアクション性で十分だ。 なのでここには敢えて触れない。 RPGとして非常にクオリティが高いことに驚愕したということだ。 主人公に人格のあるRPGは自由度が低い傾向があるが、FFVIIリバースは見事にこれを解決している。 フィールドの広大さや場所によってガラっと変わる風景の他にも豊富なサブクエストやゴールドソーサーでの息抜きなど、これら全てがJRPGである前に、RPGそのものであることを再認識させてくれる。 本当に素晴らしい。,8,2024-03-09,PLAYSTATION 5,user
moriya,"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a masterpiece that beautifully melds nostalgia with modernity. As a long-time fan of the original, I was skeptical about how a remake could live up to such a legendary title, but Square Enix has outdone themselves. The graphics are breathtaking, with environments so lush and detailed that they feel alive. Voice acting is top-notch, giving new depth to beloved **** combat system is a perfect blend of action and strategy, making battles thrilling yet cerebral. The addition of synergy skills and the revamped materia system add layers of depth to combat that were unimagined in the original. The storyline, while faithful to the source material, introduces new twists and deeper character development, making the journey feel fresh even to veterans of the original game.Exploring the world beyond Midgar has been an absolute joy. Each region is unique, filled with secrets and stories that enrich the overarching narrative. The game's pacing is excellent, balancing intense action sequences with quiet moments of character interaction and exploration.What sets Final Fantasy VII Rebirth apart is its ability to evoke a wide range of emotions. I've laughed, cried, and felt the thrill of adventure alongside Cloud and his companions. This game is not just a trip down memory lane; it's an entirely new experience that respects its roots while forging ahead into uncharted **** conclusion, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is not just a game; it's a monumental achievement in storytelling and game design. It's a journey worth taking, whether you're a fan of the original or new to the series. A solid 10/10 for me. best game i played in ps5",10,2024-03-09,PLAYSTATION 5,user

jl94,"Just wow. I know there is a lot of people out there upset that the story is different that the original game. Which I understand. But coming from someone who is rather new to these games.. I thought it was an incredible journey. I did play Remake and Rebirth back to back. Which I strongly believe helped me be attached to the story and characters a lot more. So my biggest recommendation is to play these games back to back or just to thave a strong understanding of the events in FF7 Remake. Truthfully, would of given it a 9.5 (but Metacritic doesn't allow for .5 points) as the performance isn't the greatest. But to me.. that really didn't take away at how good the game was. There was slight pacing issues but (without spoiling what the game filled these parts with) I ended up enjoying this ""side"" stuff the more I accepted what the devs were trying to offer us. All I can say was more options to have more fun in different ways instead of just always needing to fight things. (Tough to convey my thoughts on that without spoiling) But all and all.. if someone is considering embarking this FF7 Remake/Rebirth journey.. and are on the fence because some YouTube reviewers are upset about the story.. just tune that out and make your own decision. Don't let the internet tell you what to think. You might play it andend up agreeing with what they said (which is perfectly fine) but you might play it and realize you want to spend hours and hours in this world. Now I have to reconsider my hierarchy of games I've played. This fits somewhere at the top (I can already feel haters eyes roll back while reading this) But this was what I personally want out ****. Not a FF game.. just a game in general.",10,2024-03-09,PLAYSTATION 5,user

The combat is fantastic, the character development and world building is good, some of the minigames are awesome (chocobo racing, piano, queens blood are my favourites).

So many unnecessary stops and starts and hand-holding (world intel, CHAD, unnecessarily slow cutscene like sequences where you walk slowly and press L2/R2) as well as an overcomplicated story and way, way too many minigames. It just felt like a chore to get through.

I dont mind minigames when they're isolated from sidequests or mainquests- something you know you're going to do before you do it, but this game literally has over half of all sidequests, often with story elements and good gear, tied to some annoying, frustrating mini game. Why not do it like the Yakuza games where you KNOW when you're doing a mini game or not? Most of the combat revolves around fighting in the open world, few side quests, and main quests, and over half are some nonsense gimmicky mini game.

You are basically ticking off a checkbox just like Ubisoft games. Its run to this location to the next with no interesting things inbetween, with no interesting movement mechanic either. Everything you do while exploring is a puzzle, the very nature of exploring in this game is a puzzle, each zone after the other adds a new gimick that you need to use to progress through the zone like a puzzle in a level, its not exploration it ****.

Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is up there in a very prestigious tier of video games setting the absolute highest mark for their genre such as Elden Ring, Baldurs Gate 3, and now this game.

donte0000,神ゲー。 リメイクの時点でも素晴らしいゲームだったが、今作では更にパワーアップ。 戦闘はより複雑に面白くなり、アクションの占める割合が上がった。特にジャスガの実装などは素晴らしい。 また、たくさんのミニゲームは素晴らしいものが多く、冒険の息抜きとしてとても楽しめる。ただ数が多い分全てが面白いというわけではないし、人によって合う合わないはあるだろう。 探索についてだが、マップの広さや、オブジェクトが目に楽しいということなど、素晴らしい面も多いが、マッピングされない探索要素が非常に少なく、どのような報酬があるのだろうかというワクワク感を持って探索することが難しい。与えられる報酬が分かりきっているのは少し残念だ。また、高低差がある地形でどこから登れるかが定かではない、などの不便さもある。しかし総合的に見てとても楽しい体験であることは間違いない。 グラフィックについては言うことがないだろう。 ストーリーについては好みの分かれるところもあるだろうが、私にはとても素晴らしく思えた。大筋のストーリーだけではなく、道中での会話やサブクエストでの台詞回しがとても良くて、笑えたり、感動できたりとしっかりとこちらの感情を動かしてくれて一言たりとも聞き流すことはできなかった。 欠点がないわけではないが(というかそんなゲームは存在しない)、私が今までやってきた全てのゲームの中で最も素晴らしいゲームであると言える。満点。,10,2024-03-08,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Graphics are not a must if the gameplay is good, they are just a bit outdated such as tree assets look a bit cardboard, rivers and rock formations can look dull in areas. The art direction is very well put together making up for this. Overall loved FF7 and this is a big step up and less claustrophobic.

This game really doesn't have a lot of filler unless you consider optional content to be filler. I also think people are forgetting to apply the same scrutiny to the original game, because it had tons of backtracking that's been streamlined in Rebirth--that's the real filler. What about the various forms of padding from the original game? Didn't those arguably add flavor? So what's different about Rebirth? Nothing, really, but some people are salty with nostalgia. The retelling twists are even better than Remake and so is the combat. They added so much depth that it's kind of shocking how involved it can be in high level play. My main criticisms would be of Cid's character, though we don't get to see him near Shera and he's just an acquaintance to the party, so perhaps he'll loosen up in part 3; and Vincent uses his modern appearance which gives up a bit of organic storytelling. Still, they nailed it in other ways, like how he fumbles with technology like an old man.Going back to play it on hard mode just because it's that fun. Expect about 50 hours if you skip everything except the story, and 80 if you clear all the zones. If you wanna 100% the game with all the challenges, expect to double that. Also, big shoutout to this game for not having a piss easy final boss for once in the series.",10,2025-03-07,PC,user
Nebelritter666,"Info: ich habe das Spiel zuvor auch auf der PS5 gespielt! (Damals war ich von der Technik enttäuscht. Der Grafik Modus, war mir zu wenig flüssig und der FPS-Modus war Grafisch eine Katastrophe... milde Formuliert.) Jetzt das Spiel in all seiner Pracht auf PC zu zocken ist für mich als Fan des Originals einfach nur Wunderbar und Wunderschön. Hier und da hat es für mich noch seine Schwächen, wo man Potenzial liegen lassen hat. Aber im großen und ganzen ist es sowohl für Neueinsteiger der Serie und alte Hasen wie mich eine wahre Spieleperle!!! (Empfehle trotzdem zuerst zuerst Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade zu Spielen, um das ganze Ausmaß dieses Epos zu erfassen.) Volle deutsche Synchronisation gibt für mich sowieso nochmal Extra-Punkte!!! Wer ein Episches Story-Rollenspiel sucht, ist hier richtig! (An die Entwickler... ""Blut der Königin"", würde ich mir trotzdem noch stärker im Rampenlicht wünschen!) Mehr hab ich nicht zu sagen, wem das zu wenig ist kann gerne meine Rezension zu Final Fantasy VII Remake lesen, dass meiste was ich da gesagt habe, gilt auch hier! An alle die Final Fantasy lieben, sag ich hier mal liebe Grüße und habt Spaß!!!",10,2025-03-07,PC,user

Bmarrucci,"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, é uma obra que agrada muito em diversos aspectos. O jogo é divertido, porem sua narrativa da ênfase na construção dos laços entre os personagens. Pace - As vezes gera a sensação de que a história não cresce, até o final do jogo. (7/10) Direção - Jogo muito bonito, com cenas bem dirigidas, agradando fãs da velha guarda e novos. (9/10) Música - Simplesmente fantástico, como se esperado. (10/10) Narrativa - Ênfase nos personagens e seus laços.

onearmedgamer,"Everything that should no longer be done in an open world, Square Enix has managed to make a game of it Outdated mechanics that are 15 years old, an empty open world filled with ""?"" something that is systematically punished in any other game but here ""it's masterful"" the moments where you climb are magnificent, in Assassin's Creed in 2007 it was better done, here you have a smooth wall with big yellow wall hooks (if you're too stupid to understand) the passages in ""dungeons"" (closed levels) which are a horror to play, based on ladders to climb, carts to push, levers to pull, vacuuming (yes yes you heard correctly) and other joys which are only there to waste your time and make you say ""oh that dungeon was long (and filled with emptiness)""",4,2025-03-03,PC,user
KinimodYunmi,"Das Spiel ist richtig gut, aber ich hätte es von 80 Stunden auf 40 gesetzt, in dem man den Open World Kram weglässt. Es macht zwar manchmal Spaß, aber im Endeffekt macht man größtenteils immer dasselbe, nur in einem anderen Biom. Würde man nur die Story spielen lassen, hätte das einen wirklich gewaltigen Impact auf den Spieler. Die Open World Aufgaben haben mich eigentlich immer nur zwei Tage lang ausgebremst. Sie haben mir zwar manchmal Spaß gemacht, aber ich glaube es lag eher am Unterschied der benutzerfreundlichen Biome gegen die mit mühseliger Wegfindung wie zum Beispiel Gongaga. Vor allem der Einstieg ist sehr zäh und langweilig, bis es mit der Story endlich mal richtig los geht. Zudem kann ich nicht verstehen, dass ich nach Abschluss nur noch ein Kapitel laden kann und nicht einfach beim Wasserflugzeug am Dock in Costa ausgespuckt werde und die Welt auf den Stand vor dem Point of no Return gesetzt wird, um die Schatzsuche oder erstmal aufgeschobene Nebenquests abschließen zu **** Zwischensequenzen sind wirklich für das Kino, die deutsche Audio ist fantastisch und die Gesangseinlagen herzzerreißend gut, insgesamt ein Top-Game, hätte mit der Open World aber nicht so dermaßen in die Länge gezogen werden müssen.",9,2025-03-01,PC,user
aitorsibo,"FF7 Remake being among my favorite games, I had high expectations for Rebirth. The gameplay is an improvement over the first game, but it feels almost too similar. ""RPG"" progression and inventory are as awful as usual (learning weapon abilities through weapons that are just handed to you, materia that progresses at an abysmal rate, etc), I don't see the point in making any of these apart from trying to buy more time, which the game tries its hardest at. For every half an hour of main story, it will try to give you double that of half baked secondary content, with mission types like those you see in every single AAA game these days and lots of mini games. At first, I enjoyed playing these, but the game proceeds to fill every section with them and it gets tedious and repetitive. The open world is, well, everything you would expect, in the bad way. It's just bloat, completely unnecessary. Very early in the game, I decided I would skip everything I mentioned after giving it a try through clearing a whole area, which saved the game for me. Instead of wasting time, I just went through the main storyline like I had done in Remake. About gameplay, this game gets better over time, as you get access to more tools. I ask myself, is it okay to start in such a lackluster manner to get good at the very end? I'm sorry, but the game should be interesting gameplay wise from the start, it just takes too long to pick up the pace.About the story and characters, I liked it and I'm really attached to them. I like the lore and world, and the soundtrack is as good as is usual in Final Fantasy. I think it went a bit overboard with goofiness and childish behavior/mechanics/tips. It also makes abundant use of non-argumented plot twists and has many plot holes, which doesn't bother to cover. About the ending, well, SEPHIROTH! I'm sure you all read that with the track in your ears. It's the same old ending from remake. Characters defy fate, fight an ever-appearing sephiroth after going after him for the whole game, and he just flies away at the end. ""Don't worry cloud, we'll have yet another reunion in part 3, I'll throw you a meteorite and Aerith will be just fine"". It was just, expected. I honestly just went with the flow, but didn't feel nearly as impressed as in remake.Note: Bring Reno Back, also the main fight tracks carry fights so hard. Let's see how part 3 plays out.",8,2025-02-28,PC,user
vodas,"As the original FF7 is my favorite game of all time, this remake project could have went really badly in my eyes. But my oh my has SE delivered. These 2 games are everything I could have hoped for and more. Rebirth just radiates love to the franchise - it really feels like the devs had fun making this. The world is so well remade - I never expected the Planet to look so good and be so big. The characters are very likable and fun to play with throughout the whole game. And the music definitely deserved all these awards. The combat in my opinion is the definitive version of Final Fantasy combat - if it were up to me - all Final Fantasy games in the future would use this template. It is a perfect synthesis of more modern action and classic turn based actions/magic. The only wish I have for the 3rd part is for Chadley to take a bit more of a backseat in world exploration and rewards. I'm hoping for dungeons or more bosses which would give us powerful materia and rewards. The current model of getting them from Chadley is a bit underwhelming - so this would be a good change and more immersive for the world.",10,2025-02-28,PC,user

Chnmmr,"Great game and graphics, mostly fun combat and quests. Would be a 9/10 but I thought I bought ffvii rebirth not ffvii party minigame collection. So many minigames especially ones forced through story really pissed me off. 30+ minigames... enough is enough",7,2025-02-20,PC,user
Andante,"I have not finished it yet but this is so far a fantastic remake which improves a lot of things on the original. Main storyline is almost identical to the original with very small differences. Everything is bigger and fuller, for example Calm was just a very small town in the original, in the remake its ultra realistic with people interacting, partying lots of side quests etc. Mini games are surprisingly good, card game reminds me a bit of triple triad (FF8) which was in my opinion the best minigame of the series. Fighting system is the least favorite aspect of the game until now but I am trying to get used to it, it gets better the more you get used to it. Graphics are fantastic, big respect to the designers and 3d artists who remade lots of the original structures and models....everything looks fantastic. Music of the original is by definition a masterpiece, but the new tracks they added are very cool and energetic. Dialogues, characters etc. are fantastic. I honestly like rebirth up to this point more than FF7 Remake and the...original.",9,2025-02-09,PC,user
Dubeau,"Fun game. The story is interesting, but it lacked the emotion in the ending. The story was over complicated at the end, difficult to comprehend. It leaves place for a next instalment. Exploration is a blast. The intel was helping getting around the maps. The side quest were 50% interesting, many of them, devolve into mini game that were boring. That doesn't mean they were all bad, many of them are more then decent. The card game was certainly the most fun of the mini games. The music is still excellent, especially after chapter 9-10. You can upgrade your characters, your weapons with materia and such. You can create potions, but I did miss the food creation of FF15. Now, the bad: the game is badly optimize for PC. There is a lot of stuttering. They are fixing it, and the mods do help too. But read the recommendations carefully, this doesn't work well on Nvidia 10xx and some AMD cards. This part of the game demands a lots of tweaking, for my taste. I give the game 80%. Great game, but the conversion to PC leaves to be desire. No woke agenda, if you know those characters well, they still behave like the past, mostly.",8,2025-02-18,PC,user
Damastor,"Its a ""wow"" game. Beautiful, lovely story, loveable characters,excellent combat. Also I like that this game is not a short (i hate it when I have to pay 70 euros for a game which has 8-10 hrs main story. I beat the game under 50 hrs and only did the card game side quests.) The game runs smoothly, performance patches came in the past weeks, so would be unfare to downvote for this. Also, 90% of the sidequests and minigames are voluntary (I don't understand why people crying over the number of minigames, solution: don't do it, you still have 40 hrs of main quests. Although 1 thing I did hate is Chadley's constant phone harassment to do those side activities when you passing by somewhere).",9,2025-02-16,PC,user
Dee-Jay_Deli,"Objectively, this is ""just"" a really good game, despite some rough edges. You can argue that the open world design is a bit formulaic. You can argue it's poorly paced. You can argue there are too many mini-games. You can argue the story is fumbled by it's meta ambitions. And you'd be right.

infraRecon,"This game is in a Technically **** state with its PC Port, I have had 3+ Crashes, encountered a few Texture Loading/Failures on my Fast M.2 SSD, and Multiple Bugs that make the game just not work after an interaction which then forces me to restart my PC, and then there are Poorly optimized Settings. WTF is that DLSS Setting?! The game before NVIDIA Upgraded DLSS looked rough, and it runs pretty Hot too. I'm running this on my RTX 3060 which is more than enough to run this at 4K 60 with DLSS on. At 1080p, the performance scales **** the Bugs and the Crashes I have had with this game are insane, and it gets worse the longer you play. By the way, I've played 30+ Hours(I'm not finished with the Main Story because the story and quests are long, but I don't mind). Overall I'm enjoying the game but the performance optimisation is hurting my Experience. Square Enix Was complaining about why PS players are not buying their game and are not making money...This is why. Because the game doesn't want to work when it should. So since I've played for a while and I understand the basis of the game, its mechanics and its overall Experience, I'm going to give FF 7 Rebirth an 8/10. Even with the bugs and Crashes I'm still Playing, I'm addicted to it. It's not like GOW: Ragnarok where the game takes up 200GB, and the game's Story is OK. I like this game more than GOW: Ragnarok that's why it gets a Higher Score. And the Fact that the Game was actually Cheaper on Release makes it a little better. Square Knew the performance wasn't up to Code so they gave us a Discount. So the Big Question...Should you Buy FF Rebirth? Personally, if it's still on Sale, you have the Hardware, and You want to see the Next Chapter of FF7 Remake, then I would say yes it's an Ok **** I do recommend waiting about 3 months for the Performance to be sorted out, because even on the best Hardware the game will bug out or crash or something. Besides all that, there is no Trash DRM on release, and from what I've Played it is better than the First Game. It likes to show off a lot. The final Rating is an 8/10, Fix the Bugs Square Before I Get Angry. And the fact that you get to kind of go on a Date with Aerith makes me a Softy for this game therefore making this Review a tiny bit Biased. That's my Review, When You buy this game I hope you enjoy what I call Insanely Good Cringe.",8,2025-01-31,PC,user
Mikor,"Jako fan oryginalnej Final Fantasy VII którą grywałem za młodu ze słownikiem w ręku, utęsknieniem czekam na odnowione części tej wspaniałej przygody. Remake Intergrade było bardzo cudownym przeżyciem, połączenie nostalgicznych wspomnień za młodu z nowoczesnym idealnym usprawnieniem gry. Recenzencji mówi że Rebirth jest lepsze, więc jak dla mnie ocena byłaby 9/10 lub 10/10 ale... Mamy rok 2025 i dalej Square Enix ignoruje mnie i moich rodaków nie dając polskich napisów do gry (nie wymagam dubbingu) Więc za to odejmuję grze 6pkt Oczywiście to jest produkt firmy Square Enix i mają do tego ekonomiczne prawo, ale w Polsce jest grupa ludzi z Ogrodu Balamb którzy robią profesjonalne, pewnie lepsze niż Square by zrobiło bo fani tej serii gier, a do tego robią to całkowicie za darmo (odemnie dostaną wirtualna kawę) Niesety to potrwa ponad rok, ale wtedy kupię FFVII na jakiejś promocji i bądzcie wdzięczni Square za to że ktoś za Was leniwce wykonuję pracę! Do tego w roku 2025 brak obsługi monitorów ultrawide to już skandal nie regionalny jak z moją wersją językową gry, tylko już ogólno światową, za to minus 2 punkty. Na to też czeba poczekać aż fani wypuszczą łatkę fixultrawide bo leniwym Square nie chce się pracować. (Square Employee Version) As a fan of the original Final Fantasy VII, which I played with a dictionary in my youth, I eagerly await the remakes of this great adventure. The Intergrade remake was a very wonderful experience, combining the nostalgic memories of my youth with the modern perfection of the game. The review says that Rebirth is better, so for me the rating would be 9/10 or 10/10 but... It's 2025 and Square Enix is still ignoring me and my compatriots by not giving Polish subtitles to the game (I don't require dubbing) So for that I'm deducting 6 points from the game Of course, this is a Square Enix product and they have the economic right to do so, but in Poland there is a group of people from the Balamb Garden who make professional, probably better than Square would make because they are fans of this game series, and on top of that they do it completely for free (they will get virtual coffee from me) It will take over a year, but then I will buy FFVII on some promotion and be grateful to Square for doing the work for you lazybones! In addition, in 2025 the lack of support for ultrawide monitors is no longer a regional scandal like with my language version of the game, but already a global one, for that minus 2 points. For this we also have to wait until the fans release a fixultrawide patch because the lazy Square ones don't want to work.",2,2025-01-31,PC,user
