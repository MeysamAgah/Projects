pessoadoalem,"criticado por muitos por não ter vários finais diferentes como aconteceu em MASS EFFECT 2! Mass effect 3 é um jogo linear de pouca enrolação, e muita história. Se junte aos seus aliados dos jogos passados para combater a ameaça reaper que busca dizimar a galáxia, encontre raças alienígenas, explore diferentes planetas e faça a build que mais combina com o seu estilo de jogo, variando armas e poderes que podes usar. É um jogo bonito com uma história muito envolvente sim, e pra resolver um problema muito singular, ou um problema muito perigoso mesmo, é natural que hajam poucas soluções, e assim, há menos finais diferentes que o esperado, mas ainda eles seguem o tipo de atitude que o jogador tomara pra lidar com a solução. A jornada final de Commander Sheppard, meu primeiro Mass Effect q deixou o povo tiltado pq da pra carregar o Shepard dos outros jogos, e isso muda pouca coisa kkkkkkk",9,2025-01-21,PC,user
Blank1369,"Sadly.. One of my favorites series doesnt really end on a bang..Pros: -gameplay is improved and is fluid comparable to modern games -companions that you have met in the previous games will be here and you will decide the fates of them.. Some endings will make you cry :( -beautiful looking game Cons: -the ending. -the pacing is off at times when the tension is really high and the stakes keeps getting higher and higher the game dropped pace and went to a slice of life partying missions while it is nice but just jarring in my opinion -they couldve added way more companions from the previous games that actually joined the party.. Some of them are removed for weird reasons that i feel dont make sense, the roster in 2 is way better",6,2024-11-07,PC,user

NukeSanity,"Welcome to the worst ending in gaming history, where this game not only ruins its entire plotline, but the plots of the 2 previous amazing games too. It is also the first BioWare game showing signs of BioWare's growing decline. For example, player renegade choices have become much more tame. ME2 allowed you to side with Cerberus as a renegade, now Cerberus are hardcoded as the bad guys because they're indoctrinated. ME3 is still a great game overall and offers lots of entertainment value until the ending, but the cons will always be a stain on this otherwise completely perfect trilogy.",4,2024-11-01,PC,user
Ivko92,"Great send off. Gameplay is good, on level of the second part. Story was great even though the ending is underwhelming. I understand the sacrifice and that is fine story wise but the choices in the end does not make much sense. But cinematic pieces in the game were so good and combined so well with the gameplay that I can at least look past the flaws in the end. New squad mates are not interesting as the previous ones, not even Javik but the old ones still shine. Music and sound are good quite as well the voices of the characters. One of the best gaming series ever made.",9,2024-10-30,PC,user

TrueOptimist,"Another top notch sequel to end the epic space saga. While a lot of people have issues with the original ending I found it completely appropriate. Some how it once again approves on every aspects of the combat and story telling. It just feels really fluid and lots of fun to play. The multiplayer was also not something this series really needed, but completely welcome and a hell **** time that adds even more longevity.",10,2024-03-11,PC,user
OHMYHEAD,The best part of the best space odyssey. The official ending is a million times better than the fans ending. The official ending literally foreshadowed a method of interacting with the AI that scientists have only now figured out 10 years after the game's release,10,2024-01-01,PC,user
SergiusMagnus95,"ME3 at the moment, with 30h played is my favorite Mass Effect. Ive already played 1 and 2. 2 dissapointed me quite a bit, I dont understand all the praise it has, like me3 is lots of times better on all aspects. Ive rode lots of comments saying that the ending is crap and it may be. But as I said im having a blast with me3. And you get to see both ur babes Ashley and Miranda.

JustinForgueims,"Awesome game. The gameplay is almost perfect. Challenging combats, many options to face them. Many companions, elections and builds. All the scenarios are well done and unique. They removed the car/exploration sections that were so boring. Sprint duration was also fixed. Decoding minigames also removed. So only one annoying thing remains that's the artifacts exploration feature. There are lots of stories, side quests, companions quests, and most of them are fascinating and are driving bigger plot changes than ever. As usual in the franchise the dialogs are well written and interesting. There are still many dialog selections pointing to the same result or maybe not the expected one. The DLCs contribute with good stories and worth content. Historically many people complained about the overall story and specifically the endings. In my experience this 3rd chapter is the most epic of all, with the hardest and saddest decisions. And my ending, in my opinion, was a perfect conclusion for the saga.",9,2023-10-16,PC,user

Ciocolici,"""Mass Effect 3"" stands out as one of the finest games I've had the privilege to dive into, and it serves as an exceptional conclusion to the trilogy. In terms of gameplay, it truly shines as the pinnacle of the series thus far. It's a package that feels complete, leaving me hard-pressed to find anything I'd want to alter. The seamless progression of the story, the intricate decisions that shape the narrative, the electrifying moments that get the heart racing, and the remarkable depth of the characters – all of these aspects are masterfully executed. While I'm well aware of the backlash the ending faced within the fanbase, I must say I don't share that sentiment. Personally, I found no issues with it. Instead, I found the ending enjoyable and genuinely satisfying. The legacy of Mass Effect is undeniable; it has firmly established itself as one of the standout video game series. This adventure was, is, and will forever remain among the best in the gaming world.",10,2023-08-20,PC,user

HydrophobikFish,"Mass Effect 3 is a good game, but ultimately a disappointing capstone to a stellar trilogy. It's high points are among the highest of any in Bioware's catalogue, but there are so many narrative problems surrounding them. Bioware couldn't make key friends too relevant to the game because they may be dead from the prior game, leaving many of the games most emotionally engaging stories a little listless. It has incredible peaks in its writing and incredible valleys, and has largely lost track of the original themes of the first game. It does boast some high quality combat mechanics that really shine in the weirdly high quality multiplayer mode. Overall a mediocre game elevated by its older siblings.",7,2023-06-09,PC,user
HyperLAW,"Mass Effect 3 is the top game of the ascending trilogy. The game was so good, so touching that the subjects of the critics we mostly see people online complain about are just crap and coming from crying baby gamers, not real gamers.

AJCk19,"For something that was supposed to be far more advance than the 1st two games. It retro acted a lot of the story and didn't live up to a lot of marketing promises. However, the team did try to fix some of their mistakes through dlc. Gameplay was great, but the long term investment into the story didn't pay off. So a 5 star out of 10 (half for half) seems fair to me. Although, devs did try to come back and fix the story. I'll give it +1.5 more star on top of that. Metacritic doesn't allow half points, so a 6 it is.",6,2023-05-06,PC,user

Arcee7321,"A very good game, it is only a little worse than Mass Effect 2. People are just review bombing this because they cry about the ending. Great story (and yes, I am not a fan of the ending too, it's decent, but that doesn't mean I am going to rate this game a 0 just because of the ending). Mass Effect never fails with this one. Great DLCs, Citadel is just a masterpiece, there is no other game with DLC like Citadel. Other works well too. Combat is just as fine as ME2. Graphics are a little better than ME2, but remember those games are only 2 years apart, it was not a huge difference like other games that are 5+ years apart.

Не имей эта игра в названии приставку Mass Effect, то и оценка была бы выше. Но первые 2 части задали поистине космическую планку, достигнуть которую не могут спустя даже 10 лет.

Advantages: + Characters is still amazing, you can romance most of the characters and the love lines are pretty well written. + Choices and their consequences from all ME series + Music is gold + Design and locations good tho Disadvantages: - Final RGB mission (I won't spoil it, but the ending is potboiler) - Lack of navigation for secondary tasks (almost all this tasks have to be googled) - Gameplay has become more clumsy than ME2",8,2023-01-20,PC,user

TastieToasty,"War is depressing. The feel of the game is completly diffrent compared to the other games. FOV is embarrasing You cant Holster your weapons anymore it feels more like a big Cod Campaign and not a true Roleplaygame. and your decisions didnt really matter from ME2. the DLC's are also terrible, the omega dlc was boring and long. I thought you could visit it again but nope you cant. the citadel is also really small compared and there arent any mayor areas where you can walk like in ME2. as I said it really feels like a big COD campaing and not like a RPG anymore, the holstering is also a big issue for me in this regards. Mass effect 5 is in development, it will even have old characters like Liara. Oh God, I am really worried because the REAL Bioware is GONE. only the name and legacy remains.",7,2022-11-02,PC,user
IronWolfFang,"I do love this game, there are some brilliant moments. For example, the use of the song 'Leaving Earth' gives me chills to this day. One thing I would note is that playing the other two games in the series makes the game so much fun as you can meet all of your past friends and I think thats how it should be played. Ending was meh to be honest but its hard to compete with mass effect twos beginning and end.",8,2022-09-30,PC,user
ryeli,This game is the weakest of the trilogy. I wouldn't recommend playing it unless you are absolutely in love with the characters. The plot is weak and the writing is boring. The intro was very strong and had me ready for a compelling story but it immediately falls off and stays off. The gameplay loop is repetitive with the only interesting changes being that you might get in a turret at some point. I have to give it props for being the most cinematic entry in the trilogy but it doesn't make up for the rest of it's shortcomings. A huge disappointment.,0,2022-09-12,PC,user
Hochbichler,"Mass Effect 3 is the third installment of the legendary Mass Effect sci-fi action RPG game series, released in 2012 it also concludes the Mass Effect Shepherd trilogy. In Mass Effect 3, I got the feeling that everything is smooth and polished when compared to its predecessors. Well everything except the ending obviously. But otherwise I really enjoyed this game, the missions are more plentiful, more diverse, more interesting, the interactions and relationships with your squadmates are as great as they always were. The story itself is pretty predictable but individual missions are very interesting with important choices to be made. Graphics is similar to ME2, but still very nice, polished and likeable. Game font is also pleasing to the eye. Music is nonintrusive and well chosen (Bad Choices). The range of story choices is maybe a little bit more limited than in ME2, but it still offers a great variability. The only trouble with this game is the ending. Upon the game release back in 2012, the ending was just a joke and even with two DLCs and a lot of fixing and polishing, it is still mediocre and unmemorable, specially for a great trilogy like Mass Effect. Such a trilogy deserved better. It is a pity that there is no peaceful path when dealing with Cerberus, it just seems maybe a little bit too extreme for Shepherd to switch like that and really hate Cerberus in ME3. Also maybe the events between ME1 / ME2 and also ME2 / ME3 could have been explained in more details. But these are minor and mostly personal problems. It is worth noting that this trilogy is really supposed to be played as such and jumping straight into ME3 without a previous save from ME2 and knowledge of the events of the previous games would be inadvisable. Microtransactions are present in the mild form of overpriced DLCs. SJW nonsense is maybe a tiny bit more apparent than in the previous games, but still nothing major. DLCs: Leviathan - The first true story DLC released for ME3. It is well written, with dark atmosphere and a few surprises along the way. This DLC is very important for the main story of ME3 and indeed the whole trilogy, so much so, that this should have absolutely been part of the base game and not a DLC. Otherwise worthy story DLC. Verdict: 70% Omega - The second story DLC for ME3. It takes you back to Omega, which you no doubt know and love from ME2. Its a classic optional story DLC with very little ties to the main story. This time you cannot take any squadmates with you and instead you play with Aria and her ""friend"". Omega is fun and the only real downside is the price. Its about three times as much as I would consider appropriate. Verdict: 75% Citadel - The third and last story DLC for ME3. This time the developers decided to do something different and allowed Shepherd and his crew to take a break from fighting the reapers and relax. Well mostly. I would separate this DLC into three parts. The first one is the story itself, which takes you around the Citadel and forces you to fight your own clone. The second part is the Silversun strip, which is basically a mall with a bar, a casino, an arcade and an arena. All these are fun to play with plus you can find your friends on the strip and spend some quality and fun time with them. The last part is a big party that you can throw in your new apartment. This whole DLC is definitely leaning towards comedy and it is filled with jokes and puns. It fits very well towards the end of ME3 and the entire trilogy and the developers really made the best out of all the relationships you built during your playthrough. It really works for Citadel and it makes you feel almost nostalgic. The price is more appropriate for this DLC than for Omega, but still a little too much for my taste. All in all a great DLC. Final verdict: 92 % I personally enjoyed Mass Effect 3 very much, the meh ending did not spoil nor diminish the hundreds of hours of great fun I had playing this fantastic trilogy. The journey is, after all, the destination. Final Verdict: 94 %",9,2022-09-07,PC,user

Nekrips,"The final part of the legendary trilogy. In my opinion, it absorbed the good qualities of the previous two parts and added some of its own innovations. The plot in this part has become the most epic and large-scale in the entire trilogy. All your decisions made in the previous parts will affect the overall course of the story. Although the ending rightfully raised a lot of questions for many, the story itself and its development throughout the trilogy are the best in the history of games. The plot captivates you from the very beginning, and excellent DLCs will help to better reveal the full depth of the story. The gameplay has not changed much. The combat system is also top-notch. Graphically, the game has received some improvements. The music in this part is the best of the entire trilogy. The perfect conclusion to the legendary trilogy, despite the controversial ending.",10,2022-08-12,PC,user

For me the ending really came together for me and really summed up the previous two games meanings. It felt like the end of 7th gen for me.,10,2022-05-09,PC,user

kyle20ellis,"Greetings from Lithuania. ""Mass Effect 3"" (2012) is a superb game for everyone who enjoyed the previous two installments. Maybe it is not as addictive as Mass Effect 2, but it is a superb game in every direction, with amazing story, great game play, great RPG elements ant etc. There are some issues with controls in close combat, but those are mind issues in comparison to a whole view - a SCI epic on biggest proportions. I do loved the original ending, never played alternative one. Overall, ""Mass Effect 3"" is a great game and a great conclusion of a saga.

E un solo crash se guardi in un certo punto nella missione su Sanctuary c'è una porta e se ci passi guardando tipo verso destra crasha il gioco.

Ltom,"Mass Effect 3 is a mess of overdesign and copying from other games it has no job copying from. For clarities sake, I played this game right after I finished Mass Effect 1 and 2. And I got to say, it is by far the weakest Mass Effect game I've played. Playing this game feels like seeing a good friend go down a depression spiral, it's unfocused, it's pacing is trash, character's personalities are changed to make this whole game feel more like gears of war and the expendables, instead of what Mass Effect was. It's not all bad of course, it does have it's moments, like any other game does. And it is a really good experience when it wants to be. The problem is, it doesn't want to be good often. The new characters are also painfully bad, such as james who I wish I could let die from the first mission. Or cortez who is a semi replacement for joker, only worse and way more annoying than he has any right to be (but he can die on the final mission so that gave me a smile at least). When Mass Effect 3 is good is when it is actually Mass Effect. When you hang around with Garrus, Tali, Liara. You know, the usual suspects, and have fun. It does happen a lot and before playing the casino DLC party ending, I was going to give this game a 1 or 0 out of 10. But I have to admit that, no matter how disappointed I am in this game, and no matter how much I disliked most of the game. It does have those moments that put a smile on your face and a tear in your eye. So, for that alone I'll give it a 4. I don't think it worth more than that and I will get into it later. For now, let's focus on the pros and cons. Pros: Biotics have nicer effects and some biotics that used to not have much impact in the game now feel a lot better. Gunplay is arguably better. Cons: The characters introduced in the third game are borderline horrendous, with the exception of traynor. Other than that, they are either forgettable or asinine. The pacing of the story is way off, it tries to give this sense of urgency that is destroyed the moment you stop to find cables for some random schmuck Old characters you know and love turn into action movie protagonist level of dumb and annoying sometimes. Something that's fine for the new ones (since that's what they are supposed to be I guess), but not for the older ones who where never like that. Shepard feels weird when compared to other games of the series. He feels disconnected and turns into a military **** only to make a 180 in the final mission. Which leads me to believe that there was some push from EA to make him like that. But I wouldn't know and assuming gets us nowhere (nor does it change the fact). Side missions and companions feel ""weaker"" than in previous titles (not combat wise, story wise). That's for the big ones, in my opinion. I could go on about how the gameplay feels clunky and a bad ripoff from gears of war, or how the game forces you to interact with characters you don't want to, or how everybody talks too much all the **** time. ""Oh, here's a ladder, oh here's the door) it's like a constant tutorial. A constant tutorials I didn't and for and don't want. Or how military mumbo jumbo makes every dialogue feel stupid and annoying and how there are less than half dialogue options, compared to ME2. But, I digress. The main problem with ME3 is that it trying to be something it's not. It's trying to be gears of war and the expendables, when it should have just be something more akin to band of brothers. And it works when it is more like it, that's the frustrating part, they know how to make the game good and just didn't. The voice acting is a toss frankly, some voice acting is amazing and some is trash with everything in between. The ending is something that will divide opinions a lot. As a starters, I love bitter endings. I like it when the ending puts a tear in my eye, when someone isn't making it back this time. The last hurrah! If you will. So the ending isn't something I completely dislikes and there is some amazing award worthy voice acting in the final mission in my opinion. But that is not enough to carry this one home I'm afraid. For context. I 100% this game in 35 hours (roughly 3-4 I was afk but just go with it) and for 20-24 of them I was out of my mind, pissed off with how they treated the old characters and the fact that I had to interact with the new, annoying, boring, pieces of **** they put in the story. I got the """"""good"""""" ending with 8000 military strength points (you don't need that much you need 7400 I believe) and I would be lying if I said that I didn't like doing any of it. Or that I wasn't sentimental in the final mission. But it's just not enough. So, I can't in good faith recommend this game. If you want to play it for the trilogy, do it. However, be prepared to be disappointed a lot of times. That's that... Hopefully the new one will be better though I wouldn't hold my breath. Oh, one last thing.

Broyax,"Mass Effect et son univers éveillent une affection particulière : après tout le héros Shepard porte le nom (hasard ou coïncidence ?) du premier Américain lancé dans l’espace, un type éclipsé par ceux qui sont allés sur la lune… Et quand on a un vaisseau beau comme le Concorde (un Concorde de l’espace) et qui s’appelle en plus « Normandy » comme notre feu vaisseau Normandie, ça sent bon le camembert tout ça (et j’adore toujours un bon calendos fabriqué… en Normandie). Troisième fois que je le termine (après deux fois sur 360) et l’interface de la version PC est à mi-chemin entre celle du premier Mass Effect (très bien pensée) et celle du deux. Toujours pas de manette mais un jour peut-être, ils comprendront chez Bioware, qui sait… c’est parce qu’ils préfèrent les consoles et ma foi, je les comprends un peu quelque part. Toujours est-il que le bond graphique est très sensible depuis Mass Effect 2 : le moteur Unreal est parfaitement maîtrisé et ça tourne tout à fond à 60 im/s. Pas mal pour un jeu du début 2012. Quelle conclusion en tout cas que ce Mass Effect 3 : passionnante, grandiose, épique ! cette remarque ne concerne pas la toute fin elle-même… mais je vais y revenir. A la narration parfaitement orchestrée s’ajoutent des combats décidément parfaits (et encore plus tactiques) une ambiance sonore au sommet, une musique (toujours électro en majorité) réussie, une mise en scène stupéfiante et un doublage français impeccable. J’ai essayé le mode multi-joueur qui fait malgré toutes les tentatives de Bioware, très pièce rapportée mais qui remplit son office de passe-temps vaguement divertissant et parfaitement inutile dans un jeu de rôle… et très optionnelle heureusement. Reste que s’appliquer sur cet aspect a eu un effet positif sur la maniabilité excellente durant les combats -on dit ça bien sûr pour se rassurer, tout ce temps passé sur le multi ne l’a pas été sur le solo… Et à cet égard, la fin aurait mérité davantage d’attention… car si la fin étendue -ou enrichie- précise quelques points qui restaient flous ou sujets à l’interprétation, elle n’en demeure pas moins…. toujours décevante ! ou plutôt devrais-je dire les fins, lequelles ne tiennent de toute façon pas debout, quel que soit le bout par lequel on les prenne. En tous les cas, malgré cet écueil (des fins merdiques) quelle joie de finir (et refinir) cette trilogie avec le même personnage et toutes les décisions que l’on a pu prendre et d’en voir les effets se perpétuer en cascade d’un épisode à l’autre ! on ne s’en lasse pas et c’est toujours la nostalgie qui vous prend les tripes lorsqu’on se remémore les personnages, les batailles et les décisions de Mass Effect 3 !",9,2021-06-08,PC,user

SuperkenGaming,"Mass Effect 3 Legendary Edition Go google pictures of Mirandas butt Mass Effect 3 is the final chapter of Sheards story youre off to end the reapers, this race of beings that threaten the existence of the universe as you know it… I didn’t play the original version, but here in Mass Effect 3 you have the option to play RPG style or action style… as someone that played the last 2 games I love the choice aspect of this series so I chose to mainline the story with the rpg elements here.. choosing my dialog.. unfortunately though the game doesn’t make it hard for you to just b line to the end in about 12 hours. Why? Because this just ist the least interesting game in the trilogy.. it just is.. you already know which charcters you like in this universe.. and there aren’t really anymore to fall in love with before the big showfdown.. so I just didn’t care to do the side missions, especially with just how repetitive the main campaign felt.. why would i? I had no insentive to explore and go do more.. that being said mass Efect 3 is decently enjoyable to play through.. You will get more squadmembers as the story goes on, youll be picking out their special abilities, and they do become an important part of your arsenal.. for example Liara was a stple for me to deal with annoying shielded enemies, I loved how on command I could have her just throw any enmy in the eir right in front of me.. so it really is up to you to baance your squad of 3 to your play style.. I do wish however there was more information given to me before a mission s maybe I was more throughful about the 2nd member… if I ever had anyone different it was mostly because the tory forced it on me.. in general mass effect 3 does an awful job at pre gaming… you have to chose your loadout before you go in.. having no idea what youll be dealing with ahead of time.. it makes literally 0 sense for me to not change my loadout based on my current situation on the fly… it ultimately lead to me not relly trying out any guns after I had one I was pretty satisfied… If mass Effect 3 werent the bow ontop of a series I had to see the end of after a huge investment into 1 and 2… I probably wouldn’t have been so invested to see it through.. it lies on the shoulders of the success of the perevious games and sadly doesn’t live up to the world building standards they set… While I did enjoy going through this campaign and putting an end to this intergalactic war… by itself, mass effect 3 isnt all that great.

Antictra,"9 years after: I played the game just when it was released in march 2012, had a part in the ""ending war"" with EA and Bioware, replayed game again anno domini 2021 under covid curfews. My vision did not change that much since 2012: Mass Effect 3 was a magnificent ride as it followed and given a closure to so many emotional story arcs, just like a flawless ""Rachnia sound symphony"" just up to the last 5 minutes of the game spoiled and corrupted by the ""reapers"". Whoever they were, they were severely punished back in 2012 and then again for Anthem occasion. The inconsistent pacing of the very ending with the rest of game is still there and will remain forever, even though certain mods give the possibility to somehow limit it's ""cliffhanger feeling"". I would describe it as solipsistic, not because of the sense of its' different variants but because of its delivery, completely out of place and logic of the rest of the game. Beyond that ME3 has the very nice flow both in gameplay mechanics and storytelling, while giving a certain liberty of action, influence on the events and characters in that vibrant, fascinating world. Stylistically original it will remain for a long time in the minds and hearts of the players. Clearly I recommend to play the game for itself, while being prepared for not satisfying ending. Remaining and recurrent problem with EA's game is its intrusive DRM and selling the 9 years old bare game with no DLC. Now they plan their new legendary edition, yet, while it may be interesting for new players, for old ones it risks to be an expensive acquisition (and still with intrusive DRM).",8,2021-03-07,PC,user

19magathann,"Would've gotten a 10 if not for the horrendous tactic of Galactic Readiness that forces the player to play an inoffensively passable multiplayer experience that drags on for over 10 hours, then regresses at far too fast of a rate in order to ""encourage"" the player to buy microtransactions. The general plot of the game is fantastic up until the final 30 minutes, but I've forgiven this egregious error since BioWare remade the ending in order to fix up the blatant plot holes. I also hate the idea of taking out crucial story elements such as ""Awakening"" and ""Leviathan"" and selling them as Day 1 DLC, a tactic still used by AAA developers and publishers in order to promote Season Passes. It's a scumbag move to nickel and dime your fans out of the full experience. Stop it, EA. While my first and third point mostly have to do with EA being greedy, the parts of the game that BioWare was responsible for are the gold standard of gaming. If there was more time for BioWare to create the game they envisioned, maybe the game would've been better received by everyone, and it is generally a damn shame that the ending of the game is so talked about, it obscures every other strength and weakness the game has. Since I've already talked about it's weaknesses, let's talk about it's strengths. In spite of losing the main writer for the last two games, every story and character plot is satisfactorily concluded in some way or another. Depending on how you played Mass Effect 2, you can either rekindle relationships with your friends or visit new (and admittedly more dull) characters that fulfill the same role. Every side plot has a firm conclusion to it that still has dire consequences based on the choices you make, and the combat is unmatched in my opinion. Even more enemies than before, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, power weapons strategically placed to turn the tide of battle, squad controls that make the game so satisfying to play even 8 years later, and even though the spacebar is overutilized for movement, the movement itself it drastically improved from the clunky and slow paced movement in Mass Effect 2 and 1. This game is excellent if you removed the final 30 minutes, and deep down, you know it's true, too. I'll be the first to criticize BioWare for their egregious mishandling of the ending, their refusal to address the ending to anyone, and even how they botched Andromeda beyond repair, but at the source, this is EA's fault for rushing the game and being greedy pigs. 9/10; excellent game.",9,2020-09-28,PC,user

JamesDrawsThngs,"Mass Effect 3 is the concluding chapter in the Commander Shepard trilogy and one of the most controversial games of the past decade. The amount of disappointment and anger that this game managed to generate is immeasurable. This, along with the disappointing Dragon Age 2, **** away every ounce of good will that Bioware generated. Almost a decade has passed since ME3's release, and its sting can still be felt today. ME3 is a game that has sadly gotten worse over time. However, I do not believe this is a bad game. Far from it. The Reapers have successfully invaded the galaxy, and now Shepard has to do their part to unite the different races together in an effort to stop the Reapers, all the while building the ultimate Deus Ex Machina known as The Crucible that could possibly be used to stop them for good. The quality of the storytelling is very sporadic. One moment I'm face-palming at how moronic and out-of-character someone is, or how contrived, awkward or force another moment can be, but then be greeted with moments of pure awesomeness, spectacle, or just plain heart-warming. However, what this game is most infamous for lies within its conclusion. In its original state, the endings truly are awful. No question about it. All of the choices you've made, the characters you've grown to love, the alliances you have built. All of that gets practically wasted by the final """"decisions"""" Shepard is forced to choose from. If you invested your time and energy into this series for the five years it had been going on up to that point, absolutely you would feel demoralized by this moment. Bioware did attempt to remedy this a bit with the release of an Extended Cut that was meant to add further closure and explanations for certain details (all the while creating new questions that shouldn't be there). It certainly was a much needed patch job, but that's all it was. It still didn't fully fix the issues that the game's conclusion suffered from, and it will forever be remembered for that. While there are still plenty of big choices to be made throughout the game, most of them are within the context of the previous two games, rather than ones made for this game exclusively. Gameplay has received both improvements and detriments. Out of the original trilogy, I definitely think that this has the best combat. The movement options feel more refined, the levels are a little more open-ended, organic and less ""video-gamey"", the gunplay feels ultra satisfying and the weapon upgrade system adds an extra layer of depth. They also managed to find a strong compromise with the level up system. It's not as in-depth as ME1, but not nearly as stripped down as ME2. The probing mini-game is now just a simple ""find dot on the map and poke it"" and snag the item. The game also benefits from some great looking environments and some of the best voice acting in the series. The gameplay detriments, though, are pretty egregious. Firstly, the sidequest structure in this game is terrible. You get most of your sidequests by just eavesdropping on peoples' incredibly private conversations, then you go out on the galaxy map, find the thing and bring it back. If that sounds tedious to you, you'll be *happy* to know that the codex does NOT keep track of mission completion! If you get sidetracked in the middle of a mission, or just put the game down for a while and forget about it, you are not going to know how far along you are unless you retrace your steps to make sure you got everything. You would need to do a sidequest on its own to completion with no distractions just to make sure you do it right. Hell, a few of the quests don't even bother telling you the location of a planet, and unless you look up a guide you're gonna have to scour the entire galaxy just to find the damn thing. That is bad game design. The dialogue wheel also reduces your choices between paragon and renegade, with no in-between. The war asset system, while neat in concept, is poorly executed and, unless you have the EC and story DLCs, all but force you to engage in multiplayer if you want to achieve the best possible outcome. The best way to describe ME3 would be ""sporadic"". It shifts back and forth between stupidity and brilliance, fun and tedium. I still honestly believe it's a solid game, in spite of its faults, but I don't blame anyone for being soured by it.",7,2020-07-31,PC,user

Still, the ending was very satisfying to me with plenty of action and drama!",9,2020-04-26,PC,user

dlcwolf,"It complete very well the Trilogy and is a must follow after Mass Effect 2. It is very similar to the Mass Effect 2, it recovers the engine, the scenography (the Normandy is practically the same, with some modifications and new rooms). I would name this as Mass Effect 2.5. But there are overall improvements and, of course, a new story that goes on and conclude the epic story. I am not against the ending, it is an end and you have also opportunity to have some different ends. To some can like it, to some one else not. It is a end. But for the great universe, the plot, the love story (i loved the one with Liara that i followed from the first chapter), let me feel really the emotions as a great movie/book/story should do. For this, i put a 10, for the overall trilogy, the great universe and experience of game. As i said, is not so different as gameplay and graphic from the 2, but anyway, all the story is a must to know/play for everyone that likes the Sci-Fi. I will not forget this.",10,2020-03-21,PC,user

Gearetic,"I've recently taken it upon myself to replay through the entire trilogy back to back and I suppose I have to be the one to say it: Mass Effect 3 is not a bad game. Shocking, I know. The user review score would have you believe this is some sort of failure but you have to understand the context of these reviews, especially now, years after release when everything has settled. Mass Effect 3 was the very first sign of EA's descent into madness that Bioware unfortunately got caught up in. This is the first single player game that featured the now notorious micro-transaction system we all despise. These monetization methods and publisher meddling have proven to be game killers, and Mass Effect 3 was the first warning we got. Couple that with an unfortunate handling of the game's ending sequence that resulted in the outrage and barrage of negative reviews you now see before you. With all that said, I can now begin to explain why this game is actually fantastic and still worth your time. VIsuals: The visuals in ME3 are a significant upgrade to the previous entries. Although it definitely is not ahead of it's time in any way, we have to remember that ME1 came out in 2007 and somehow looked worse than a lot of games from 2 years prior. This is a third person RPG, meaning that it is not beholden to the standards of a linear FPS, let's say. Even so, the visuals in ME3 somehow manage not to look particularly dated even close to 2020. That said, there are still some issues that permeate throughout the entire trilogy. The animations tend to look very stiff and awkward a lot of the time and the facial animations leave a lot to be desired. In fact, I can't say the quality of the animations changed much at all since the first game, leaving most of the characters looking pretty deadpan even in an RPG that is 80% all about character interactions. Another issue are all the character models besides the important, handcrafted ones. All the ME games have used the same shoddy system of generating side characters that ends up making human NPC's look laughably unrealistic compared to any of the main characters. Everything else, however, the visual style, textures, lighting, environments and most of the models do their job well. Gameplay: This is where ME3 truly surpasses its predecessors. The previous games have been little more in terms of their gameplay than sitting behind cover, poping up to shoot every now and then and casting the odd ability to kill things faster. Sometimes you would have to leave cover and find a different place to shoot from. It felt horrendous in ME1, it was significantly changed and improved in ME2 and ME3 combines elements of both and improves them further. While ME1's RPG mechanics were certainly more fleshed out than the actual combat, ME2 was kind of in reverse, with less options for customization and more emphasis on quality of combat, which worked surprisingly well in that game. ME3 has both, with more options and returning features from the original along with a much tighter and more intense combat system that gives enough wiggle room to actually become good at the game. With the now much expanded arsenal of weapons, mods and equipment, all of which feel different to use, they give you the freedom to tailor your experience to your preferred play style. Firing weapons in this game feels amazing and chaining that with dodging, running, meleeing, and using powers all flow wonderfully together. My only issue is that the enemies feel a bit too bullet-spongey. Story: This is where it gets tricky. The overall quality of the writing is about the same as in ME2. So that's great. Right? Well, it is but the caveat here is that ending. I've never actually experienced the endings of the vanilla game, which was said to be not only lacking in variety, but also confusing and open-ended. Not good for capping off a complete trilogy. That's the thing though, they actually IMPROVED the ending via DLC by changing or providing additional scenes and context. That's something at least and they didn't need to do it either. They could have just left it where it was and not bother correcting their mistake so I appreciate their corrective efforts with the added complaint that it did not need to happen in the first place if they had done it properly the first time. It is not unfair to mention that ME3 has some of the most memorable and epic moments in the series and features what is probably one of my all time favorite DLC campaigns. The one in question is the Citadel DLC, which is absolutely bonkers in terms of its tone and narrative compared to anything we've seen in the series and I love it. To sum up, ME3 is an excellent game that has made some mistakes and rectified a lot of them. So long as you get the version of the game that includes all of the DLC and ignore any and all MTX's, you are in for a great experience, provided you've played the previous games of course",8,2019-12-03,PC,user

I played the game with all the dlcs, so I didn't knew what was in the vanilla version of the game, but now I know. They've cut too much stuff. Also the endings are awful... all of them. The Indoctrination Theory kinda saves it, but still it's not what I'd expect. Admit it, these guys didn't know what they were doing. EA should have given them at least a year more to finish this game... or even two or three years to actually write some decent endings. I'm disappointed in this game, because I'm dissapointed in its story... I only played for the story and got this. Still, I liked most of the game... just hate the endings.

Couldn't you tell me that before? I spent 3 hours replaying the last hour of the game because at first i thought i've chosen the wrong dialog option in conversation with Catalyst or something, and there is no save available in the last hour.

It sadden me to see that the work of countless professionals gets so bad reviews just because of a single perceived defect: the ending. And just because ""it is too linear"". I fail to comprehend how come people did not realise sooner (i.e. after the first hours with mass effect 1) that in this game all choices are just ""illusion of choices"", i.e. that all possible paths have already been settled for us, and they all lead to more or less the same outcome; because even as it is, the production cost of this kind of games is just sky high. Instead of appreciating the amount of work behind this masterpiece, the exciting journey that lead to a truly epic ending, people complain that the producer should have done even more, that they should have gone beyond budgets and nowadays technical limitations to implement ""true choices"".

It would seem that the perfect completion of the trilogy, but either did not have enough time, or the scriptwriter of the first two parts did not have enough, but the final leaves a residue. This was not how the trilogy of games was supposed to end, where you almost at every step make momentous decisions that, because of the final, 3 parts really do not matter.

dz1001,"This is a brilliant denouement to the best game series ever. Gameplay is smooth and fun and there are a number of highpoints to the story, with breathtaking scenes like the threshew maw–Reaper face-off on Tuchanka or the arrival of the allied fleets to the Solar System. The Citadel and Leviathan DLCs are great, deepening and extending the story, lore and character arcs. The controversy about the ending is quite absurd. I agree that the original endings, before the Extended Cut DLC, were lackluster, but the amended endings are fine. Unless ME3 is the only game you have played in your life, you cannot honestly say that the way ME3 ends is somehow beyond the pale. The writing in ME3 is head and shoulders above almost everything else in gaming; getting angry over endings of most games would be an improvement given that the stories of most games are too silly and forgettable for anyone to give a second thought to them. The only thing I can really fault the endings of ME3 for is that by giving the player so much choice over the future of the Milky Way, BioWare made sequels set in the Milky Way impossible, giving us the dud that is Mass Effect: Andromeda.",10,2019-03-08,PC,user

post_no_bills,"A very strange combination of bad design and good execution. It's a difficult game to review. And I suppose that reviewing it at this late date is pointless, but it feels sort of cathartic. I just finished playing (and ""finished"" in this context means ""gave up on"") Mass Effect: Andromeda, and thought I would go back and give this one another try. Time has, I believe, given a bit more perspective on ME3, and of course the added DLC has provided more depth. The individual elements of the game are actually pretty good. The graphics are good, the combat is good, the DLC is good, the game is generally well engineered. But these, mostly (excepting the DLC), are generally just incremental improvements from the last games. And then, unfortunately, there are the creative aspects. The creative decisions on story arc, the choices on companions, and - of course - the ending. Those are simply disappointing. I found it more that a bit disappointing that almost all the romantic interests from ME2 were effectively cut from ME3. Well, OK, not ""cut"" per se, but reduced in scope to meaningless. So much for emotional investment. It was also more than a bit disappointing that all of your choices narrowed down to...nothing. Good or evil, everyone ends up in the exact same place. That certainly makes a mockery of any choices you agonized over, as well as failing to align with any of the world's religions. Again, so much for emotional investment. Lastly, the ending. I will admit that the revisions they made after release changed the ending from absolutely terrible to simply disappointing, but disappointing nonetheless.

Sadly many reviews don't even understand the idea behind the game, or just forgotten how awesome ME and ME2 were. The user's score can't lie, just compare ME and ME2 user's score to this one.. it speaks by itself. The combat is too much simplified, the game is about go to the planets, scan, delivery assets and sometimes do some mission.

MeritCoba,"Is the Mass Effect trilogy as good as people make it out to be when criticizing Andromeda? I haven't played Andromeda, so I can't say from experience how good or bad it is, but to say that the Mass Effect Trilogy was better seems to me more an attempt to spite Andromeda rather than draw a fair comparison. Take ME 3 as an example. Rehash of Lord of the Rings. All the mass effect episodes based on Lord of the Rings. There is a threat on an epic scale against which only you can do something special to defeat it(ME1: Conduit; ME2: IFF, ME3: Crucible). Nobody appreciates the seriousness of the threat, either because nobody believes you(ME1) or trusts you(ME2/3) or because of politics(ALL). You have to gather forces and support often against the odds(ALL). The enemy always has some very powerful fighters(Ringwraiths) and corrupts your allies(ALL). Every next episode you have lost your hero status and nobody believes you even though by ME3 you have thrown the damn ring into mount doom twice. The only difference is that ME1 has actually got an interesting adversary with a personal story(Saren) and an interesting arch nemesis(Sovereign), while ME3 has nobody(no the illusive man isn't interesting and has no personal story and Kai Leng is a misplaced character). Boring side missions and ambush tactics. ME3 basically follows two paths: the central story and side missions. The central story leads to situations which are at least interesting. It is, however, the side missions which are trite. They follow the same pattern almost every time. You enter an area that is clearly set up for multiplayer games, you have to pick up something or activate/deactivate something which will trigger an ambush, which consists of enemies appearing out of thin air and sometimes on top of you. Most of the time you can't setup for defense because they play a movie that takes you and your squad mates out of cover. This pattern of springing ambushes plagues the whole game and is the single most mechanism it uses, even in the main battles. I don't mind ambushes once in a while, but using it in almost every encounter is aggravating. To extend the often brief encounters, they have you look around for upgrades that are spread around over the area and which can't be bought. Imagine five minutes of battle followed by few more minutes of you roaming around to find stuff, then going to the next area doing five minutes of battle and searching that area again. If it wasn't for the need for upgrades, the money, and the experience, I would have skipped these boring missions altogether. What is even worse is that almost every side missions ends with Admiral Hackett telling you that they will send a special team to the place you just liberated or conquered to protect it against further enemy incursions. Exploration dud All three ME have you explore the galaxy. Which sounds great, but in practice are fetch quests of the most annoying kind. In ME 3 it comes down to having to find planets while dodging pursuit and battling fuel shortage to find war assets, credits, and items. There is not feel of exploration. Planets are just presented as a picture with a side story. Unskippable story sequences The game is beset with unskippable movies. Which is okay unless you want to try out classes or have to redo a battle. You can only try a class after having watched ten minutes of babble. Limited Squadmates ME 3 has the gall to offer you only four squadmates to pick from or possibly six depending on how you play out a certain encounter or decided on someone. All the others are from DLC's, temporary or dependent on your save game from ME2. Some DLC's are still not free up to this day! Boring Classes The classes in ME have a few effective powers and so you to do the same thing every time. The only other way of playing is to play a different class, which forces you through ten minutes of unskippable sequences. The ending I don't mind the ending itself, but to force a favorable ending by having you collect all war assets is downright bad, especially when you have to import a savegame from a previous game to have a better chance for a good end. This forces a player to do all the boring side missions and the trite exploration and play through another game. Endings should depend on story choices and, possible, strategic decisions. Kai Leng A special mention of badness is Kai Leng, which is a character dropped into the game from some Asian setting with Katana, who is so obviously scripted not to die and be awesome cool at your expense. You're expense because you are scripted to be stupid when faced with his awesomeness. ME3 is a mediocre game at best and hailing the whole trilogy as superior to Andromeda seems laughable: ME has always been mediocre. so it is no surprise if Andromeda is mediocre too. But then again I haven't played Andromeda so I can't judge. There is much more to tell, but I ran out of space. Re-evaluated in 2017",5,2017-05-31,PC,user

Rev-nok,"Jumping right into here! Story --------- The story in Mass Effect 3 is the ending of a trilogy, and by so there’s a lot lost for those that haven’t played the previous games and I would recommend anyone coming to play the series not to start with the third as it looses a lot of its depth and meaning. However for those that don’t have a save and yet have played the other games, well that’s up to you. I played my first playthrough with a save and liked it, I did it this time without and preferred it over the other. Having played this game twice over, I found myself liking the second time more. Which I give it a lot of credit for. From what I’ve read is that people dislike the shadow sequences of the story, in which I have to disagree. It doesn’t just give a great ending to a trilogy it also shows a side of game you don’t often see, the deep artistic side of storytelling. However, taking the opinions of others into account, I can see where they might be coming from. As the same with watching a movie, you expect a certain type of movie from certain series. The lack of choices in the other as well, good and true. Having only around three large choices, in all of it. One of which turns into three branches. With an over collection of points that don’t actually give you anything at all in the end. Which is regretfully bad. Considering all the points at hand and a strong personal opinion for the artistic I’d give the story a strong 8. Graphics & Animations ---------- Alright, frankly this can always be a bit difficult to come back to. Having played ME:A and games like Witcher 3 and coming back to criticize it can be next to impossible. So instead I am rating the graphics not on how they are but how they aged. The aging of the graphics is done well, there isn’t a point where you feel that this or that is bad. Apart from perhaps some shadow quality, which I ain’t too picky about as well as some outfitting on the stale side characters. The graphics especially the cinematics in the game are astounding and live well up its time, so if you're concerned about graphics holding up, having played to many older games and just haven’t been able to finish them. Perhaps titles such as Deus Ex 1, then you have nothing to fear from ME:3 at this point in time 2017. However the animations in this game are sadly enough.. Stiff, really stiff. You feel like everything is moving a bit too slowly, running and dodging. I don’t personally have any experience with soldier gear or battle suits but wow if I were getting shot at by a giant metal monster from the sky wanting to end all life so to speak, I’d be running twice as fast and throwing myself into cover and not taking a whole five seconds trying to get over a box which is barely knee high. 4/10 Gameplay ---------- Well, what can I say about the gameplay. While there is some position commanding in this game, it frankly falls quite short as the AI aren’t good at all. I felt more than not being the only person on my team that could actually do something, and the AI’s were there to soak up some bullets while I do everything. However that might be a little unfair as the game does give you, companion skills which can also be leveled up and combo used with your own and such can be extremely vital to use in the right time. But all in all, its pretty much luck that it falls into as you move from enemy to enemy, your companions suppose to be protecting your back but for some reason let that one enemy get behind you and kill you with two shots. Companions are strong in this game, though I feel them being slightly more on their own mindset throughout this entire game, however, I have to approve of this. Though it might feel like your second priority it makes a lot of sense that you are at this time and point, while their homeworlds get decimated or their families are lost to them. A certain depth to them, which I personally wanted to see more of and acted out a bit more. Though I can’t imagine many people, would’ve liked that. 4/10. Thankfully they did better. Music & Sound --------------- The music in this game is absolutely brilliant, one of the best track lists I’ve heard. Memorable to the day you finish your first playthrough, tingling nostalgic feeling when you come to it. This team has to commanded, with fitting tracks to fitting cinematics bringing a new level of depth and emotions to the scene. The voice acting in the game is superb, especially from Joker which handles going from joking, to sad to even angry in a truthful way while many of the others do just as well. Giving an applause to all of them. 9/10 Trying to judge this game has been difficult to eye opening and I hope it leaves something to be speculated for the future generations to come. I'd play it again, with a different class.. In the future. 6,25 good enough",6,2017-05-12,PC,user

roachtbp,"I FINALLY got around to beating Mass Effect 3 (and thus completing the trilogy), and I have to say that I loved it. I am a completionist who spends HOURS on a single play through doing every single thing possible. It took me over 80 hours to beat each Mass Effect game. I only played each game through one time, but I played each game on the hardest difficulty setting possible ( Insanity for ME2 and ME3, and veteran for ME1 because that is the hardest difficulty setting available on your first play through).",10,2017-05-04,PC,user

Colbigdog67,"Just finished the game last night. I am still processing everything so I may come back later and add/edit this. I played ME:A all the way through and then decided to binge-play the trilogy as I never completed it in the past. It was well worth the 2 weeks or so it took me to get through the entire trilogy. Here are my thoughts: This was the first time I actually wept from playing a video game. No other game has tugged on the heart strings like this game and I am not the type to cry over movies and games. The music in 2 & especially 3 is just phenomenal and really works well to bring out the emo's. Yes, there are problems with the game but it's the characters hands-down that make this game great. More than the story, more than the combat (which is pretty fun in 2 &3 ), more than the graphics, it's the relationships that you develop with the characters that are unforgettable. You really do care about them and if/when one if these characters is killed, you feel the loss for real. Regarding romance, it tore me up that I had to choose between 3 women, all of whom I really loved. I had to chose one and it killed me to break the hearts of the other two. This is not a bad thing as it illustrates the emotional impact the game has on you. As for the story, it's difficult to say much about it here without spoilers. Overall, I think BW did a good job with it. Especially in making you feel like things were utterly hopeless at times, going against insurmountable odds. I was disappointed in my own ending the first time through playing it blind. I felt a little cheated by my choice for reasons that I can't really divulge here. After the game ended, I went back through the long ending sequence a few more times selecting the other endings and then spent several more hours researching the endings and their meanings. Combat was kind of ""meh"" in 1 but became fun in 2 and was polished up in 3. I played on normal difficulty as I was more into the game for the story and characters than the fighting but wanted to have some challenge to the fights. Most encounters were pretty easy to get through but there were a few times that I had to work for it. If I replay the series at some point, I'll probably go insane mode. Also, I was vanguard all the way through. There were things about the game that disappointed and frustrated me as well which is why I am not giving it anything higher than an 8. I think the DLC is way too expensive for a 5 year old game. I played the digital deluxe edition with the included DLC and I decided to purchase the Kasumi DLC as I really liked her character but opted not to pay the high price for the other stuff. It should be noted that I watched Christopher Odd play the series along with my own play through, only watching him after I completed the missions first so I was able to experience some of the missing DLC through him. If I decide to replay the series in the future, I may spring for some of the other DLCs but I've already purchased 1 & 2 on Steam back in the day and paid for the Origin annual sub so I feel like EA has gotten enough of my $. In conclusion, whether or not I ever play the series again, it will leave a lasting impact and I will consider the trilogy to be one of my most memorable gaming experiences.",8,2017-04-29,PC,user
eroeru,"I got to play it via the Origin access program, which seems like a good idea, yet falls short in still requiring you to purchase huge DLC-s via a stupid points system. No way to conveniently buy or play the whole package, and 5 years after release the game's still ridiculously overpriced. Plus, it is not featured on Steam or other platforms besides the uncomfy Origin. EA really did make things worse for Bioware (aside ruining the DA franchise). But to come to the game - I actually feel they nailed so much of what was missing in previous games. There's an actual sense of threat and sorrow, and awesome dream scenes that act as a premonition to Shepard's death. It's all rather beautiful. Lots of different consequences to choices. Killing off a former squad mate just because you couldn't explore the system she was on, after which she had been indoctrinated, is pretty impactful (yes, you don't need cutscenes or dramatically done cinematics to make things impactful, sometimes just the opposite works better). Some fans are troubled by the ""bad"" ending and sadness all abound, yet those are same kind of people that love and hate George RR Martin for the red wedding et al. They probably don't distance themselves from story enough, or don't see worth in dealing with hard subjects (a ""turn a blind eye"" kind of folk). I really was rather surprised by the overall quality of the game. It does what it's meant to almost perfectly. A shame EA is shamming customers from money still, with a 5 year old game with new AAA price tagged DLC. A bother.",8,2017-04-25,PC,user

agurczuk,"In short if you've played previous part you'll know exactly what's coming your way. If you have not than there's no real reason to pick it up before playing the previous ones. This is the final chapter in the Sheppard trilogy. The reapers arrive just as you've warned everybody. And yet everyone is surprised. And it's up to you again to save the galaxy. This game definitely feels more linear than the previous. With the reaper imminent danger most of the stories are for you to gather allies for the war. There are just a few missions you could skip but why would you really. The core mechanics are pretty much the same. You fly around the galaxy, land on planets and do missions. The missions consist of you fighting through the ranks of enemies completing different objectives in order to gain allies. Nothing really changed from the previous parts. The combat is very much cover bases - occasional grenades will make you change specific cover but that's about it. The special powers as well as your team mates feel like they're just there but not a real game changer. I think I just got bored with it. Outside of that you'll get a scanner - not really sure if it was available previously - that you can scan your vicinity in order to find artefacts and stuff. But that can alert the reapers so you'll need to evacuate soon or they'll catch you. Pretty annoying mechanic - luckily one that you don't and probably will not use during the game. The one other change is that you're presented with a war room where you can observe the allied power you have recruited. However this part confused me and apart from looking at single bar - indicating probably when you get enough allies for final mission - it's pretty much useless as well. Visually it might be a bit better than previous instalments however the animations are quite wonky, especially the running animation - this was even more visible since last game before this I played was Metal Gear Solid V which had superb animations. The ending - the most commonly criticized part - is not as bad as I've anticipated, but not good as well. It's just meh. Overall there were cool moments but the game didn't capture me. I'm glad I've played it but I don't expect ever coming back to it.",6,2017-04-21,PC,user
LifeHistory,All in all a very enjoyable game. Its a gears of war in a mass effect shell. There is almost no RPG elements in this game and by the end nothing that you did in the two amazing ME games before did matter. The game was very rushed when it could have been fantastic if only they gave it more time. The action in this game made it fun to play and am not kidding when I say it felt like I was playing Gears of war. This was as big of a disappointment as Dead Space 3.

albasile,"The final story of the Mass Effect Trilogy delivers on the long anticipated main villains that were pulling the strings from the last two games. The lore and conspiracies that surrounded these puppet masters are now gone, with the long awaited arrival and mass invasion of the Reapers. It's very clear that this is a fight for the survival of the galaxy with an ""us vs. them"" mentality that puts Commander Shepard in the heart of an all-out galactic war with the Reapers. Game play, the graphics and soundtrack are all top notch. The combat mechanics have under gone more improvements from the cover based system of its predecessor. Combat is much quicker and more accurate with a new grab melee attack system, the ability to sprint without fatigue, and a dodge roll capability that all help make combat more fluid in ME3. Mass Effect has always been about the characters, conversation, story, and exploration with the characters being ME3’s strongest attribute. Most of your previous characters return just as fleshed out as they were with the second game. There are a couple of newbies: James Vega, and another (Spoiler) who both have interesting personalities and backstories but their characters suffer only from being introduced so late in the series. There are no loyalty missions, so most of the bonding Shepard has with his/her squad mates have already been established by their history together. The story although an improvement on ME2's, still has its plot holes. (Examples: Kai Leng, and ME3's ending of course). The Plot of the story is good and it immerses the player for much of the game until the last 40-60 minutes of the story with the plot faltering completely by the game’s conclusion. One of ME3’s biggest drawbacks is the stripping down of the ME conversation abilities that Shepard has had in previous games. Conversations have been deprived to just two choices for much of the game with many conversations taking place without any player interaction. This leaves the player with less involvement in making decisions and it streamlines responses of other characters or events. Exploration has been completely gutted from ME3. It’s understandably so giving that there is a full scale galactic war going on, but it is something that is noticeably lacking given that it has always been part of ME’s formula. Lastly, ME3’s ending is one of the biggest misfires ever seen in a story’s ending with an incoherent plot, its inability to tie up loose ends, and give a satisfying and logical conclusion. The ending leaves much to be desired and it puts a huge black mark on an otherwise well-made and emotional story. In short, the ending is terrible. Mass Effect 3 had the potential to surpass even the original ME had the conversation ability been intact, less plot holes in the story, and had a good conclusion; ME3 could have easily been the best of the trilogy, but instead it's the weakest. Even with its setbacks, ME3 is still a good solid game 8/10",8,2017-03-29,PC,user
GamesBeatAll,"Okay yeah, character customisation is utter pants, some of the animations are bad, like the NCP drinking from a bottle he stuck in his eye, and another one who appears to have some horrendous body wide tic. But I can live with that. But the two things that disappoint me are the plot - or lack of it, and the dumbing down. Don't bother bringing your brain to this ME party - you won't be needing it. All the basic good stuff from ME is there, and some improvements. And yeah, I probably will play it to the bitter end, but no, I won't be pre-ordering ME 5 if there is one. The dialogues, OMG, who wrote this snooze fest? And padded out with soooo many repetitive and pointless conversations. And the basic premise, finding new homes - there is no urgency, nor strong motivation of 'all of mankind will die if you don't sort this Ryder'. It's more like an adventure holiday where you repeat the same adventures, just in a different location. Also, I don't feel my answers and decisions really make any difference, where are the massive moral dilemmas? Where are the REAL character choices? The technical issues are, well technical issues.

pinkytwist,"[Some mild spoilers about the ending.] I understand why this game is not that popular among some of the fans, specially if you played it before all the DLC came out. Personally, I only experienced the Mass Effect games recently so maybe I had a better first impression on the trilogy, specially ME3, because the DLC really added a lot to that game. I think people who were expecting a different ending allowed their whole experience be ruined when they didn't get what they wanted. I did feel really depressed when I finished ME3, but not because I thought the ending was bad. I actually liked that there is basically no perfect ending. Every choice has pros and cons and it's up to you to choose which one you think fits your Shepard best. I think this was why this game got so much hate, people got so resentful that even though the game as a whole is just as good as all the other ME games, they still rate it as a 0 just because the ending wasn't all sunshine and butterflies. Talk about being bitter. I've grown attached to my female Shepard and she is probably my favorite protagonist of all time now. Did I want her to happily ride off into the sunset with all squad members? Of course. But considering the scale of the story and the reapers as a villain, I think it would be unlikely and illogical to have that perfect ending. I think I wouldn't get as emotional as I did when those credits rolled. Overall, really good game and a perfect close to the trilogy and to Commander Shepard's story. ME3 only made my love for these characters grow even more, specially those who were with Shepard since game 1. It's really amazing to see how far they have come and how strong their relationship has become over the course of the trilogy. I'm going to miss them. I can always go back and replay it all, but it will never be the same thing as experiencing it for the very first time. I envy the people who will get to have that chance.",8,2017-03-22,PC,user

The reapers are already on Earth and we must destroy them once and for all. Epic! But the game felt so epic as we would like. I became more bored. In the story we combine race. Interesting jobs became less and more boring shooting. The combat system is even more improved, but we are forced to shoot very much.

sft,"Still not quite the full kilo I have a somewhat ambivalent relationship with the Mass Effect games. I’ve enjoyed all of them but that enjoyment has been tempered by frustration, mostly with the combat mechanics. MASS EFFECT 3 is no exception to this rule. The cover mechanics in ME2 were an improvement over those in the original game but in ME3 they have messed them up. For some crazy reason they’ve bound 3 vital actions (cover, roll, and storm (sprint)) to a single key (I believe this may also have been the case with ME2 but I don’t recall it being so annoying). This is a monumentally stupid design choice. (Now that I’ve finished the game I discover that there is a work around for the PC version – if only I’d looked earlier.) And yet, despite this, I still had fun battling the Reapers and their cronies. Aside from this the RPG elements seem to have been played down a little and there’s an option to water them down even more, so that it plays as more of an action game (I didn’t try this option, so I don’t know exactly how different the experience is). Personally, I don’t see the point in this as this is where the Mass Effect games score highly – in the RPG elements. It’s the characters, the strong story, and the detailed universe that draw you in, and make you become invested in the outcome for all concerned. And ME3 is very effective in all these areas. As always there’s lots of background information to absorb as well, if you choose to do so. The graphics are reasonable for a 2012 game (although they don’t stand out as exceptional in any way) and the voice acting is good for the most part. Overall ME3 is a worthy addition to the franchise (I won’t get into the debate regarding the ending, as this is not the ideal platform) and I look forward to Mass Effect: Andromeda.",8,2017-02-26,PC,user
Pendra,"Great storytelling and a breath taking finale offsets the gameplay shortcomings. The gameplay has more RPG elements than ME2 but still not as good as in ME1. The weapon upgrades and mods are nice. Unfortunately, all but 1-2 maps were dumbed down to rail shooter territory. The quest system is a little bit of a setback compared to ME1-2. The less handholding is nice but it is hard to tell if the mission is even completable at that point of the game. Some stuff is way too vague and gives no hint. This leaves their completion up to dumb luck. The discussion options are dumbed down to the point of being eliminated completely in some casual conversations. This usually leaves a Paragon option and a Renegade option without middle ground. Finally, some conversation option results completely out of character continuation. While many criticize the ending, I found them fantastic (extended cut). No cleat good or bad. From a moral point of view, all can be supported and dismissed. They are almost in philosophical heights. It is also very bold. Not your usual ""happily ever after"" fluff. It delivers proper dramatic writing. Without the endings, the game would be 5-6. With that 15-16. The only reason I can't give 10 is the handling of DLC. It is, hm, poor and even insulting.",9,2017-01-21,PC,user

There are some writing decisions i find difficult to understand and why they were taken, but then again im nor the developer nor a writer and its their creation and their decisions which i can respect at that, but not fully accept. Game once again takes you a memorable journey with characters you love and some new ones you might not like at all, but even after the somewhat anti climatic ending i still love this game and the emotions it pulled me through i wont forget.

E' esattamente tutto quello di buono che è stato costruito con i primi due capitoli, meno le noiose esplorazioni di pianeti vuoti (del primo) e noiose (e dannose per il tunnel carpale) scansioni per la raccolta di risorse. Quindi: gameplay OTTIMO e vario (perchè permette sia l'approccio più action di un TPS che quello strategico della gestione di risorse sul campo), storia mai banale dall'inizio ALLA FINE (lo sottolineo, visto che la più grande critica mossa a Mass Effect 3 è che il finale non rispecchia le azioni intraprese dal giocatore - anche se fosse, si confonde un videogioco con un film, il videogioco non è la **** ma il viaggio che si intraprende), aspetti tecnici sia video che audio OTTIMI, atmosfera eccellente, aspetti RPG sicuramente non hardcore ma comunque efficaci.

Ninja_Se7eN,"Disclaimer: I've played the first and second Mass Effects with all of the story DLCs and played 55 hours of Mass Effect 3 clearing the story and all story related DLC. RPGs are one of my favourite genres. Intro: On Mass Effect 3 we once again take the role of Commander Shepard tasked yet again to save the universe from a threat we've been warning them about for the past 3 years and almost everyone chose to ignore the warnings. What I liked: - The story - it's a good story except for the ending, more on that later. - Decisions that I made on ME1 and ME2 impacted how the story developed in ME3. - Minor improvements to the TPS mechanics. - I just had a single crash during my 55h of gameplay. This was a great improvement over ME2 where it crashed a lot! What I didn't like: - The ending - this is a really bad ending, on a series based upon choice and consequences and after ME2's ending being based upon on decisions of the entire game this ending just doesn't fit the game. Basically every choice you ever made is thrown out of the window and you get to choose between 4 default endings. Worse than that, none of the endings fitted my playstyle because I was the ultimate paragon, my Shepard made peace everywhere and saved everyone and there's not a single ending good enough for the good I've been doing to the Mass Effect universe. - No menu hotkeys: a hotkey for the journal and squad menus were much appreciated in the first Mass Effect. Why aren't they in the second game? Why isn't there any way to add them? - Graphics seem somehow worse than Mass Effect 2. This may be because the Alliance's colour theme is darker but overall I got some weird shadows and graphical glitches. Conclusion: This game is good if you completely ignore the ending. I really enjoyed closing the sub-plots of the different alien species in the universe and I absolutely loved the climax of my romance with Liara. The ending just ruins what was a great experience until then.",8,2016-03-26,PC,user

Things I don't, the characters are at times remarkably shallow, and so are their corresponding plots, the climax is, a little unclimatic to say the least.

Sirik_Matak,"Mass Effect 3 is a schizohprenic conclusion of the serie's contradiction. The Mass Effect, seeing it in its full spectrum, seems to go in two separate ways - backwards and forward at the same time. While the gameplay part of the series was progressing into more and more competent pop-a-mole TPS, reaching a strong mediocrity with moderate speed of the fights and a better encounters' design; the storytelling and writing departments were slipping into the pit of awfulness of tumblr level of quality. No, really. I hope you didn't cringe too much at the ""persuasion"" of Saren in the first game, because Mass Effect 3 is really thousand times worse. It's so bad, that they even copy-pasted the said scene with the Illusive Man. There are still some average bits that can be counted in favor, like solving the Genophage and uniting the Geth with their old folks - in fact they feel like they were written by absolutely different people that wrote the major parts of the main quest - like the wunderwaffe, a living Protean or the Reapers invasion itself, not to mention the ending. I think it's enough to said that they efficiently turned the Reapers from vague masterminds of unknown, through the ""I will get you next time Gadget!"" cartoony villains, into space dragons with their own zombie hordes. What I'm saying is that the premise that was present in the first game, a premise for fantasy space-opera with s-f paint all over it was lost in favor of generic high-fantasy shlock where tumblrian fan-service was more important than its integrity itself. Enough said that the first two games are absolutely irrelevant after the first minute of the third game, since apparently all the Reapers needed were 5 years to reach the galaxy and take it in a matter of weeks. Sovereign and Harbringer are pretty dumb, if they tried to pull some more elaborate schemes (it's a fan-fic level of quality I've mentioned earlier) that were equally pointless and stupid. Why to activate the Citadel and uncover yourself in trying to do so, if in other case you need and extra 5 years to reach all of the Galaxy? Why to collect people to ""build"" a Reaper (there's some cartoon science right there) and then when you finally have material, time and safety to do so (after the invasion) to abandon the idea all together and just sit there doing nothing? Do you know what's the biggest irony here? That despite the absolutely garbage writing with some cherries among it, I enjoyed the third game the most of the three, The pop-a-mole part keeps you involved enough to finish the game, assuming you start on the Insane difficulty (anything less is pointless). It's the worst game overall, because the ratio of good vs bad is off the chart, unlikely to the first Mass Effect, that is sitting in one circle of mediocrity altogether. You can see that there was little thought and work put into the technical side of the game. The texture quality was really sub-par, voice acting is just terrible (accompanied by awfully written lines it gives a really bad outcime) and don't even let me start to talk about animations.",4,2016-01-22,PC,user
Vinayaiyappa,"This game is a massive shift towards the worse, after the great first two games. The RPG element is completely gone, exploring is gone, character development is gone, all your decisions in the first two games are for squat as you get the same, **** rage-inducing ending. All those great choices you had to make, the Rachni's survival, Wrex, Samara/Morinth, Mordin's data, they are all inconsequential as you get the same **** ending anyway. Don't get me started about the ending, it's got to be the worst ending to one of the most anticipated games ever. I was worried about ME3 after the horrible experience of Dragon Age 2, and all my fears have come true.

Varrick,The game has the best combat out of the series and is probably the most fun when it comes to weapon and armor choices. NEVER play the game to completion without the extended ending and even then you will probably just choose to make up an ending for it. No your choices in the other games rarely mattered despite what they told us. The game does deserve a better score if you decide to play just this one game in the series probably a 10 out of 10. If you decided to play the entire series you will wish this game never existed due to the ending they gave us. The ending however is not the sole reason a game should be scored however it did kill my 10/10 down to a 7/10.

tonycmac,"I rate this game at a zero out of ten. I loved ME 1 and 2. I loved the character interactions, the choices, the worlds they made. ME1 had amazing words and vistas to see, and lots of them. ME2 had better game-play and amazing voice acting. Both games filled me with suspense and trepidation concerning the Reapers and the all out battle to come. ME3 did not deliver for this all out, be all- end all battle with the Sentient machines. The ending(s) were the biggest letdown I have ever experienced. My recommendation: Do not get this game. For all of the hype, the writing was appalling, thanks to the lead writer Mac Walters. The entire mood of the game, the characters and interactions, even the ending was nothing but pathetic doom and gloom. There is no ""win"", merely completion of the game (which has absolutely zero replay value). What could have been the best game in history turned out to be a massive let down that leaves you wondering if you messed something up to get such a disgraceful ending. BioWare has lost the spark. Sadly, the talent that made wonderful and fun games have all left. While the visual artists did a good job (with the exception of 8-bit running models and worse graphics than ME2) the stories that brought us joy and fun and the feeling of fresh and new worlds are simply not there in ME3. The overall arc/plot of this game is horrendous - clearly indicating a lack of skill and / or talent from the writing leads.",0,2015-10-16,PC,user
Thylbanus,"Now that I have been able to actually play it, I thought I'd post about the actual game. I'm not going to go into any spoilers, but I will address some of the furor about the game in the end. First off, the gameplay is probably the worst in the series. Control is a mess. A single control is used for running, ducking into cover, mantling, and using. Nothing is worse than running down a hallway to put some distance between you and an opponent and get caught near a wall or ledge and duck into cover, or having to stop to use an interactable object. Simply stupid. There still is no jump option, but a double click of the said ""universal"" button will cause you to make a dive roll. While melee attacks make an appearance, it's totally useless with the ""universal"" button, except in surprise. Missions finally received a notification on the map, but only the important ones. Hell, you have to actually keep track of side quests on your own. You woun't know if you completed a sidequest until you try to go back and do it again. There is no notification that you have what you need and are allowed to turn it in. Some of these are actually worth turning in for the assets they provide. Inventory is even more opaque than ME2. While they did have a comparison guide that showed the difference between your equipped item and an observed item, it's done in bars and not numbers. Call me simple, but I prefer numbers to bar graphs. This is where ease of information ends. Once you have a certain brand of weapon, you can then purchase the next in the series (I, II, III, IV, V), but all it says is that it improves the item. Doesn't give any specifics on what is improved, or give comparisons to justify the cost. WHEN you find the weapon makes no difference in it's ability. The crappiest shotgun in the game isn't found until late the second act and it costs more than the better selections to upgrade. So price does not equal benefit. Level design is questionable, at best. Some is just downright mindboggling. It's like the level designers had no idea how the mechanics of the game would function. Few are designed reasonably well, good flow and logical objectives with just enough variety to allow for varied gameplay. Most of the time, run and gun is simply the best option. After a while, you get locked into the mindset of run and gun when they try to force you into a different mindset and you have to die before realising that you needed to go easy this time. There was simply more bad than good here. Saying that the difficulty was cranked up is a like saying 1.01 is technically greater than 1. For all the complaints about the ending, it's not really a surprise that it ends the way it does. This game promised unprecedented agency, but realistically speaking couldn't deliver within the formats it was targeting. The ending, viewed through a lense of time and complaints past, really highlights that it was a big furor for all the wrong reasons. The ending was completely viable as an ending. An anticlimactic ending. The omissions in narrative aside, the whole story was well done. This is about the only thing that was. The rest of the game is what was messed up. This whole climactic build up that was pretty much spent in a cutscene. A cutscene that is the same in every way, no matter what the play though. No, I'm not talking about the red/green/blue ending, but the assault on Earth. All the running around you did meant nothing to the game other that what color ending you got. There is no pitched battle for Earth. I honestly expected some movement around the globe to take back strongholds and then finally attack the the main objective. Nope, just a final board upon landing. The moments of fighting among the your various rallied troops is but a passing nod to what you did. The real loss of the illusion of agency wasn't the ending, it's everything that built up to it. None of it mattered. If you rallied factions A, B, C, E, and G and lost D and F. No biggie. Didn't cost you anything, but MAYBE a missing person to talk to. Hell, one faction is pretty much completely missing even if you had not done any of the others. Maybe if each faction was tasked with taking back a part of Earth and was as long as the final objective and the final objective was twice as long, it might have felt like an accomplishment. As it is, the final level is noticeably short and plainly evident that what you did meant nothing. I never once thought to myself, ""I'm sure glad I have faction X at my side in this fight!"" Doesn't matter. That is the real problem. TL:DR - Story good. Gameplay bad. EA failed to deliver in gameplay what the excellent narrative provided. Shame.",4,2015-09-23,PC,user

I also hate to rehash the same things everyone else says but the ending was terrible, I would've liked more after all the time invested in the story, my choices to mean more than a choice between three colors of fireworks.

Yes, I would have made the ending different, too, but honestly, it's not THAT bad and giving less than a 7 or 8 rating because of it is ridiculous. I played the extended version. + Characters: The series has always had some of the best and most believable characters and it hasn't changed. + The game has moved the series forward technically by a lot. Movement, shooting, the interface - it all looks and feels much better. + The presentation (graphics, sound, cutscenes, videos) is fantastic. + Your choices from the previous games are all saved and there are many new ones to make. + Lots of customizable weapons and armors. + Good NG+ implementation. - DLCs. Just stop this **** When I pay for a game, I want all of it. - Origin: Origin is useless crapware, like Uplay. Always online ****. Let me play the single player without internet. I will never pay the full price for Origin games, but rather wait until they're for sale. - The ending: It was delivered flawlessly, but there are definitely some things about it that don't make a lot of sense.

HarryXie,"Mass Effect 3 is not the best game in the series, but it's definitely a good one. Left alone the whole ending controversy, the game is excellent. Choices, especially the one between the Geth and the Quarians, are still pretty difficult and intriguing. A much larger variety of guns are brought into the game, and they give the game a sense of progress. The combat is fast and exciting, though sometimes in some side missions it can get repetitive. Mass Effect 3 also has the atmosphere of apocalypse that Mass Effect 1 and 2 don't. The desperation and struggle of the whole universe can be easily felt. The ending, after the Extended Cut, is okay. It's still a lot worse than the epic battle in Mass Effect 2, but it does make some sense and gives us a final conclusion about Shepard and the whole Reaper mystery. Overall, it's a finale that doesn't reach the level of Mass Effect 2 but still pretty satisfying and powerful.",9,2015-08-06,PC,user

ApolloDown,"There is no way to review this game fairly. So much is so good about it, and so much is so terrible about it. I will do a pros and cons list as I think that's the only way to really get an idea for what you are getting into. Before I do, let me state for the record that Mass Effect 2 was and still is my favorite game of all time. Let me also give you some advice - if you are playing this for the first time, use the MEHEM mod. It is the only way to salvage the ending. Either that or let Marauder Shields cut you down and never watch the actual ending. You'll know when it happens. PROS Excellent art Excellent combat Excellent dialogue Excellent DLC Great moments in the story. Legion on Rannoch always makes me tear up. Same with Mordin on Tuchanka. Great dialogue. Drunk Tali FTW. Marauder Shields. CONS The ending. The extended cut does nothing to address the problems. Anybody who thinks it does is simply not paying attention. Cut corners(femshep running out of combat animations are a good example) Kai Leng. Why am I afraid of a dude with a sword when I literally have a computer sword on my arm and/or space magic and guns? Horrible dialogue. See Kai Leng. See also James Vega. See also Miranda. See also Jacob. Again. Blatant cash grab(you win! Buy DLC!) Star Baby. The Illusive Man going from excellent bad guy with believable motivations to total moron absentee landlord. Streamlined combat. I miss the Blue Suns. I miss getting hit with biotics. Kai Leng again. Lack of character differentiation in cut scenes(I'm a biotic, why am I always(or ever) pulling a pistol? And why is my pistol always the crappy one I NEVER use?) Bullet sponges are not a good gameplay mechanic. Ever. Banshees could have been so much scarier. They ultimately just bore and/or infuriate me. The ending(guys, the ending is AWFUL. There is a reason for the terrible reviews) Lack of choice(5 or 6 real choices, everything else just goes the same) Lack of consequences(see also lack of choices) Female characters that look like they were based off a 13 year old's fantasies(See EDI cameltoe, See also Liara boobs, see also Ashley default outfit) Killing characters that I worked to keep alive HARD in ME2 offscreen is a sin(sorry Kelly) Planet scanning is not a side quest. No variety in hub worlds, just the citadel. I want my Illium back. Kai Leng again(Bioware, I get that you wanted a cool villain. But the **** to scary ratio is too high, partly because he's not scary(see swords don't scare my space gun wielding badass) and partly because he is full ****) Star Baby again. Dat ending. Do I play Mass Effect 3 multiple times? Yes. Do I always feel cheated each time? Yes. But I always end up playing it again. Bioware and EA, somehow you have found a way to give me disappointment on demand. I pre ordered this game, and this game has guaranteed I will never pre order a game again. Continue doing business this way and you will not stay in business. This game has very much earned its user score. On a side note, you can very clearly see what is wrong with game journalism today by comparing the user score to the curated score. This game made me stop looking at journalist reviews, period. You have proven that you cannot be trusted to be honest.",6,2015-07-13,PC,user
Efferkongen,"I am a HUGE Mass Effect fan, and I got so say that the third is the best. It's combat system has been improved a lot, it's amount of dialogues are numerous, it's humor is great, and it's story awesome! However, a few mentions about it's flaws: It's a shame that it doesn't give you the chance to involve any of your previous party members from the second game. Even if some of them has good reasons, it should still be an option to include them, and take the consequences of them joining you. The ending which a lot of people are mad about are worth mentioning as well. I personally love the explanation of why the reapers do the cycles, it makes sense, especially from a machines cold couculations. However, what disappointed me the most, what the unresolved matter with the Illusive man. Everything in 2 and 3 points to that he has a plan with the reapers that could be useful and effective, but morally screwed, but he is just indoctrinated for no reason, which is a huge letdown for me. Those are the two main reasons that I don't give this game a 10/10, because it just remove some of the best things in Mass Effect that could have made it completely epic.",9,2015-07-07,PC,user
MenaBanana,"An amazing game with a disappointing ending. Bioware flopped, big time. The multiplayer is very enjoyable, and the game itself will keep you on the edge of your seat. Players who start with 3 will probably think this to be one of the best games of all time, and it is in a sense. However, long time fans will be let down with the ending. Having believed for years that your actions in 1 and 2 will somehow impact the outcome you will be faced with the reality that this isn't so, and that the endings aren't even that different. Take what you will from this, the hype mislead it's fans. And bioware is still paying for this.",7,2015-06-30,PC,user
inkblowout,"After reading some of these comments... how can some people give this a rating of 0 because of the ending? So 20 minutes of gameplay out of 24-30 hours of gameplay is a good reason to give this a 0, 1, or even a 2. I know some have given good explanations for their ratings but some are just biased to read. The fact is. I had fun throughout this entry of mass effect, it is weaker than the other 2 but it was a hell of a ride for me. The problems I had from this game though were 3 things. Lack of character interaction, mission and side missions and the ending. So lack of character interaction really bothered me because in mass effect 1 or 2. You could be able to talk with your squad after every mission and you could talk about them, you would talk about their family, their personal lives and etc. and you could choose to what to say. But what mass effect 3 really does is that they give these one directional liners which does talk about what's going on with the mission. But it takes away your ability to choose conversation options which is a real letdown in my opinion. 2nd complaint is the missions and side missions. Although the priority missions make sense to the story. The side missions and journals fell like a chore to gain war assets so that you can thrive for that ""prefect ending"". Unlike journal/side missions in mass effect 1-2. They would either consist of exploration, fighting baddies and etc. But mass effect 3. Most journal missions are achievable by scanning which is also a let down. And lastly the ending is the biggest problem to the series. Ya sure the ending **** but it is difficult to end off a kickass trilogy. (I couldn't even think of any better endings as well.) I don't know why this ending was made. The 3 choices are stupid and dumb if you think about it. It should have been. Activate the crisable and let it do it's job. There shouldn't have been those 3 endings. It felt like bioware was going toward the deus ex style of ending but failed. And the extended cut doesn't help at all... it just explains stuff in detail but doesn't change the initial ending. Starchild was also a nuisance as well... ever since I went up in that elevator and saw starchild, I knew the ending was bad. But honestly overall, I had a great time playing this game, the game's combat was entertaining and there was so much stuff that made the game so memorable. Bioware did let me down in a way... but I was happy I played this game. I had the chance to not to buy this game despite reading the hate reviews on this game. But I did and I don't regret any of it.",7,2015-06-24,PC,user

If after having a field day at an amusement park end with some guy throwing up on you, you consider it to be the ""worst day ever"" you didn't deserve to go, and that's what the ME franchise has been. ME1 was great, had it's hiccups but where it shined was the sense of scale, it's combat fell short. It was fine but we needed more. ME2 was great in characters, you felt more for your squad then you ever did before, in return you lost alot of that scale, but still great. ME3 took from both and ended with something almost spectacular. Felt bigger than 2 but not as big as 1, characters were almost as good as 2 way better than 1, and it's combat blew 'em both outta the water. That ending though.",9,2015-06-19,PC,user

smeeeee,"Behold Mass Effect 3, a victim of greed, the ""good enough"" approach, and America's corporate devil assuming direct control (yay puns) of an innocent Canadian developer. Mass Effect 3 had the potential of being a masterpiece, and even showed signs of it- BioWare improved the combat system, adding new guns, keeping the epic old ones (Mattock FTW!!!), and adding heavy melee, combat rolls, and instant kills from cover. The graphics are truly stunning, the new enemies are challenging and sometimes can scare your socks off, and BioWare brought back the awesome characters from previous games- Garrus, Grunt, or anyone you didn't kill. But what mainly brought the game down was the all-too famous ending (or endings). Even with the Extended Cut DLC (which is a cheap way to squeeze even more $$$$$ out of you, it only adds a few lines to the ""ending""), it's basically like a magician saying, ""Pick a card! Any card!"" It's basically just choosing between A, B, and C (and D with EC). The worst part: It's littered with plot holes. For the sake of those who haven't played it yet, I won't say too much about the ending, but I can assure you, it's one of the worst endings in video game history. What also brought the game down was the INSANE amount of DLCs. There's literally like 14 DLCs! It's crazy! Why on Earth must someone pay more for a game that's already theirs?! Also, characters like Jack, Miranda, Kelly, and Jacob were like completely left to hang and dry. In the end, Mass Effect may be addicting for its sweet game-play, and interesting characters, but the rest of the game just sends you away empty. So yeah. EA Mass ef*cked Mass Effect 3. Or at least they came very close to doing so.",5,2015-03-29,PC,user

praXis,"People heavily criticize this game for its ending, but I found it to be fairly consistent with the rest of this sequel's content - contradictory, confused, cliche, and just horribly written. It's painfully obvious that Bioware lost some valuable people in all departments after ME2, and that while Mac Walters did a decent job as a character writer in the past, a lead writing position is beyond his current abilities. I mean, Mass Effect never had Pulitzer-winning content but when all the fun and well-established character is **** out of a series by genuinely BAD dialogue and truly ridiculous story elements, it's a damn shame. Positives? Great combat, some epic setpieces (squandered unfortunately), and a sense of closure. The guns feel and sound better than ever. Quickly dodging from cover to cover, or launching quickly over barriers with a double-tap of the spacebar is great. The quality and variety of new enemies is very good. The multiplayer is ACTUALLY FUN - though not too varied. The maps are good, though rarely memorable. Most cutscenes are impressive. The new character of Javik is great. The fact that you only get him with the From Ashes DLC is RIDICULOUS. Should be included with the base game as he adds a significant amount of context and depth to the story. Negatives? Terrible new characters: James Vega - bodybuilding Jersey Shore dudebro, Diana Allers - pointless embedded journalist in a little rubber dress, Kai Leng - evil space ninja (not kidding). WTF Bioware. Maybe these characters are supposed to somehow be canon, but were just introduced and utilized poorly - my point that they are terrible in this game still stands. The faces of many of the characters have been changed from ME2, and simply look bad. Joker comes to mind right away. What the hell is going on with his mouth? This is an inexplicable step back from the models and animations in ME2. Model glitching and bad camera during dialogue. (You'd think they'd have figured this out by now.) Painfully bad and cliche dialogue with terrible pacing. Mac Walters loves cheesey Hollywood military action movies, apparently. He's about as good at re-creating their content as a 14-year-old boy though. Doesn't stop him from trying. Moral choices seem tacked-on and weird, but that's probably just the writing. Disappointingly dumbed-down inventory and leveling for the sake of console kiddies. Not much RPG left, but that could be said for ME2 as well, I guess. More overpriced DLC horsecrap. We hate you for good reason, EA. You should figure out a way to monetize that. ME1 is one of my favourite games of all time - even with its blemishes. It's a damn shame this series had to end (Yes, I know about ME4 - but after this, I'm done with this series) with a wet noodle **** that is a mere shadow of what it should and could have been.",6,2015-03-26,PC,user

Guinness,"Considering more new updates on the ME4 lately, I thought that it may be useful to do renewed review of ME3 for anyone who is still uncertain about it. I will not review the game as out of box Vanila which came out in 2012, but rather as combined experience of main game, its DLCs and vast variety of fan created mods which in my experience in large enhance the play. First, to address the area of ending. I do too agree that even after you install the “extended” cut option, the final choice is just somewhat less vague but as equally depressing. In my experience, the most optimistic ending I achieved was the one in which a glimpse of what resemble Sheppard’s body comes to life. Although satisfying in the sense that Cmdr. Sheppard could still be alive, it simply does not merge with the previous events which led Sheppard to the final scene. For me even worse than the ending, was the increasingly negative mood throughout the entire game. Even the few happy moments which existed, simply felt out of place. This is not understanding for me, considering Shepard’s character is successfully completing series of events, which in turn increasingly enabling huge alliance of interstellar nations to fight the invaders. That realistically would lead to more optimistic mood with characters and story, regardless of the final outcome. Few words about mods, which at this time are widely available and very successful in improving the visuals in the game. As it is known, the vanilla version of the ME3 was very disappointing, featuring low resolution textures, and rather bad environmental appearance. Even the Sheppard appearance never matched your character appearance form M1 and 2. With series of texture updates, and with help of FX lighting mods, the game really gets vibrant. I would say the mods are must to ensure the full immersion. In terms of game and story contents, I think it exceed the experience from ME2, even without the DLC. If DLCs are installed, some additional time gain is achieved, but not necessary better experience. At least in case of Omega which is simply just a shooting spree. Lavithian is somewhat special, in respect that it does offer more story, but it is very short. In case of Citadel, Bioware went step up and actually developed descent side task with much needed fun aspects of the game. In fact, had I have a chance to play Citadel when I first played ME3, I would stop the game right there and not even venture into the final cut. Overall, once properly moded, and with addition of DLCs, I found the game likable, regardless of the weak story and final outcome. It is a story shooter, but it can still be immersive, and it is not all running through objectives. There are definitely aspects of RPG in the game, they are just not as prominent. I have logged over 120hrs with just one play-through, including main game and all DLCs, which is more than I expected.",8,2015-02-18,PC,user
Munkey,"Mass Effect 3 is a disappointing ending to the series. Mostly combat based, lacking in good story telling and less dialogue options then in previous titles. From the start you feel that something is wrong. The change of lead writter for the third game was a mistake. NPC characters are still good but there is not that much interaction then in ME and ME2. The day one DLC NPC was a big mistake also. The DLC character Javik being the last of the Protheans is vital to the story but you make him a DLC. You see the money hand of EA in this game. The ending is so disappointing even the extended cut didn't make it better.

therob91,"This should have been(and nearly is) the greatest story/character driven RPG of all time, but Bioware made a MAJOR mistake with the final title. This game is absolutely incredible until you hit the last 10 minutes. Honestly maybe even the last 5 minutes, because the story was ramped up and paced so perfectly that the lead up RIGHT UNTIL the ending is once in a generation exceptional. Then you get to the ending and I don't know if they ran out of money or what, but it completely falls flat and ignores all of the style of the series. It changes from a game about choices building up and coming together to create an epic finale (across 6ish years for people that played the games when they came out) into a 3 pronged choice that ignores every choice made in any of the 3 games and, in a game HEAVILY influenced by film(to the point of having a grain filter naturally active to appear more like a movie) has a final few moments that feel more at home in an ending to a fighting game characters story or even something like a shmup. I'm torn on what to give this game. Its clearly a 10/10 until the ending, but this game is ABOUT the story, A weak ending in TES or Fallout isn't that big a deal because they are different style games. This game is about story and characters and the main concept of the game is basically thrown out the window in the final moment.

marc5477,"Preface: I played the original game without any DLC. For the most part, the game feels like Mass Effect 2. Combat is basically the same and RPG elements are still reduced to minimal. It really does play more like a shooter or adventure game than an RPG. Loot is still minimal and customization is basically non-existent aside from choosing from a very limited number of weapons and armor, many of which were very similar to each other. There is never a feeling of progression that is associated with RPG's but for what its worth, combat was actually fun in the same way that shooters are fun. Many things annoyed me in this game aside from not going back to its ME1 RPG roots. The biggest is the planet exploration... if we can even call it that. Orbit a planet, click a button and thats is all there is to it. Very silly and reminded me of playing ET on the Atari. The only challenge to it is to escape from the flying Reapers which was entirely trivial and mind numbingly boring. I liked how they tried to make every mission have an impact on the ending of the game. The more you complete the better your odds of getting a better ending. Unfortunately they completely dropped the ball on the impact of the score on the story as all the endings were pretty much the same regardless of score. I also hated the fact that you cannot get the best ending without playing multiplayer. I do not want to play with others in a 1 player game. Yet I could not get my readiness high enough to get the best ending. Besides, by the time I reached the end, I was so bored of the game I just wanted to end it not play more with people I never met. Next, I thought the ending was rushed. As it turns out, much of what you do in the game was not necessary because the endings would be about the same if you rushed through the game anyway. You are always presented with the same options and there is very little difference between the high readiness endings and the minimal endings. It felt like I wasted my time running around finishing missions especially since there was minimal RPG progression. I dont think the endings are terrible, but they were definitely not as exciting as I would have expected them to be given it was a trilogy. Last, there is only 1 real boss battle in the entire game and it was too easy. Most of the other battle finales were not really bosses but rather assignments like painting a target or surviving a few minutes. There were no imposing battles at any point in the game and I never felt like I was in danger. There were a few battles that were cheap since you did not know where the enemies were coming from but after you saw it once it became trivial. Which brings me to annoyance, there is no mini map. If you want to see the map you have to bring it up manually and it still did not show enemy position thus taking away any form of strategy you might want to employ. its kind of ironic that there was no mini map but you could always see your mission objective target painted clearly without the map. I ran into two game breaking bugs that could have ended my games early (and neither were ever fixed). One was on the deck of the ship. Shepard simply gets stuck near Joker and cannot move no matter what you do. This bug can happen any time in the game. It is a well known bug and has not been fixed. The only way to work around it is through loading a previous save and making sure to save before entering the area. If you quick-saved while stuck hoping a reload would fix the issue, then you can really mess up your game because you will load into the game stuck. The only other solution is to get a 3rd party save game editor where you have to manually edit your save and change your save position. The other game breaking crash happened while on a mission. At some point, as you progressed, you walk through a door and the game simply crashes every time. This is also a common bug and has not been fixed. Luckily there was a work around. You have to inch through the door and continuously quick save until the game crashes. If you quick saved inside the room, you will be able to load the new save inside the room and the crash will stop. Still, its unbelievable that this has not been fixed. Overall, the game was not great. It lacked any innovation compared to parts 1 and 2 and felt rushed when you account for the game breaking bugs, lazy endings, lack of exciting fights/bosses, and weak story tie ins. Essentially, all your decisions ultimately did not matter very much from previous games, and much of what you do in ME3 is pointless since the ending are all very similar. Its not a horrible game but it was definitely boring after the 1st hour due to lack of RPG progression and lack of gameplay-story impact. I do not recommend this game if you are looking for an RPG. If you are a heavy FPS fan I would give this a 6/10 instead of a 4/10.",4,2015-01-15,PC,user
Ghost67,"Mass Effect 3 was a difficult game to score. In fact it's been one of the most difficult games for me to review. You can tell right off the bat that something is off with ME3. Something is seriously wrong. And you know what is wrong with it? It was released way too early. And it shows. When the game begins, you are forced into auto-dialogue. The pacing is terrible. All of a sudden, Reapers are attacking and everyone is shocked. Really? The intro is ****. I remember the release for ME3, it was painful. Yes, this is the game with the near legendary infamous Day 1 DLC. The game release is an obvious console port. The textures are awful; the game looked worse than ME2. That's a big red flag right there. When a sequel's graphics are worse than the preceding title, something is up. Some people say that ""it's the journey, not the destination"", that matters, and I agree with that to a certain extend. The journey itself is not bad in ME3. It follows a similar formula to ME2. ME2's hybrid FPS shooter gameplay is enjoyable in ME3. It's been improved and built upon in ME3. I like that. It **** storytelling. The storytelling and choices, the choices and their results are lacking. Choices that have been made in previous games for some reason do not matter. If someone is killed off, they are convieniently replaced with someone else that has a similar sillset. Some characters are once again completely taken out and you can't get them back in your party. If you made some romance options in ME2 - you might find a half assed romance plot instead. These characters and their stories are just thrown to wind. There are scenes incorporated into ME3, but they feel like add ons and not the full experience. Once again, rushed content and development. These feelings of relationships of both friendship and romance being ""tacked on"" is felt throughout the ENTIRE GAME. And it ****. Bioware has gone to far to kill some characters off screen. That is a cardinal sin in a Bioware game. For example - I romanced Miranda in ME2. Guess what? In ME3, shes not there. She just - disappears. Literally. There is really not fitting conclusion to your relationship - unless of course, you cough up the money for the Citadel DLC. And for some reason, she is....completely out of character. Doing things and acting in ways that you would have never seen in ME2. Now, multiply this times 10. Painful. And unfortunately, the ending is completely and totally botched. Sorry to say it. The ending is awful. Not only is it dark and depressing, but it's relatively obscure in the fact that your choices did not really seem to matter. I understand that it tried to be a self contained game, but that just isn't going to fly for ME3. In the age of DLC's and online downloaded content, Bioware could have taken the risk of making ME3 completely dependant on ME2's save. The ending is so bad, gamers had to come out and demand that Bioware offer a better ending. Yep. You read it right. Bioware actually - was forced - to change the ending. Get it? Gamers had to tell Bioware - let them know - that the ending was botched. How utterly embarrassing for Bioware. This resulted in another embarrassment for the industry, with an editor from IGN coming out defense of Bioware in a stupid, arrogant video, something about ""Gamer entitlement."" Yes, you gamers are not entitled to a good ending. Bioware can do anything they want, and you better shut the hell up and enjoy it, damnit! In ME3, in order to gain resources you must play with other players online. This is a bad decision. Bad, bad bad for a single player game. This was clearly a result of EA meddling in development. The requirement to play online with other players is asinine. Though its not completely mandatory, if you want the ""good"" ending, you pretty much need to do it unless you want ****..""manually edit"" your game. Cough... Overall, ME3 is not a terrible game. But it is not a satisfying conclusion. In fact, the ending itself is kind of laughable. The whole ending sequence, even with the DLC is just too ambiguous and poorly done. It's a real shame. I wanted to like ME3 but its a poor and disappointing conclusion to the series.",5,2015-01-07,PC,user

zylaser,"A disappointing end of the series. It tried to be a self-contained game, but that just renders most of the plot of previous games irrelevant; you stop the Reapers time and time again, and they come anyway. Very few decisions in previous games matter - killed a character earlier? A very similar substitute fills the exact same role. The story has its ups and downs, but doesn't make much sense overall. And that's without getting into the ending - out of place, illogical, just plain dumb. The extended ending does give some nice fluff and closure, but doesn't fix the core issues. The gameplay is mostly the same as in ME 2, but with some decent improvements. There are more abilities and choices when levelling characters. Weapon modifications are nice, but limited in their variety. Having more movement options is nice, but the ""one button does all"" system is annoying as **** You want to roll? Or run, or press a button, or vault over cover, stick to cover, leave the cover? Too bad you're dead as you shuffle around desperately, fighting the contextual controls instead of the enemy.",5,2014-12-08,PC,user
gostarkgo,"An absolutely outstanding game, until the endgame phase. After three games of loving every second the sadness of it all coming to an end was bested only by the most anticlimactic ending imaginable. At the end of the game you will find yourself feeling that none of the choices you made had any impact on the final outcome. And at the end of it all playing the previous games means very little beyond some minor changes to the cinematic sequences. What a disappointing end to an outstanding series of games.",8,2014-12-03,PC,user
Halefire,"This is an update to my previous review, in which I gave this game a 5. That review was written in the week after release when the infamous ending controversy was just getting underway with more and more people finishing the game. Since then, Bioware has released a large, free patch called the Extended Cut DLC. This was controversial as well, with popular gaming entities like TotalBiscuit still lampooning the game for the endings, but ultimately I feel this extended cut did what it needed to in order to rescue the game. To summarize the new endings rather pithily, while the overall endings haven't necessarily changed, both the final dialogue with a certain spoiler-y character and the actual endings themselves have been *greatly* expanded. Nearly every single issue I found fault with story-wise has been addressed in terms of loose plot threads. Better yet, you now get to see what happens to your companions post-ending, and the context of one or two of the endings has been *significantly* altered. Other DLC since then has also substantially improved my opinion on this game. This game is *by far* the best sci-fi RPG that we've had in a decade, maybe even several decades. It is absolutely beautiful, flows wonderfully, and features a multiplayer mode that initially everyone was apprehensive about but ended up being a wonderfully smooth, engaging experience. I'm re-writing this review again because in all my years of gaming, I think Mass Effect 3 is the one game I have not been able to replay after those first few months simply because I couldn't find enough time to set aside for the post-ME3 depression that inevitably sinks in. No other game has been able to hit me on such an emotional level, and I would argue games like ME3 and Bioshock Infinite (the latter less so perhaps) should be held up as prime examples of gaming as an extremely powerful storytelling medium. Those are the only two games I've ever played for which I need to remove the emotional songs when listening to the sound tracks because I don't need those feels out of the blue during the day. Honestly, were some in-game qualms fixed I would say that such an emotional effect would merit a 10/10. As it stands, what with the ending somewhat-retcon and the fact that Javik is a DLC character, I can only max it out at 9/10 (as much as I hate gaming scores)",9,2014-11-30,PC,user
Mudgee,"Where my interest int the first two of the series weren't strong, ME3 seemed to have that draw, that feel of combat and consequential decision making that I love so much. Any game that promotes choice and consequence is a winner in my books, and ME3 does that very well on many occasions. Whilst i've never been a fan of the combat systems in ME3, It does bode better then the first two. If you were only going to pick up one game in the series, this is the one. Luckily, you do not need an extensive history lesson on ME lore to understand what is going on.",8,2014-11-24,PC,user
Admiral_TSon,"Mass Effect 3 is a worthy conclusion to the Mass Effect trilogy and skillfully immerses the player in the hype and drama that the series has been building to. ME3 is the best written of all of the games in the trilogy, and the user is now able to see how past decisions will impact the expected climax of the series. The series also leaves the player with many choices to be made in this installment too, however, with some of the best political/diplomatic story arcs of any RPG series. While the ending is much chided by fans, I believe it is a logical ending to the series as it resolves the fundamental question/conflict presented to us by the plot in ME1. Pros: -Combat system perfected with options for heavy melee/more combo options/more abilities/options for biotic Shep -Exceptionally well written plot with very dramatic and well-designed cutscenes -Excellent graphics (for 2012) -More fulfilling Romance options + ability to romance select same-sex characters -Interesting and engaging side-quests -Ending resolves fundamental question/conflict in series in a thought-provoking way, making the ME trilogy not just a combat RPG, but a true ""video game novel"" Cons: -While the ending is very well written in fundamentals, the frame by which it is prevented does come across as a somewhat contrived ""Deus ex Machina"" -While side quests are enjoyable, many can only be completed after a certain main mission is completed (but will appear in your journal before you can complete them!) or must be completed before a main mission is completed. This forces a completionist gamer to occasionally research side-quests to make sure they get it done by x or y mission. ME3 is a fitting end to the ME trilogy. With the extended cut DLC, the much-chided ending should be found by gamers who enjoy a good story as a fitting resolution to the questions/conflicts presented throughout the series.",10,2014-11-21,PC,user
Rycr,"A good game with a disappointing ending. To be honest, I never really believed the hype about how every choice throughout the series would have a huge effect on the end result of the game, so in the end I wasn't really disappointed. I do think the gameplay is a nice balance of the better combat mechanics of ME2 with the customization options of ME1, though.",8,2014-11-19,PC,user
araut,"Although most of the reviews are negative, i must say i'm happy with the game overall. The end, tho a bit disappointing, in my opinion, fits (not perfectly) the story constructed so far. Is there a better fitting end? Yes, i believe so, but the presented alternatives are not that bad; but a surviving Shepard would be better, for sure. The major flaws of the game are not in the ending. It has many bugs, some inconsistencies in story line and lore. For example, in ME2 Samara told Shepard that only 3 Ardat-Yakshi existed (her daughters), and we (usually) killed one of them in game. Now in ME3 there are so many that they need a Monastery to remain apart and isolated from society. There are some places to go and many side quests to do, but the only place where you do spent some decent time is the Citadel. There are not huge places with many quests to do, like in ME2 where you spent some good hours in Ilium, Tuchanka, Virmine and Omega, just to name some. The side quests also seems a bit shallow (end too **** with exception of the some moments at the last part of the game, the quests are fairly easy to accomplish. There are some humor on the dialogues, but it seems that, through all the game, you have less options (and even less people to talk to) than you had in ME1 and ME2. The mechanics of armor and weapons and damage are also worse as they were in ME1 and ME2. You buy the upgrade of you current weapon, so shotgun 1 is bought into shotgun 2..3...4 and so on, which takes the ""happiness"" of finding a new upgraded version of your current weapon. Armor customization has its benefits, but it's a bit tricky to compare different armor configurations, since you lack the ""all info in one screen"" tab, so it is harder to see if a +10% shield shoulders do the benefits you're looking for. Mass Effect 1 did a great job in this camp. Here's another problem: percentages. All improvements - weapons and armor - are upgraded by percentages. This is problematic in terms that if you have a low damage weapon, and want to upgrade its damage (in a scenario where you like the other aspects of this particular weapon, like accuracy and reload speed), a 20 % dmg increase won't even show in your graphic readings of that weapon. You would get some results only if there were in game improvements around 200 or 300%. So all is in absolute terms, which in this case is not a good option. A numeric version would be better (like increases damage by 70 points or such). The reapers interfering on galaxy map traveling is a bit pain, and you hardly do some good deed in your travels, because exploration is in short supply here too. I miss Ilium, i miss all those colonies and random quests, but most of all i miss the heavy rpg element. There are too much cinematic sequences and fewer interaction in game. Overall i'd say you have less choices than the 2 previous titles. Bioware saw this so clearly that the next game on the franchise will feature back the old exploration of ME1 (with a better version of the vehicle Mako) and, with some luck, some good space exploration with had on ME2 (like docking on deranged space station). This surely is more an shooter with rpg elements than the otherwise. It is a good game, don' t get me wrong, but surely it was rushed into completion, and those of us who spent hundreds of hours playing the first 2 titles surely will miss a lot of the good elements presented on the past.",7,2014-11-16,PC,user
effataigus,"I recommend doing two things: 1. reading all of those negative reviews, 2. and playing the game anyway. I expected such an awful game after that that I was actually pleasantly surprised. Also, it's now being sold for ~$10 instead of ~$60, sooo... Oh, and the game is pretty annoying if you did play ME1 and 2 and don't have the ""saves"" for them. I kinda think they should just let you answer a multiple choice quiz about what ya did in the last games.",8,2014-11-15,PC,user
HenriqueV,"Of course those bad reviews from gamers are out of place. The end was indeed bad, but it was still a pretty solid game. The gameplay is easily the best one in the series, and the game is really successful in creating an atmosphere where you get the feeling that the world is falling apart and there is little hope left. It wasn't a game that would suit a happy ending. I believe even if the ending wasn't rushed and incomplete, lots of fans would still believe it was bad because it was not a typical ""Star Wars everybody is happy and the world is in peace again"" ending. The big problem with the game for me was the lack of characters interaction. You never get the same depth you did in previous games, specially Mass Effect 2. If one character is not a love interest, then probably you only will get some random lines while you are on Normandy. Another big issue is that, after playing the game, turns out that your decisions during your journey made zero to none impact in the final outcome. ME3 deserved to be the best one of the trilogy, but at the end of the day it was easily the less enjoyable one, perhaps because the game could not fulfill the amount of expectation created by the previous games. But it was also a memorable game and easily one of the best of its generation.",8,2014-11-12,PC,user

The ending was poorly explained and the explanation we got from""god-child"" was bad. Furthermore there is some serious bad writing in the game. Cerberus, the Illusive Man and Kai Leng for example. On the other hand there are some amazing storyquests like Tutchanka. Graphics looks good. Characters are interesting. Quests overall are (except for some of the side/miniquests) also interesting. Music is great. Overall, a decent game but worse than the previous two.",7,2014-11-11,PC,user
Truth_,"I finally got around to playing Mass Effect 3. When all is said in done, I found it to be a fairly solid game. It's combat was not great, but not awful, either. Similarly, the story was excellent at times, and weak at others. Acquiring a crew, learning the lore of new and old, exploring the galaxy, and upgrading you and your teammates was a fulfilling experience, however, little was improved from Mass Effect 2 to 3. Combat was simple with predictable and unintelligent AI (for the most part). Your companions are not particularly useful and can be /very/ powerful if used well and used often. I played on Hard and it was quite easy, like most shooters. Luckily it wasn't too tedious, however. There are enough breaks inbetween combat, exploration, and dialogue which kept a good pace and felt organic. I thought the story was quite good, and I loved so many of the lines and conversations in the game. A+. Obviously there were some cheesy and not so good ones, but all in all I enjoyed it very much. However, I felt some of the dialogue choices were a bit wonky, some didn't make sense, some gave poor options, and some had silly responses that either Shepherd or the other person didn't make sense to me. In combat, some characters seemed to have a lot more unique/useful/interesting things to say than others, which I largely based my party picks off of (EDI, Garrus, and Liara always have interesting or useful comments or observations). Finally, I'm not a huge fan of being forced to pick one reputation type and sticking with it. I feel unless you do 90%+ in one or the other, you miss out on the best dialogue choices, dialogue results, and other things. Mixing and matching your choices, even if you feel they're the best ones logically or in your own role-play playthrough, give you a worse result and worse game. Note: I cannot comment on Day 1 DLC (which is these days quite common) since I only just got it. I also can't comment on the old ending, as I've only experienced the new one. Lastly, I cannot comment on the multiplayer as I have not played it (but I've heard good things). On the whole I was satisfied with the game, but happy I did not buy it on release.",6,2014-11-05,PC,user
DarkSaborComa,"Every cutscene in this game is amazing, and even though I didn't feel the story as well as I did in Mass Effect 2, there are still moments that really pack a punch. It isn't as good as it's predecessor, but isn't as disappointing as Arkham Origins was. Sometimes I wish this game were just a movie. I've always been far far more invested in each dialogue scene as I was in the action, and it seemed to just slow down for me every time I had to take on another hoard of cannibals.

whitepawn,"This would be better if it wasn't such an obvious cash grab. The game you buy is half the game. Get the other half in installments for $8 here and $20 there.

I thought there was cheese there but it was fine. I also think a trilogy with an actual end is good. A lot of the screaming here is likely because you become attached to Shepard and want to play her in a Mass Effect 4, you want it to keep going because you made her and you like her and you're invested in her. Trilogies are good for movies and books and they can be good for video games too. Let BioWare move on...I'm interested to see what they do after DA is done...they'll need a new adventure trilogy and look at what they've done/learned with their DA and mass effects series.

ysgraithe,"Having been forewarned of the issues with the ending, I downloaded the improved ending DLC as well as all the other DLCs. Firstly, let me tell you that the DLCs improve the game massively, and it easily deserves a 9 at least. Most if not all of the negative reviews are caused by the ending, which the DLC fixes, so no reason not to give the game a higher rating once you get the DLC, (which is available for free). The other DLCs need to be paid for but boy are they great! In short, the DLCs improve the game massively-especially the Citadel DLC, awesome, and I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish.

Pallowin,"This used to be my favorite franchise. I have put at least 500 hours into ME1 and ME2, all in preparation for ME3. I wanted to have the perfect save file ready, so I could see how my choices would add up in ME3. What I got, however, was a rushed mess, that didn't even deliver on half of the promises made. The game knew that it had a lot of knots to tie, relating to the different side missions and characters I had interacted with in my many playthroughs of ME1+2. This was solved mostly by lazily sending an email to you ingame, telling you that ""This char did this, and now he/she is dead"" or ""Hello, I am xxx you helped my with yyy a while back, thanks"" The characters didn't feel like the characters from the first two games, they felt a little ""off"". Like they were written by a different person (which turned out to be correct). This became blatantly obvious the farther I got. I often had the feeling that ""this person would not say this"" or ""this person would not do this"" The zones/planets/places you visited felt small and confined, I felt like I traversed one long corridor with no option to explore or branch off the given path. Decisions you made felt superficial, and I didn't feel like I had an impact on the world, contrary to the two previous games, This was mostly because the game focused on completing old storylines, poorly, instead of creating some new ones as well. The whole game I had a bad feeling about these occurrences, and when I reached the end, the game simply caved in on itself. I could only sit there and stare at the screen completely silent. Then, as something I can only assume was a joke, the DLC message popped up: ""Commander Shepard has become a legend by ending the Reaper threat. Now you can continue to build that legend through further gameplay and downloadable content"" I simply shut the game off, uninstalled Origin, and I haven't touched an EA game since. The fact that I stumbled over this in late 2014 and still feel angry, is a testament to how much this game disappointed me. This game has ruined my love for the two previous ones as well, as I sit back with a ""what's to point"" feeling whenever I feel like playing ME1 or ME2. If you haven't played the Mass Effect series, I would recommend you to only play the first two games, and forget that this stinker exists. ...And lastly, looking at the professional critic score, is a perfect indicator of what is wrong with game journalism today.",4,2014-10-16,PC,user

Kyle2086,"As far as the epic conclusion to the Mass Effect trilogy goes, 3 is a mixed bag. On the one hand, it starts out amazingly, where you feel like the fate of the galaxy is at stake and every race that inhabits it, for better or worse. Unfortunately, after a great start, it stumbles, then falls flat on it's face in the end. If by the end of ME3 you're left wondering what happened, even with the end game DLC, you're not alone. This game could never meet every fan's expectations, and there's no way bioware could have made all the choices the player made over the course of 3 games end in an exponential number of endings, but when it's all said and done, your choices are essentially rendered inconsequential. The game is very playable, and re-playable, and you can easily get your money's worth out of the entertainment values presented here, just don't go into it with high expectations.",8,2014-10-01,PC,user
RimJobson,"Bioware has been progressively dumbing down the immersion felt in the Mass Effect universe, starting with the transition from Mass Effect to Mass Effect 2 and now dealing the killing blow with the final game in this wonderful trilogy. Don't get me wrong, Mass Effect 3 was a solid single-player experience; however, this is not about a ""solid single-player experience"", this is about the third game in a series known for its immersiveness and ability to make you feel empathy for its characters. In this game, that immersion has been diluted to the point of many characters having their purpose in the overall plot made negligible and simply added in to provide a cameo for the fans of other Mass Effect fiction (see: James Vega), and this unfortunately includes our protagonist: the one character you were supposed to feel connected with given the game's status as an ""RPG"". Sure, some of this was solved by DLC, but the simple fact that we're talking about ""solving problems"" for a game that spent a sizeable amount of time in development means that there is a problem. But, that is all about the immersion. The crippling point of this game - for I had foolishly thought that the game could still be saved - was not the lack of immersion, it was the poorly developed plotline that had great beginning. Having been built-up by the first two games in the trilogy, I expected that the pacing and ultimate resolution of the plot would not leave me with a sour taste in my mouth as it did. The plotline is developed in a ridiculously cliché manner, to the point that it feels like I was watching a series of overly edited cinematics with gameplay only serving as a buffer between viewings. Is it a bad thing per se? No, but this takes us back to this game's position as the third game in its series, meaning that it has a certain standard to live up to and a certain method of gameplay that a player of such a series would expect. The new method of delivering the plot is disjointing at best and game-ruining at worst, with me leaning closer to the latter end of the spectrum. Finally, we get to the ending (with me addressing the vanilla ending, as I should be). While not absolutely terrible, it does leave enormous gaps of ""What happened?"" moments that should NOT be happening with the closer of a series. Sure, inference and speculation are alright if another game was to be expected, but the this is the final game of the series that would star Commander Shepard, so this game - as the other 2 provided - should have given us a sense of finality even if it was not decisively final. While Leviathan fixed many of the holes that were exhaustively mentioned by reviewers, there should not have been anything to fix (refer to my DLC rant). Tl;dr - The game was decent as a single-player experience, awful as a multiplayer experience, atrocious as a Mass Effect game, and the apotheosis of plot failure as a Mass Effect trilogy finisher. Mass Effect 3 made me experience a thought that should never be experienced with an RPG, much less one as wonderful as Mass Effect: ""Do I really want to play this again?""",5,2014-09-27,PC,user
Chr0m3,"Mass Effect 3 is a phenomenal experience, and a fitting end to the Mass Effect trilogy. The stakes have never been higher, the action never as intense, and by the end of the game, when you arrive back at Earth with every fleet you've gathered and finally bring the fight to the Reapers, it would be hard to not at least cheer for the Galaxy that you've known and loved for three games, finally putting aside old grudges and conflicts to work together as a united force. Bioware also hasn't held back in the emotional scenes of Mass Effect 3, from the opening scene where a Reapers destroyer mercilessly destroys a shuttle escaping with a child on board, to the deaths of many main characters and the nightmares that Shepard goes through, this game really pulled at my heartstrings. Of course, there is the ending, which caused much controversy for its abrupt end without providing resolution to long time fans of the series, however as I only played the game after the release of the Extended Cut DLC, I was satisfied with the ending, it was not the best way to end the series, but it was fine in my honest opinion, and overall, Mass Effect 3 was one of the most amazing and compelling games I have ever had the pleasure of playing.",9,2014-09-24,PC,user

Maybe I have just been spoiled by recent gaming highs (TLOU, GTAV, BF4) but where is the quality this time? Where are 2012 level AAA character animations, voice emotion and smart dialogue.

rmcfc1988,I can sum this game up in one sentence....... Great game terrible ending. Mass effect 3 takes the refined combat of ME2 and adds further improvements out of the entire trilogy I feel that ME3 has the best and most balanced combat system. The main storyline is strong right up until priority sanctuary where it takes a steep nosedive. Overall Bioware plays to its strengths ME3 has a strong cast of memorable characters and a meaningful storyline that makes ME3 a nearly perfect end to Shepard's stroyline. That said ME3 does have its problems 1) Fetch missions are quite lazy and feel like an afterthought to the campaign 2) Poor animations at times characters will jerk and do physically impossible things head twisting being a memorable moment 3)Galaxy at war was not fleshed out and had no meaningful impact other than a red/green/blue ending (expanded on slightly with the Extended cut). 4) Kai Leng was poorly implemented and felt like a joke. Easily one of the more frustrating moments of the game given that he is made out to be your equal but is laughably stupid most of the time which makes his cutscene wins over you incredibly frustrating. 5) A more personal one for me was the treatment of Ashley Williams she had just two scenes and was only usable after the first half of the game. I've had this game since release but have chosen to review not to give it the score I think it deserves and not one based on the disappointment I had after release. The reason I can give it a 9/10 is due to the fact that the problems only represent 10% of the game and as such I enjoyed the other 90% enough to give it a good score. This is a great game and even though I believe it deserves a 9/10 I cannot help but focus on the negative aspects of the **** has to be the worst ending to a game that I have ever played.

PresCthulhu,"I think this one is best out of the 3 games. The game play is refined and engaging, the combat is very good, I really like the multiplayer and played countless hours with it, the story is very nice, I see tons of cameos and my decisions reflecting back from the first game and they don't feel forced at all. The buildup, the tension, the writing, the voice acting, the graphics are all brilliant. I deducted 2 points because: 1st obviously cash-grab DLCs that feel like cutout content (day 1 removed character, important story DLCs like Leviathan), 2nd the ending is a disgrace even with the extended cut. It was okay I mean, but the whole buildup for the final confrontation felt utterly pointless and I felt I was cheated in a way. I like how the company reflected on it (extended cut, free DLCs), but still there was no official apology. My conclusion: this is a really great game and extremely worth it, but be prepared for some letdown in the end...",8,2014-07-07,PC,user

Buu,"Mass Effect 3 seems like a experiment to get everything present at Video-Games 101 and throw it out of the window. Even the usual ""Boss Fight"" was sold as ""too videogamey"" idea and cut from it. Things that don't work include poorly designed introduction, quests that are gotten without indication or interaction with NPCs, and always end in a mini-game of scan-and-run fetch. Inventory still horrible to manage, and quest details and progress are inexistent. The great voice actors from the previous games are faded by the bad story and cheesy lines. In fact most of the older characters return completely ""out-of-character"", to progress a story with lots of violence and deaths. Even classic features from the series are defaced. The dialog wheel doesn't follow the classic options of decisions, investigation and actions anymore, and the amount of auto-dialog is significant. Besides that, most of the history is preset and don't change based on your decisions and what changes are only showed as scores, changing nothing in the actual game, until the very end, when you're just told that had a consequence. Not showed, just TOLD. DLCs still being sold only by Bioware points, which never change price. Thing that cause the each of larger DLCs, which are just a fraction of the game, to cost even MORE than the base game. And the worst feature of the game was the ending. One ending that retroactively ruined the 2 great game that precede it. An ending that was included in literature college courses as subject of how to not deliver a narrative. Mass Effect was once called the Star Trek of this generation, but this third game was so revolting that made writers from ""the Next Generation"" to rise their voices and protest to what was made with the story. It's an ending that will live forever in infamy and is revolting in many levels. If you're a fan of the franchise and loved the first two games, but never touched this third instance, refrain yourself, and consider the second game the end of Shepard's tale. There is always hope that in the future the IP will fall in more competent hands, and they will consider ME3 never happened, and write a proper end for this Epic.",0,2014-06-17,PC,user

Charlemagne,"It's mediocre as a movie but complete fails as a game. It's the kind of game where I would rather the game just play itself and I watch (twice - once good guy, once bad guy). There is no real freedom, you are on a railroad, and now and then there is a fork (a choice)... but usually the game designer has decided that some choices are less valid than others and will punish you for making them, basically forcing their moral world view on you. And the rhyme and reason of it is quite irrational - the game rewards you for picking fights with strangers doing things the designers expect you to disapprove of, but punishes you for not committing genocide of the last of some ant creature. It's fitting that it has such a bad ending, because the entire thing was bad. Most levels offer no freedom of movement, you are funneled by invisible walls, and have fixed objections that you must complete. Which might be right for a racing car game, but not in what is suppose to be an 'adventure' game... an 'adventure' game where you are not free to actually adventure. It fails as an adventure game because of the lack of freedom, and it fails as an action game because of the lack of depth to the combat... leaving the player with nothing rewarding except a mediocre story that the game demands you jump through hoops to see. I didn't play it through, I watched what I missed on YouTube.",0,2014-06-02,PC,user

cigarillored,"Forget all the crap you hear about the ending; if you want to see all your favorite characters walking off into the sunset, hand-in-hand, this is not the game for you. On the other hand, if you want to play a game that engages you from start to finish, has you make some truly difficult moral decisions, and makes you care about who lives and who dies, then Mass Effect 3 it is. Honestly, I don't get the hate. The ending is perfectly fitting. The game mechanics are fantastic, very polished, and rarely monotonous. Enjoy it for what it is, a perfectly good way to end the series. Mass Effect 2 will always be the better game, but for me this is not the great big turd some people want it to be. Considering the amount of sub-standard fare that gets spewed out by big game companies these days, the kind of re-heated **** we see regurgitated by Activision every few months, we should be glad this is actually a decent game.",7,2014-05-16,PC,user

In the original mass effect we had these deep different characters with altering personalities that you could converse with, now all we have is broadly drawn characters like every alien in the galaxy wants to be like the rock or vin diesel or meghan fox.....

For the 3rd episode,(played with all dlcs,no multiplayer),it's has really something in it. I felt something after every big decision,i felt I'm in a hurry,it **** me in. There won't be another game soon,which makes me feel guilty for decimating a whole race,or makes me play the whole trilogy again because of it.

In ME 2 an Arsai told me the rachni "" Would burn clean the sky."" I thought this meant they would come save me when things seemed hopeless. In other words they were the key to defeating the Reapers. Bioware ""fixed the problem"" when they killed most of them off by the Reapers. When I first read about Mass Effect Bioware had just finished Knights of the Old Republic. They were making a trilogy where your actions in all three games would affect the ending in third one. Bioware lied to me to the tune of 160 bucks. They only gave one ending with four options. In order to have your actions truly affect the ending, a happy ending has to be possible. The extended cut DLC is nothing more then damage control and selling Mass Effect 4. For me though, Bioware has noway to correct the mess they made. I can only hope they pissed off enough people so there is no Mass Effect 5.",2,2014-03-31,PC,user

Unfortunately, the ending will make you puzzled at the fact of why you couldn't do something different. The ending will most likely abandon the series as a lost cause.

Some people might understand it, some won't. Still, a great game and deserves the respect of being a good ME game.

FatherKarras,"Certainly a mixed bag, Mass Effect 3 is a game which is disappointing in a multitude of aspects, ranging from the bland action orientated combat, massive plot holes and poorly written characters and quite possibly one of the worst endings I have ever experienced in gaming. After a tense and emotional introduction, the game quickly goes down hill. Shepard, a character whom you define, is whisked away on an epic space adventure to save the universe after the Reapers finally made it to the galaxy. Somehow, this entire time no one had listened to Shepard, even though there has been excellent reasons to, now everyone is boned. After a game of boring combat (having chose my Infiltrator class who has been leveled up since the first game, I could one shot almost anytime of enemy in the game with a rifle), characters making stupid decisions and a forced character by the name of Kei-Lang, you finally reach the end... And oh boy... Did it ****. Terrible ending aside, the game had some genuine sad moments, such as the deaths of some of my favorite characters... But overall, a weak passage and pals in comparison to the amazing previous installments. Positives: Fun multiplayer. Multiple/difficult choices. Genuine sad moments. Great soundtrack. Ends multiple story lines and you get to say your final goodbyes. Negatives: Boring combat. Plotholes... Plotholes EVERYWHERE. Poorly written side characters. Vague motives. Horrible quest tracker. And that ending.... THAT ENDING. Overall: 6",6,2014-03-11,PC,user

Troublewalking,"I got this game free for my Origin account as part of the debacle that was the release of SimCity. To make up for that mess, Origin gave us a choice of one free game. I chose Mass Effect 3. Up till then I had Mass Effect 2, and Mass Effect 1. Though I have to admit I was never really a fan of Mass Effect 1, as I didn't discover it until way past it's due date. And by then the once top of the line graphics were horrendous to deal with. However, I think Mass Effect 2 explains why so many people love this series. For it's time the graphics were amazing. The mini games which added to the fun were classic. You got to chose good or bad options. You got to choose your class and skill set, and upgrade as you saw fit. The team member stories were pretty good. And it was just a solid game. So when I got Mass Effect 3, I had high expectations. However the reason I never purchased the game before was that I heard EA had dropped the ball on Mass Effect 3. Now there are certainly things that were disappointing about Mass Effect 3. But these disappointments need to be tampered by whether your a fan of the series or not. Obviously disappointed fans of the series would give this game much harsher than needed reviews of the game. Which needs to be kept in mind, because if I had never played a Mass Effect game. Mass Effect 3 would be considered a 10 to me. But seeing the drop in quality from iMass Effect 3 compared to Mass Effect 2 I can understand some of the fans strong feelings against the game. And is the main reason I give the game only an 8. In short Mass Effect 3 just is missing some of the core things which made the Mass Effect series so great. The mini games were gone. They tweaked the classes, mostly in a bad way. They all but eliminated the companions or team member side stories. They didn't really have tie ins with the team members you grew to love in the other stories. And then to add insult to injury the ending seems like EA was trying to put an abrupt end to the series. So you need to understand that the majority of the bad reviews are from loyal fans of the series who felt they were robbed by the direction EA chose to go with the game for Mass Effect 3. Again as a stand alone game for someone new to the franchise it is definitely worth getting. But as the 3rd in the series it unapologetically tries to rip the heart of the franchise out and stomp on it. They probably imagined they would win all kinds of awards for a hardcore story. But instead made a lot of fans unhappy. Fortunately EA tried to do some face saving and put in some patches that allow for some happy endings. Though it seems like you have to farm points to make that happen. And that takes away from the story. And story is one of the things Mass Effect is great at. So even though Mass Effect 3 is not nearly as good as Mass Effect in my opinion. It is still a solid game. Just terribly disappointing if your a fan of the franchise. The game is good enough to keep enjoying. I have all 3 on my computer. And purchased a cheap 1-3 Xbox 360 version. Also if your a fan of KOTOR the games are very similar. It's the freedom to choose the way you want to play, and the way your skills level up. Along with story, companion stories and fun mini games that makes these EA games so beloved.",8,2014-03-06,PC,user
rhymesmatter,0...There is nothing else you can give this travesty and attempt from EA to leech money out of their fans not thinking about the consequences.

Dalesworth,"It's not perfect, but Mass Effect 3 is a fantastic game. It improved on ME2 in several ways and took some steps back in others, but at its core, I feel like it's a slightly different kind of game. 2 had a very personal and intimate feel, assembling an elite team for a deadly mission. 3 is much more grand and sweeping in its scale and scope, and therefore has a less focused story. The gameplay has seen a steady sense of improvement throughout the series (remember how awkward the first one was to actually play?) and the RPG elements make a more pronounced appearance in the third game, though it is still largely a shooter with some skill progression. The shooting mechanics are more fluid and the weapons and abilities more diverse. The sound design and voice acting are both fantastic (mostly), as is the art design. As for the writing, I feel like the writers manage the the more intimate and moment-to-moment writing more effectively than the large, overarching plot. the way the Normandy's crew interact with each other and move around on board makes the ship feel much more alive than ever before. There were plenty of nice touches, from meeting old friends to little in-jokes and fan service. Unfortunately it seems like the team wrote themselves into a corner with all of the branching decisions in past games, and not all of them paid off in meaningful ways. And finally, there's the ending. I didn't like it. I thought it was a cop-out and honestly it made next to no sense and was very thematically different from the rest of the story. It was unsatisfying and some of the fan-made theories that cropped up afterwards were much better. However, I respect the creative team's position and think that DEMANDING a new ending is childish and a sign of ""gamer entitlement."" The extended cut made the ending as good as it could have been without fundamentally changing it and in the end, it really is about the journey and not the destination. I had a blast playing though this game as well as the whole series. ten minutes of unsatisfying drivel at the end is a bummer, but this is still one of my favourite series of all time, and I wont let that ruin the hundreds of hours that I've poured into it. All in all, this is a Mass Effect game and I can look past awkward design choices and some poor writing to just enjoy the ride and hope for more in the future.",9,2014-02-27,PC,user

dyspeptic,"Played: Jan 2014 Pros: + Actually wraps up the Mass Effect story arc + Inventory compromises between simplicity (ME2) and variety (ME1) + Additional Ending content is free Cons: - Character models don’t look updated from ME2 - Some items are highly missable and a bug seems to keep some from appearing in a store if missed I was introduced to the series through Mass Effect 2, which offered some significant streamlining to make gameplay more fun than its predecessor. I eventually played ME1, but based on reviews I’d read I didn’t want to splash out $60 for ME3 so it was some time before the price came down to what I was comfortable paying. I’m glad I waited. While the story arc is completed with reasonable effectiveness, it features at least one prominent fallacy that I found somewhat insulting to my intelligence. After some public outcry, Bioware released some (free) additional content to explain the results of your end-game choice-and it’s a good thing it’s free, since it adds about 30sec of content. On the other hand, this series ending compares favorably compared with the non-endings featured in the string of Assassin’s Creed games by developer Ubisoft (up to you to decide if that comparison actually says anything). Gameplay mechanics are mostly solid, featuring a more flexible inventory that that presented in ME1, but still simplified enough that it doesn’t feel like a loot game: there are only about 5 options for each weapon type. The player can carry and use any type of weapon desired, however “heavy” weapons (anything not pistol or SMG) severely curtail use of powers. I played this on the default difficulty setting (apparently equivalent to the “Hard” setting on ME2) and only died a few times; even on death the checkpoint system allowed me to return to action and complete the game+90% of sidequests in about 50 hours. Relevant to gameplay is the occurance of “missable” items, which are supposed to appear in a special store if you fail to pick them up. Unfortunately, through some kind of bug or other problem, these items did not appear in store for me (I looked them up online to try to figure out how to complete the remaining quests). The rewards would have been small, but it is annoying to be missing a feature that is supposed to come with the game. There were a few things that I found even more disappointing. The character models feature the same faces and hairstyles as in previous games, and don’t appear to be any better rendered than previously. In the same vein, the pre-rendered cutscenes look as though they came straight from 2005 and it is something of a relief when they end and you are allowed to return to your machine's real-time rendering. In short: the graphics don’t seem to have improved at all since ME2, though why this would be the case is a mystery to me. IN SUMMARY: ME3 is a decent game to pick up if you like the idea of a shooter/RPG hybrid with a team. It is certainly worth the $15 or so EA games is currently charging, but still suffers from some pitfalls and you shouldn't pay more for it.",7,2014-02-12,PC,user

I do admit that I cried in the ending, but at the time I thought I just got the bad ending and that I had to make better choices next time. But nope, it turned out that that wasn't the case. Like so many others, I was left hugely disappointed. But after having accepted the fact that that's the way it ends, I have seen this game in a whole new positive light. I also want to mention the official soundtracks. They're simply amazing, full of emotions and tension. Overall, Mass Effect 3 may not be the best in the series, but it's certainly not a bad game.

amorphousblob,"The good and bad of Mass Effect 3: Good: 1. Vastly improved levelling system that gives a noticeable upgrade with every skill point added. 2. Much more weapon variety. 3. Good weapon modding. Bad: 1. Terrible controls which rely on one button for virtually every action. Attempting to use an object while moving often results in the character launching themselves across the room or getting out of cover, also no crouch button means the character sometimes stands up in the middle of fire-fights. 2. Stupid ally AI. Allies are happy to stand out of cover while getting shot at, disappear in the middle of fights or refuse to shoot at enemies. 3. Levelling is way too fast. In the first mission for example I increased my level three times. 4. Side missions are boring. The majority of side missions involve jumping to a sector and right clicking a few times. These are necessary for game completion and a real chore. 5. Player interaction is limited. Much crew interaction does not occur in cut-scenes and player has no control over their own responses. Dialog during missions is within cut-scenes but player still does not get to choose as many responses as in previous games. A Cynical person might assume this problem is due to laziness on the writers/animators part. 6. Non player characters are boring. Character development appears to have taken a back seat in this game as both new and returning characters have little to say. The only interesting development I caught was jokers relationship but I managed to miss its resolution. 7. Decisions in previous games appear to have little impact. 8. Terrible level design. Levels are designed in a boxy arena style and clearly just recycled multiplayer maps, recycled so lazily as to have loads of ammo caches everywhere. 9. Mandatory multiplayer. In order to get a good ending player is required to play multiplayer battles. This effectively precludes players with poor internet from experiencing some of the single player content. 10. Dull, dull, dull combat. Most of the interesting enemies appear to have been removed: In combat I have mostly just faced a load of dudes with progressively bigger guns. 11. Plot points from previous games are ignored. Shepard appears to answer to the alliance now when he was a spectre in the previous game for example. There are tonne more issues but really it all boils down to this: In attempting to broaden their customer base Bioware have turned the most exciting and deep RPG/FPS ever into a complete mess with little appeal to lovers of either genre. Both of the prequels I have played many times, including all the DLC, but ME3 was only good enough to get me to play until about five minutes into the final mission once. A huge disappointment. (also my characters run animation makes her look like she has sh** her pants)",3,2014-01-25,PC,user
gobSIDES,"An absolutely terrible end to a great series. Reeks of a company trying to expand the target market of their game at the worse possible time and without taking proper concern as to the affect it would have on the game. Many of the original choices and decisions you make in previous game are not addressed and completely forgotten. The introduction of new character undermine existing ones and have zero depth. Gameplay is largely the same though let down by very far behind the times graphics and laughable animations. Bioware made a power play for the market when joining with EA and releasing 3 utterly abysmal games in TOR, ME3 and Dragon Age 2. These have pretty much condemned their reputation with the gaming community and undone over a decade of hard work from the company. Sad and poor.",2,2014-01-18,PC,user
COMThing,"Excellent game with much a more fluid combat experience than the previous 2 games. The Good: - Customisation is much improved over ME2. The number of weapons available has been greatly increased to roughly 8 per category and the upgrade system includes weapon mods/attachments. Amour is very customisable with interchangeable parts and a much more user-friendly customisation interface than ME2 - Combat is much more fluid and ammunition isn't really a problem (no more 15 rounds total carrying capacity for a certain shotgun) compared to ME2. The addition of heavy melee is another factor to consider when choosing your class and adds more combos. - Dialogue and voice acting is very well done overall, often times making up for the number of plot holes - Probably the best soundtrack of the series The Bad: - Lacks a decent inventory system: Picking up 1 weapon and being able to equip everybody with it makes it seem more shallow than ME1. In addition, not being able to sell items of any sort takes away from the role-playing experience - Side missions have very little reward and offer very little replay value. When they do have a useful function, they usually end up being tedious and are too simple to actually feel like a mission (Sometimes very close to being as short as the cutscene and dialogue that introduces the mission) - The plot has many holes in it and none of the DLCs fix these issues; rather just add more holes. Skip this game if you require a somewhat believable story. SIDE NOTE - there is a community edited cinematic ending that greatly improves the experience - Squad AI is still terrible and the limited interactions you can do with them just makes them a distraction so you don't die too quickly",8,2014-01-12,PC,user

stern,"In this third and final release, slowly the narrative coherence of Mass Effect eroded, until near the end, at a fast pace it completly crumbled. In ME2 you could say that the villains were unjustified and meaningless in a narrative sense, you could say that choices, events and positions were forced into your character and many were literally asspulls, but at least ME2 provided plenty of well written and thoughtful content in the form of loyality missions for example, to couterbalance this. In ME3 there is no such thing and what starts as a contrived, average to bad story, end as a complete mess with giant holes where obviously the writers or devs didn't know what they were doing. Or if you played Deus Ex 1, a classical and mind-blowing game unlike ME3, you'll simply know that ME3 ending is a rip off, out of thone, feel and athmosphere from the rest of ME series and even from the rest of the third game itself, not addressing any of the questions and propositions that the ending should address. Mission after mission asspulls are thrown at the player and they are supposed to contain core elements of the narrative without any connection with the previous games. ""Oh, you know, we found the ancient plans to this super-weapon, we don't even know what it does, but it's our only hope! Why didn't I mention these ancient plans before? I don't know"", ""Oh, the genophage was stabilished as a necessary evil, was even fully approached in a previous game? Too bad, let's use it again in the narrative in a total different way!"", ""You reproggammed heretic Geths? Nah, it didn't change anything!"", ""Forget Ilos and the Conduit, forget Haelstrom!"" and so on, with even poorer resolutions than before, sometimes even with implausible forever happy conclusions, where magically everything worked out for everyone and butterflies and rainbows are in the sky. As for other aspects, some can be praised: they finally fleshed out powers, cooldowns and shields/armors/barriers, even adding power combos, making the gameplay as a pure adept or as an enginner very interesting. Too bad the game fail to explain this and you are supposed to search in the internet for a guide to which power detonates the other and what defense is vulnerable to what power (for example, energy drain is useless against armor, carnage is useless against shield, etc). The combat system is finally fun and interesting if you have patience to micromanage your squadmates, because they are useless otherwise and never use the proper powers if left by themselves. Other aspects must be criticized: the missions journal is confusing and doesn't match the missions name in the galaxy map, the weapons customization is dumbed down and mostly useless, upgrading equipment is a chore, side missions are utterly boring and repetitive, re-using multiplayer maps and the same mission model (active console A, hold postion B, etc), there are plenty and I mean plent of bugs even so long after release, sometimes advancing the main plot makes side missions expire and several, several characters are out of character or at least with very poorly written lines. The game feels short and I wonder if this is because they decided to focus on multiplayer instead. Unlike ME2, I can't recommend any DLC except for Javik. Citadel is cringe worthy and apparently made for 15 years old, Leviathan is stupid, inspired by movies such as Abyss and presents more implausible asspulls than answers, Omega is boring and will make you skip full dialogues out of boredom. ME3 is so bad that makes ME1 a master piece in comparison, it'll age bad and be a waste of your time. I recommend reading the relevant plot in wikis and skip this game. Too bad they are making a 4th installation, I predict a even worse product.",3,2014-01-08,PC,user
ssenginss,I did not played this before extended cut expansion DLC so i don't know old ending. The game is a fair Mass effect game its content may not be as rich as ME2 but it is fun to play as a continuation.,9,2014-01-05,PC,user
m8cct,"Mass Effect 3 gets a bad rap, I'm here to say that it is the best of all the Mass Effect games. ME3 combines the best elements of the first two installments: it takes the vastly improved game play of Mass Effect 2 and makes it even more fluid, more stream lined and more exciting. I appreciated the slightly expanded level-up system and weapons choices, even if still lacking from the ME1 days. I didn't care for the graphics upgrade between 1 and 2, but I appreciated the overhaul in this one. Story-wise, ME3 succeeded where its predecessor failed. The fact that BioWare decided not to encore 15 hours of utterly unengaging ""team building"" was a great start. The plot feels less like a grocery list, and more like an actual moving timeline, where Shepard really is interacting with the galaxy at large and taking actions that effect it. The old crew is mostly back, and the Normandy is an alliance ship again. All is right with the world. I didn't struggle to find a reason to care. This game rediscovers the clarity of purpose that the series began with. I hear grumblings about how the Mass Effect storyline simply became too linear, and that complaint might be valid. I never said the game was perfect. I still prefer linearity to whatever the hell ME2 was supposed to be. It might not be very RPG-like with the little things it does, but it is still very much an RPG in the bigger picture. You made a lot of choices in 1 and 2 that are going to directly affect 3 and you're going to make more choices in 3. It's easy to forget how many branching story lines there are a play in this series and the kind of effort BioWare put into making sure the player feels fully invested in whichever one they might find themselves in, and as always, the script and voice acting is top notch. Are the last 15 minutes of the game unworthy of the Mass Effect series? Yes, it's all true. It's sad to see that the ending completely lacked the thought and care that the rest of the story got throughout the saga, but the ending has it where it counts; the final mission is difficult and thrilling, even if the bits following it fail to win hearts.",9,2014-01-02,PC,user

ROK1992,"Personally, I do not normally read any reviews on games before playing it as it may give me a biased perspective on it. However this is the first time I totally regret not reading any reviews on ME3 before playing it. Although I admit i've been hearing countless praises for its prior titles. Mass Effect 3 was my introduction to the series as I have not played the prior games yet (and I must admit, ME3 is totally preventing me from playing it). Im sure ME fans know that this game has its own very unique atmosphere while containing many moral and philosophical twists. I was immediately hooked on to the game thinking this might be one of my favorite games in my life. To be honest, ME3 Gameplay was pretty good at the least above average in my opinion. It was very interesting, entertaining until the end where (keep in mind, ME3 was an introduction to Mass Effect for me) it just became flat out abysmal and insulting. Non, and I mean NON of my hard thought decisions throughout the game even mattered in the end and I can't imagine what it would have been like to the players who spent so much time on previous titles. Im not sure what the writers were thinking but when I heard that damned space kid at the end telling me the few options I have, I knew they made a BIG mistake. Simply said, the ending ruined the game 100%. Im afraid the ending was one of the saddest and most pathetic close ups in video game history and I offer my sympathy to those who played throughout the whole series.",5,2013-12-13,PC,user
morten_doboj,"I really enjoyed the first Mass Effect as I had almost all other Bioware titles, most of all the really immersing story. The story elements were continued in ME2, although the progress was halted quite a bit. Sadly Mass Effect 3 is without a doubt the weakest in the series. Even though the gameplay is a bit better than the previous games, and the story as engaging as ever, the ending ruined the whole trilogy for me. This is the first time that I ever stopped playing a series altogether because of a single flaw, but what a flaw.",2,2013-12-12,PC,user

I loved Mass effect 1 and though some people disliked mass effect 2 I thought the story was good enough to follow through and keep me entertained. Mass effect 3 has no redeeming qualities. The game play and physics are clunky, the graphics very outdated, the cover system gets you killed more often than it saves you. The Reapers, who are supposed to be the most devastating enemy we've ever seen, are so easy to take it, its laughable. I could go on and on like this, it really doesn't have anything going for it at all. If you want a good 3rd person shooter go for the dead space series, don't waste your time with this. I give it a 2/10 in honor of mass effect 1 and 2.",2,2013-12-12,PC,user

Gingerbread_Man,"Loved the first two games. Was nothing but disappointed with this one. Combat felt almost identical to the second, and was fine. Outside of that, everything was different. The characters the second game spent so long building felt largely absent except for cameos. The choices made in previous games had absolutely no noticeable impact. The lore from the first game felt completely abandoned by this point, and the replacement arc was nowhere near the scope or impact. I'm not sure if they completely changed the project director by the third game, but it felt like the someone was writing the ending to someone else's story. Wasn't very good in any aspect.",3,2013-12-11,PC,user

MarsLars,"It's been a year since this game was released, and still people cannot get over the ending. If I ask someone if they've ever played Mass Effect, the answer is usually a no, because they're uncultured swine, or because ""The ending of 3 ****, so I never started."" I am truly disappointed with BioWare's fans. This studio gave us one of the greatest sci-fi stories (and universes) of all time. It was lauded by critics and consumers alike. People developed actually feelings toward these characters. All of this is overshadowed by an ending that disappointed. Mass Effect 3 is a good game. There, I said it! Come at me Internet! Yes, it is a little more action/shooter oriented than the previous two, but hey, it's the third installment of a trilogy. This game was aimed at hard core fans (don't you dare disagree!) and those who were breaking in to the franchise, so it's obvious that they would want to up the ante, to appeal to those action game junkies (Thanks, Activision.). But why, WHY all the hate? Please everyone, don't penalize the experience just because of a conclusion that you didn't enjoy. People would've been distraught not matter what they did. I feel like most of these negative reviews are people just getting wrapped up in the internet fervor, not actual, unbiased reviews. I personally loved the ending up through the final choice, though I feel the results should have been expanded, but guess what? They did! BioWare appeased the masses with a free-of-charge expansion that provides better clarity. Anyways, what I'm trying to say is, if, by chance, someone reads this, I hope I can inform some lucky person with an interest in RPG's to not worry and to have fun, to see through all the bitterness. I can sleep better at night knowing I introduced someone to a new, exciting world. Thanks BioWare, and Reader, ENJOY!",9,2013-11-26,PC,user

avrell,"Storytelling, RPG elements and dialogue have all disintegrated a significant degree since ME2. Any illusion of some greater adventure is no longer there. You have an L shaped corridor after another to clear of enemies. With above in mind, this game can only be seen as a cover shooter such as Gears of War. Considering how other game elements have been either abandoned, simplified or streamlined, it is curious how clumsy and void of fun the shoot em up bits are. Nothing about moving and controlling Shepard feels intuitive. Decision to cram taking cover and sprinting behind same button results in plenty of mid combat situations where you really have no idea what will happen when you press the lottery button. ME3 is essentially a clumsy cover shooter among others. I would not recommend this game to anyone. I am amazed meta score among reviewers is as high as it is.",3,2013-11-18,PC,user

KotorFan3231,"KotorFan3231-This is definitely one of the best games i have ever played, and personally one of my favorites of all time. The story and characters are above average in fact they are the best i have ever seen in any game to date. There is so much emotion in the dialogue, the action is intense, well presented, and cinematic. The choices your character makes are more impact full. There is one instance in the game i won't spoil for anyone but it involves the Geth, and Tali, and one of the choices made me feel so much emotion i almost cried. Fortunately i ran into very little glitches. My personal favorite character from this game other than commander Shepard is The Illusive Man voice by Martin Sheen, he is well voiced, and character is well written. Now the only other problem with the game that i found was there were less companions, but each were interesting so that didn't bother me that much. For the people who say the ending ruined the game it didn't yes the original ending did not solve much it was just inconclusive but did not ruin the whole game. The ending did not interfere with my experience because overall the writing was extremely strong. There is a massive amount of content in this game. It took me 30+ hours.

I disagree with some of the other posts, in that I think the end choices are fine if the game didn't seem like it ended so abruptly without a lot of explanation. I was left Googling what the endings meant after I finished the game and I don't feel like I should have to do that.

Nimbus1701,"Bioware promised too much with Mass Effect 3, and delivered an average shooter that was on-par with DeadSpace3. This is not an atrocious game. It's just average. Mass Effect 3's biggest problem is Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2. If this were a standalone production with a modular story I can imagine people would be more understanding. It had a lot to live up to but Bioware knew it didn't need to create a brilliant game to get the sales. In contrast to Mass Effect 2's cinematic rendered custscenes, ME3 only offers in-game cutscenes. The most notable problem in the character models are the eyes most human characters have a lifeless stare and feel like animated mannqueins. Environment and alien characters are however, very good. Combat is a tad nauseating at the start. It plays like DeadSpace, and differently to the previous two games. Many will feel that they're missing 40% of their screen to the large OTS-Character model. Ironically, one of the most contrversial features of the game, the ""optional"" multiplayer component, turns out to be better than expected. It may be annoying at the start, but you find yourself enjoying it more than the campaign storyline. I won't need to discuss the ""endings"" and the ""choice"" personally I found these issues to be secondary and would have been forgivable if I wasn't playing a rendition of Deadspace. It's difficult to understand why so many reviewers have marked this up in the 80s. It's definitely a reasonable shooter but not one for the books.",6,2013-10-05,PC,user
Pantheon,"Luckily this is a very small sample size of the people out there who have purchased/played ME3 because the rating is ridiculous. The game is nowhere near as bad as some people have made it out to be and the idea that someone can give it a 0 or a 1 or 2 is quite absurd (giving it a 10 might be just as absurd). I have a feeling that the people who so liberally hand out these low ratings do so for most every game they play. Now I played this AFTER the release of the extended cut, so in that light I'll say the following: The ending(s) made sense. A lot of the criticisms directed at the game because of the ending are borne from erroneous assumptions the various results of which were more dependent on your final effective military score than the actual choice you made, although obviously each choice resulted in some different outcomes for squad mates, people and the universe short term. Now for what I didn't like. 1) The game is still buggy, even over a year after its release. Origin let's you download a game that isn't even patched, so if you buy the game make sure you find the last patch for it this way you will avoid some of the bugs. I should note that EA/Origin ""help"" even missed this fact when called upon to resolve certain issues. 2) You almost have to play multiplayer in order to get the ""so-called"" best ending. I say multiplayer should never have an effect on single player. 3) Shepard still runs on 2 legs like an Ape and is about as graceful as an elephant, that violates my aesthetic appreciation of the game. More importantly though, ""movement"" around the playing field is clunky at best. 4) Side quests are truly uninspiring and the whole ""scan the planet"" to find an artifact is pretty lame. 5) Dialogue in general isn't quite as good as the ME1 or ME2, but not that bad. AND 6) Too many scripted cinematic events and Shepard is sometimes limited in response (and possibly out of character depending on YOUR Shepard. There are of course other issues (some involving Origin policies, etc.), but the total sum of all these issues (including those listed above) don't detract TOO heavily from the story/experience. It's still a fun ride and I give it a solid 8. Would have liked to give it a 9, but won't in deference to ME1 and ME2 but I suspect that's almost always the case with sequels to real good games, it's tough to surpass them as the novelty of their created universe wears off and expectations regarding how things should be and how things should be ""ended"" grow with each passing act/installment.",8,2013-10-05,PC,user
Isengrim,"Disappointment, is the word I would sum this game up with. Mass Effect 3, being a last game in a ME trilogy abandons most of the things that made Mass Effect 1 or 2 so successful. The story of this game, revolving around a mysterious alien device nobody knows anything about is full of plotholes and irrationalities. The gameplay is an improved version of Mass Effect 2, which still abandons most of RPG qualities as it's predecessor did. If that wasn't bad enough, Bioware decided to strip the player out of choices and if there is any they consequences are very similar making the choice itself meaningless. The characters and the world respond to every dialogue option in a very similar way making the whole Paragon/Renegade morality system totally worthless. While a player can import a save from the Mass Effect 2, he/she have to be aware that it doesn't make much of a difference, as possibly dead characters from Mass Effect 2 are replaced on the spot with another new/old character without any noteworthy consequence. There is no choice which mission you want to do, unlike in Mass Effect 1/2, here you just jump from one main mission to the other, linearly going forward to maybe the most disappointing ending in history of videogames. Bad writing, lack of logic, lack of choices and consequences means that this game isn't what it is advertised to be. Add annoying control scheme on PC and you have one of the worst game I have ever played and certainly the most disappointing one. Only redeeming quality of this game is it's soundtrack.

Now dos the Arrival DLC give some crap intro to the next game? Yes. Does it matter that they wanted to explain it at all and release several online and magazine based articles detailing the events for those who didn't want to play? Also yes. They wanted to take the intense Third Person shooting that we saw in Mass Effect 2 and the more heavily driven RPG that we saw in Mass Effect, they then added meaningful weapon customization, upgraded cover, armor, and shield elements, and spiked the difficult. After playing ME3 on hardcore ME2 insanity was a picnic. But then we come to the elephant in the room. What about the endings? Are all those who felt betrayed be an ending 5 years old. I didn't have one problem with how they did the ending. They we trying to be artful and mysterious much like Kubrick in the movies. In fact movies have several examples of why you don't need to see every little detail. Do I like the new endings, yes. Well now for the outrange that was a relatively good (maybe great) horde mode multiplayer. I got 4500 force because I made go choices in the other 2 games. I still went through the multiplayer because it was fun, do you need to micro purchase. Well do you need to make them in any other multiplayer. It's not just EA every major multiplayer has come out with something like this so you can not and may not fault them. And now I come to the part where I get to be an mean. I don't know when you preordered your copies... but my collector editions were reserved for 9 months. I was one of the first if not the first to Pre-order the collector's edition from GameStop. It was $100 to get it day one and I was happy to pay every bit of it. It made my year along with Skyrim it was my top play game.",9,2013-09-18,PC,user

Type4101,"Still a letdown, years later. ME3 is a reminder that the world needs a real RPG revival. The age of dumbing down must end. Unfortunately, EA has announced that it has no intention of supporting future RPGs that don't involve micro-transactions, so there may be more dark days ahead. ME3 is, however, a decent cover-based shooter. It certainly has more characterization than most shooters, which is nice. That is small consolation for RPG fans, who have plenty of options in the over-saturated shooter market, if that is what they wanted to play (it isn't). Don't support ME3, even if it is on sale in the bargain bin.",2,2013-09-14,PC,user
Mr_NoFace,"friends and other people have been telling me to buy this, now I've finally got it and what a mistake that was, there are three options at the start of the game action I was tempted because most games these days only do action right? because they can't make a good story, role play no thanks I'm alright I'm not going to pretend that this is my life and finally story mode has a shooter these days finally got a good story! no the story of this is the world is getting attacked! if that hasn't been used a load, so yeah I choose story because for once in these new games I want a good story not just go here and kill everyone then go here and press this, while i was playing i would be cut off by cut scenes it was constant and it got annoying I got bored so fast I don't know if that's just if you choose story or if its like that with action to but soon as I forget about this game I might give it another go",3,2013-09-12,PC,user
EckSi,"The gameplay itself was great, but the direction that the writing leads decided to take the story at the end was terrible. Their faisco at writing a logical and well written ending on the first go around it why I am writing this review. They tore apart the lore by giving us an aweful space child. It completeley devalued and ruined the fear that I had of the reapers that I had had for years since the first Mass Effect. They suddently because the mere toys of this stupid little ghost boy who just happened to be at the final place and happend to solved everything for you with some color..... I could have written an ending with an awesome battle scene involving you and all your collecting war assest fighting alotside you, showing strength through diversity... you either had enough to overcome and prevail with a phyric victory or you didnt have enough and were crushed.

LairdEJM,"As we all know the anger is there over the ending, and when I first played through it I was as vocal in my displeasure as anyone else. But after adding the extended cut, (which if nothing else tries to help things) and playing it through with readjusted expectations as part of the trilogy, I have come to love 90% of it. Visually it is superb, the overall story keeps you engaged and the characters you know and love don't disappoint. My only gropes are: (The ending, but as I have already said I can live with it with a little help from my post story imagination) The lack of tactical choices; I wanted Shepard to control the Normandy in fleet battles and make big decisions on how to roll out the battle. And fire that awesome cannon!! :D The multiplayer element, which although is very good in its own right, should not impact at all on the single player.

Ruston,"To be **** my opinion...Mass Effect 3 isn't worse than 1 or 2. All games of Mass Effect's Trilogy are on the same level. I must say I didn't feel dissapointed playing this game, I was having fun since the first action to the last one. I can't understand why there are so many negative opinions. The main plot is nothing special but it's still good. Don't forget there are secondary missions which are just the cherry on the cake. ""Terrible writing"" I don't agree. For sure the best one is in Mass Effect 1 but we can't ignore this game because of it. Graphics Really Why we must care about it so hard... Anyway it doesn't look so bad and I am sure it's gonna be better in the next one. I am just worried about the fact ""Shepard Era"" is over. That's the only 1 thing which can hurts..

Their master plan involved deception and building the hype with excellent writing and clever storytelling, and they decide to end it by **** the fan base, and destroying years of hype, destroying one of the most original sci-fi franchises in order to make a profit.

Gothic90,"Due to length constraint, I'll just talk about a few non-ending problems I have with ME3. I still don't think EC writes a good ending, because Bioware tries to use the ending purely to make a point about human vs machines, rather than make an ending to a story. Problems are here. 1) Horrible controls. 5 conflicting functions bound to the same space bar. Especially frustrating in multiplayer. 2) A large number of boring fetch quests as side quests, with unhelpful quest entries that have no progress indications. 3) The so called return of RPG elements. Turns out to be looking for upgrades scattered everywhere. I am okay with both ME1's loot and ME2's lack of RPG elements, but this is garbage. 4) Stereotypes, stereotypes everywhere. Suddenly there are stereotypical stereotypical weak and annoying Asian, and a football jock and etc. To appeal to the masses? Seriously? 5) A lot of miscellaneous things that I would find quite repulsive. Like they purposely put them there just to disgust people. Other than that ME3 is fine. Parts of the story are still good. Some characters are still good, but not as much fun as the other two games in the series.",6,2013-08-24,PC,user

Littlefield,"The issue I have with all the low ratings... is they're by people who don't understand RPGs. RPGs are NOT about the end-game. They are irrefutably about the journey. So, when you're rating an RPG you need to view it differently compared to a cut and dry shooter, with that being said, the journey through Mass Effect 3 is unforgettable in my eyes. It brought closure to MANY issues in the mass effect universe. The story has some weak points, that's undeniable, but when the game is at a high-point it's almost unrivaled. Now that leads us to the ending... I will be completely honest, the 2 points that I deducted from this game, came solely from the ending. It is one of the WEAKEST endings to a video game series I have ever seen. The extended cut ending, fixes some issues, but not all, and still leaves more to be desired. The ending was unsatisfying, and left a bad taste in a lot of gamers mouths. With that being said, I feel as though they're options were somewhat limited as far as the ending goes, the trilogy built it up to a point where there was simply nowhere to go from where they were, and it caused the ending to come across as flimsy, unsatisfying, and somewhat disappointing. All in all, the game is NOT a bad game, and if you like the Mass Effect universe, get the game, play it, and enjoy it. The story is great throughout, game play is improved upon, much smoother, and contains some pretty difficult choices regarding your squad mates, and the galaxy as a whole. The game's major downfall is it's ending.",8,2013-08-14,PC,user

gustarivrag,"Time will only tell how great this game actually is. I don't understand the bias of some people here, you can't just low-grade spam reviews for a game just cause you don't like the ending. There is at least 4-5 factors when you judge something, so even if the ending is the worst possible, it can't seriously lower the grade for more than 1-2 points. And ME 3 is great in every possible aspect, let's get that clear for start. It is improved compared to ME 2 in a lot of ways, gameplay, graphics, you name it. There is lot more diversity between classes, when you play a class it actually feels like your playing that certain class, unlike ME1, where every class was just a different mix of same abilities. As for the ending issue, it has been updated and made downloadable for free. I can understand that you are not very sympathetic towards greediness of EA company, or that the ending made your efforts while progressing trough this really fun game kind of useless, but you wouldn't even get there if it wasn't well worth it.",9,2013-08-13,PC,user

I wonder what the user score would be if this game had a good ending. I'm glad Bioware released the Extended Cut; if they didn't my score would be a bit lower. This was a stellar sequel and all the ones and twos out of 10 are just immature. As a long time gamer I'm used to disappointing endings; its a common weakness in video game storytelling. Nevertheless an amazing title on Bioware's part, it still gave us a stellar story and characters. So they incorporated more action and gameplay elements? Get over it. Video games aren't supposed to be interactive movies.",9,2013-08-09,PC,user
NestLols,"Mass effect 3 is a fitting conclusion to the mass effect saga. It boasts significantly improved gameplay fluidity and mechanics, as well as a more varied campaign. The story is emotional, hard hitting, and diverse. The games visuals have been improved a lot, and the pc version looks quite spectacular despite and aging core engine, and runs smoother than the previous games to boot. In terms of streamlining which I hate the game is in between mass effect 1 and 2, the major disappointment in the game is the planet exploring, which has been stripped down. Imported save games determine a lot, from entire characters no longer existing in the story to conflicts that play out entirely different.Multiplayer is fun, and is not required to get the best ending in the game. In the end, mass effect 3 is special. As good as mass effect 2 in storytelling, and almost as good as mass effect 1 in rpg-like skill/item medications and exp distribution. My favorite in an acclaimed series.",10,2013-07-25,PC,user
KingShree,"Strange ending and the fact that its basically just Mass Effect 2 v2.0 prevents this game from being bombastic ending of the saga. Final battle is also very dull and the extra linearity of the game can be disturbing. Very good game, but not as good as ME2 or ME1.",8,2013-07-25,PC,user
Aetohatir,"First off I'd like to tell you from where I come I finished all the games mutiple times and I read the three first books. I know all about the indoctrination theory and any other fan fiction ending. I gave the other two games both a perfect rating although they had big flaws because I am very keen to the mass effect universe. I must agree to the general opinion ME3 is BY FAR the worst of all Mass effect games though it has its strengths and this game definatly is not a 4.8 Yes the Ending is bad and I dont understand why they even wanted to change it. If people want to spoil them selves they shouldnt have read the leak originated on neoGAF. Anyway It was nice to dive back in to the ME universe once more even though the story line of the game wasnt all that good even though you were able to port your old ME2 save into ME3 this didnt matter at all. Bioware just went with it that the player played all the ME2 DLC which is not always the case. the war rating had NO influence at all and yes the endings.. well you know the backslash The game had its good parts though too. The Soundtrack again was alsolutely superb following the more orchestral style of ME2. Visuals also were better than the other two games, and well the gameplay went a long way butis now actually playable as a cover based shooter. Or at least to big titles like Gears of War not an absolute catastrophy anymore. I absolutely recoment the first two mass effect games and if you enjoyed those you will at least want to play the third one. And this what it comes down to: This is not the grand finale we hoped for but it still is the finale and even though I cannot understand Bioware not just putting the Indoctrination theory slyly into the game via free DLC and makeing the recond straight once again we are stuck with what we have. The Multiplayer is fun to a certain extend, I played it about 20 hours but the micro transactions bug me still had a lot of fun with a friend in that mode. This is not a trrible game. And its not a bad game its just mediocre. the fault of the game failing so badly in compairsm with the first two you might push to EA, or to Bioware itself it still is worth while, but I wouldnt spend anythjing above 25€ on it. 6/10",6,2013-07-24,PC,user
GamersUprising,"It's by no means a bad game, the game play is amazing, the dialogue is great, the characters are relatable and it has that emotional tone that the first two games carried. What brought it down from a positive rating is the ending which managed to piss SO many gamers off. The ending of this game is a total slap in the face to fans of the Mass Effect games. It was like the developers completely forgot about the fact that all of the games are based around choice, but the ending betrays that fact. All three endings are incredibly similar, which made us feel as if our choices never mattered in the first place. I love the Mass Effect games but the ending of this game just brought it down. Never has a game ending developed so much controversy than the ending of Mass Effect 3, and that's a damn shame.",3,2013-07-23,PC,user
Vonnd,"I played this game a long time ago but just decided to come back and reflect. I thought the gameplay was good. But the best thing about this game was the atmosphere. It felt crushing at all times. I felt that there was no time and all would be lost, so I had to try something. I could really get into the mood of this game and I thought the ending reflected ME3's atmosphere as a whole perfectly. I think this game has had one of the best storylines in a game yet. The most important thing to me was the music combined with the few glimpses of light and hope spending time with those close to the protagonist. This game shows to me how creating a coherent structure for atmosphere can make for a unique, amazing and touching experience. I understand that this came at a cost of some features, but I still loved it. I also felt the game series had matured to beyond the black and white. I understand that the younger audience might find this annoying. I loved it. Finding an answer to all the questions after all that, would've been the definition of anticlimax.

I just can't bring myself to even install any of them, knowing how terribly bad it will end. Seriously there is no motivation to do anything anymore. Its as if you do something you believe to be worthwhile for years, and then you are told: ""Oh sorry, but you know, no one needs it, so scram!"" 3 best games ruined with a single ending.

SourHyperion1,"After hearing a lot about how Mass Effect 3 fell short of Mass Effect 2, I came in expecting something totally different than it delivered and in the best way. Mass Effect 3 picks up a bit after the events of Mass Effect 2 concluded. Shepard has somehow got himself free from Cerberus and grounded on Earth by the Alliance. Mass Effect 3 shows how dark the series can get allowing for the series to end very strongly. Gameplay: The game has updated its style, mainly when on a mission. The cover system has dramatically improved and both armor variation and the number of weapons has dramatically increased. The AI does get caught up quite a bit and this can lead to wasting a lot of medigel, but you can at least run over and help them up without the use of it. Most of the other mechanics of the game are the same, but missions now impact how ready your forces are to fight the reapers, which I thought was an excellent addition similar to that of Fable 3's, but much much better. There is also the improved scanning system where you just scan from the galaxy map, but in some systems this will alert the reapers. Graphics: Mass Effect 3 has gotten a bit of a face lift allows for more detail in almost everything and it looks brilliant. While the graphics are not the best, I don't think I've seen such a beautiful Sci-fi RPG to date. Story: The campaign takes Shepard to the far reaches of the galaxy, but sadly not all of it. I went on quite a few side missions and I never felt that I went as far as I could have. However, this is made up with some of the incredibly painful decisions you are forced to make. Most of those decisions are toward the end, but they will make you second guess yourself and even regret them. Then comes the infamous ending, which I thought was probably one of the most dramatic and depressing endings to a trilogy I have experienced. No spoilers, but if you were expecting a happily ever after, you will be disappointed and or surprised. I'm not quite sure why this game has received such bad reviews, I have played the entire trilogy through and I feel that each game brought something new and exciting to the table and Mass Effect 3 was no exception. You will not find an experience equal to that of this trilogy and if you are on the fence as to whether or not to buy it, go buy it and enjoy the many hours of brilliance it will give you.",9,2013-07-12,PC,user
Syrius00,"This game, well, is the conclusion of an incredible journey. All the Bioware team made a great work, overall. The game features great graphics and a captivating storytelling (even if the best one is in the second chapter IMHO). It is so fast paced that it can be exhausting at high difficulties. The finals, this time, are FINALS and even if they may leave you with disappointment (or tears, like my case) are original and EPIC. Multiplayer is OK, but I would definitely exchange it for more ""single player"". So, why nine? Actually, I would have liked to give a 8.5, but 9 is for the excellent references and the emotions I felt while playing. Anyway the game is a bit buggy now and then and some things seem to have been completed in a hurry. Anyway this won't ruin the experience at all. Want the best experience? Buy all the trilogy and ""grow up"" your Shepard. For me has been the best non-real experience of my life till now. Keelah se'lai!",9,2013-07-11,PC,user
WookieChestHair,"I can completely understand where people are coming from when they say they hated this game because of it's ending and whatnot, but what you can't ignore is the fact that until that point, the game was incredible. Seeing the characters from that past two games and even having a couple of them join your crew again brings great feelings of nostalgia and while I admit, the 'space bar to do everything' concept was quite poor, the reason I play Mass Effect was for the intricate storyline and the lovable characters, not the gameplay. The basic cover shooting mechanics and the games ending stopped this from getting a 10, but, in my opinion, it's still one of the greatest gaming series of all time, and I can't wait to see what Bioware gives us with the next instalment.",7,2013-07-05,PC,user
Floxer,"Mass Effect 3 (2012) Mass Effect 3 ist ein Science Fiction/Action Rollenspiel. Es ist die Fortsetzung und der Abschluss der Mass Effect Trilogie. Wie bereits sein Vorgänger, basiert das Spiel auf der Unreal-Engine 3 und wurde ebenfalls von BioWare (Baldur's Gate, Dragon Age) entwickelt. Der Publisher ist Electroic Arts. Das Spiel wird wieder aus der dritten Person gesteuert, sodass man einen guten Überblick über das Schlachtfeld hat und die Gestaltung der Spielfigur direkt erkennen kann. Die Spieldauer beträgt ca. 40 Stunden. Nachdem im ersten Teil ein abtrünniger Spectre (sowas wie Geheimpolizei mit unbeschränkten Befugnissen) namens Saren aufgehalten wurde, eine Reaper-Invasion zu initiieren (Reaper Maschinenvolk mit der Absicht alles Leben auszulöschen) und im zweiten Teil die Bedrohung der Kollektoren (von Reapern indoktrinierte Spezies) neutralisiert wurde, konnte es das Maschinenvolk nun doch schaffen in die Sonnensysteme der Völker der galaktischen Allianz einzudringen. Als Commander Shepard sieht man nun erneut der Gefahr ins Auge, einer gewaltigen Übermacht gegenüber zu stehen, die alles einsetzten, um das Leben in der Galaxie auszulöschen. Zusammen mit altbekannten Charakteren aus Mass Effect 1, sind die Völker der Allianz zu vereinen um den Reapern eine finale Endschlacht zu bieten. Dabei trifft man des Öfteren auch auf alte Bekannte aus dem zweiten Teil der Trilogie, die einem Aufträge anbieten und Unterstützung im Kampf gegen die Reaper zusichern. Durch die Möglichkeit Spielstände aus den vorher gespielten Teilen der Trilogie zu importieren, kann der Verlauf der Story sich ändern, da z.B. einige alte Crew-Mitglieder nicht überlebt haben oder Entscheidungen anders getroffen wurden als die Standardeinstellungen eines neuen Spielstandes es darstellen würden. Das Spielgeschehen kann maßgeblich beeinflusst werden durch eine Vielzahl verschiedener Entscheidungsmöglichkeiten, die den Spieler stellenweise mit z.B. ethnischen und moralischen Fragen konfrontiert. Durch ein ""Gesinnungssystem"" kann man so zu einem rücksichtslosen Tyrannen oder aber zu einem hilfsbereiten Helden werden. Zusätzlich bietet das Spiel die Möglichkeit sowohl als männlicher als auch weiblicher Charakter das Geschehen zu erleben. Dies verändert ebenfalls das Verhalten der Crew-Mitglieder. Der Wiederspielwert des Spiels ist also enorm. Durch weitere DLC's (Downloadable Content) erweitert sich die Story. Jedoch sind einige dieser Erweiterungen mit Kosten verbunden, bieten aber dementsprechend auch mehr Inhalt. Alles in allem übertrifft dieses Spiel trotz Neuerungen im Kampfsystem nicht die Vorgänger, zieht jedoch auf Augenhöhe. Für Mass Effect Veteranen ein Muss. Science Fiction Liebhaber und Rollenspiel Fans werden auch voll auf ihre Kosten kommen.",9,2013-07-05,PC,user

Tecco,"Best Game series out there, great story and better and better gameplay for each game that tops in Mass Effect 3 Abilities on different carracters that can be used in combination with each others, gameplay that makes you want to play just to play. A awesome story with characters you build a great personal relationship to, great laughs and great sorrows, that makes you go 35-45hours straight skipping work/school and forgetting to eat and sleep. Sadly people cant seem to review the game as a whole and focus on the ending that could be better, but even with the endings there is very little to put a finger on as a whole. Still it not even that bad a ending, just not how people want it to end making them butthurt, that they dont get a sugar sweet ending. I read trough afew critics in the ""red"" and alot of the stuff i just cant reconize from my playtroughs. Some state the exact opposite(Lies? but why?) of how the game works, some state the character acting and story is bad, even though i think both tops even the top end movies we have on the market today. This game made me play the ME1 and ME2 several times over to get the different coices and i have 5-7 playtroughs of the ME3 game itself, and besides that the surprisingly good Multiplayer i used a good 1000hours om itself.

Turk,"After the dust had settled and the brutal ""star child"" wars have been waged, I returned to ME3, and it still serves as the definitively example of how to disappoint on all levels. This game must have been designed to be a blockbuster with all those troublesome expenses related to quality cut out. The depth of the universe is gone, replaced by petty 3rd party dialogue microcosms that read like bad soap operas. The gameplay is as simplistic and vapid as the ending- even the hardest levels offer only random chance as a mechanic rather than strategy. Level design, if you can even call it that, is reduced to a corridor with walls to hide behind. If you are on a planet there is a nice background of a vibrant world that you will by no means be able to interact with ever- kind of a final ""f-you"" from EA. There is more, so much more, but I'm getting tired and my love of the first two games can only create so much antipathy towards this one.",4,2013-07-01,PC,user
Rennn,"Another masterpiece from Bioware. First, I've never played the game without the free Extended Cut DLC, which alters the endings. Keep that it in mind. From what I'm told, the original endings were horrible, but they're not bad with the EC DLC. Many of the complaints are just NOT true. Characters do not randomly die. I imported a save which I'd used in both ME1 and ME2, and all of my choices mattered. Mordin lived, Tali lived, Garrus lived. Liara lived, and I was ecstatic to notice that she's back as a permanent companion in ME3, because she was my romance interest in ME1 and ME2. Everyone relevant lived. I even got the Geth and Quarians working together... I guess I don't understand the negative reviews for ME3. If you make too many mistakes you'll get everyone killed and be a sad kitty, but if you put some time into the series (all 3 games) your choices really accumulate and you can save virtually everyone. The reapers are a galaxy-destroying terror. Yes, it's hard to get the good ending and requires a lot of effort on the players part. You will need to play all three games and get everyone working together. You'll need to mediate disputes between your companions, and you'll need to earn massive amounts of loyalty if you want to survive the reaper onslaught. It wouldn't make sense any other way. Maybe modern gamers don't typically understand this, but an epic victory means way more if it's difficult to achieve. The reapers are powerful... It takes a very skilled and diplomatic player to defeat them without your friends dying in the process. it's sad to see an amazing game like Mass Effect 3 get bashed simply because players weren't willing to put in the effort to save their favorite companions.",10,2013-06-27,PC,user

Lynnux,"Obviously the parallel development of Star Wars: The Old Republic took a toll on both games. ME 3 seems to be hastily assembled to finish the series in the given time frame. The ending strongly reminds me of another game series of the Cyberpunk genre which I also like. But this ending style is imho not fitting to the ME series. The last two missions felt right out of place. But face it: these are the most the negative points of the third part. ME3 is still clearly above average and is never worse than a 7.0. No way Sorry, just because you've expected a happy end doesn't make the whole game bad. The ""Galaxy at War"" mechanics is simply brilliant. It allows all your deeds of the three parts and two additional games, the cooperative multiplayer (included in ME3) and the mobile app ""Infiltrator"" to be integrated and add to your effort to save the galaxy. And don't believe everything you read here. E.g. multiplayer is not necessary at all to get the best endings but you need a pretty good score which is maybe not possible if you killed everything and everyone possible in the first two parts ;-p You'll just feel the consequences of your previous actions. And this is clearly a benefit of this game series which also contributes to ME3. My advice to all players who gave a score below 5: play the ME series a second time and you'll see the game a little bit differently.",7,2013-06-25,PC,user
braeden,"Again, the user score is more than unfair. Mass Effect 3 is a good game, but it just doesn't live up to the expectations people had after the second part. The main problem with Mass Effect 3 is the storytelling which builds up to whole lot of nothing. And with this, I don't mean just the ending which is unsatisfying to say the least. The whole coming back to Earth part seams rushed after spending the whole game preparing for it. Also one of the main elements of the game, collecting war resources, seems to affect nothing in the end (maybe some cinematic is slightly altered). Overall gaming experience is also not quite as immersive as with Mass Effect 2. On several occasions, I couldn't help the feeling that I was just running around completing some random tasks to get to the next place. Also NPC characters didn't feel quite as deep as in Mass Effect 2. However, compared to storytelling these are very minor issues and the overall gaming experience was still very good. It's hard to say if this game can be recommended or not. Basically everything, except the storytelling, is done as it should or better. However, one of the worst things game can do is leave players unsatisfied at the end. Thus I wouldn't at least wait some kind of bargain before considering buying this.",8,2013-06-25,PC,user
Smartchoy,"Such a disappointing end to a series. The problem with the ending is simply that it such a waste of opportunity. If Bioware wanted whatever ending is their decision but they don't really go through it, no funeral, no wedding, no epilogue, just laziness, just nonsense. FFXII opens with a great wedding and a funeral in its opening animation, I don't care if its happy or sad, I just wish to enjoy the feelings, I am paying for this. Mass effect 3 had the perfect opportunity to make you feel so much, you have been playing so long with this crew, a reunion, or funeral, or big closure would have made me feel so much, but is just a big ""thank you for playing, but we wont say what happened, bye""",1,2013-06-24,PC,user

EliteAmatuer,"Mass Effect 3 is a good, good, good game. Yes, the part of the ending with the child makes no sense (not to spoil-y I hope). But other than that, Mass Effect 3 is a great accomplishment in gaming. With ME 3, Bioware found a good balance between action and RPG elements. For RPG fans, there is a long list of skill trees to mess around with and weapon modification to match your gameplay style. They removed the class limitation on weapons and simply let you choose which of the pistols and rifles you want to use. All of the powers have been balanced so that all classes are equally viable on the hardest difficulties. All in all gameplay has been greatly improved from ME 2. The story is still great. You have less squad members than ME2 but they are more fleshed out. If you haven't played the first two games a lot of the story might be lost on you but for people have played both ME1 and ME2 in order, ME 3 finishes up the Story arcs of each character(s) in a beautiful and cathartic way. You have a lot of influence and involvement with how the stories end which increase the player's investment in the game. I plead with you, dear reader, ignore the bad user reviews and give this game a chance.",9,2013-06-20,PC,user
Toffenuff,"I cannot, in good conscience, give this game any lower than a 6 because up until the ending the game was superb and truly enjoyable for me. It's epic to gather the fleets of the universe together and to warp into battle like they do in the ending portion of the game. It builds upon the (in my opinion) great and enjoyable gameplay of ME2, and as usual the graphics are beautiful. Splendid voice acting bring each character to life and the relationships and character development are all there. One of the best things about the ME series and Bioware is their whole, ""what you did in the previous game impacts this game"" and while there's still a cop out in some aspects that some of the things you did only are acknowledged or shown in a minor way, I think that's still impressive enough that it makes you feel you have truly impacted this universe beyond simply completing the missions. You've made choices, and those choices have had consequences. One thing I wish they had added was the ability to control real control of the Normandy and have some space maneuvering (as in simulation, not the Galaxy Map) and more importantly, space battles! Amazing game, but horrendous ending that was only partial fixed by the DLC. Would've given this game a 9 were it not for the ending. After dozens of hours of gameplay through various replays of each game to test different combinations of choices... how could you end the game like that? It was just... devastatingly disappointing.",6,2013-06-19,PC,user
Fallrim,"We really do need to stop rating this game on its ending. Let's be fair to Bioware, they had a damn difficult task giving us a fitting, satisfying conclusion to a goddamn fantastic franchise, and for the most part, they achieved it. Let's get the positive stuff done first. The game has much improved combat, and the voice acting, dialogue and story (for the most part) are as hard hitting as before, with several emotional scenes being some of the best character endings I have witnessed. The games inclusion of multiplayer should really have been story co-op, but the horde, co-op mode serves as a nice distraction for when you tire of the core game. The music is good as ever, and the graphics have improved. The game does a good job of getting the atmosphere of all out war right, and it feels like the universe is fighting the reapers. Now for the bad stuff. Before we address the ending, there were other things wrong with this game. Some idiot at Bioware for some reason decided to remove mission tracking in journal entries, so we never know how far we are in a certain mission! There does feel like a bit of Michael Bay EXPLOSIONS EVERYWHERE action going off here, but despite this it would have been nicer to see all out battles going on rather than linear small skirmishes. Now, the ending. Yes, it was bad. It was an A, B, or C option like we were explicitly promised would not happen. And yes, it had many plot holes and felt irritating and out of character for Shepherd to go along with it. But honestly, just because 20 minutes of the game was bad, it does not mean the whole game was bad.",8,2013-06-15,PC,user
dam1730,"First of all, the user score for this game is in no way indicative of the quality of this game. Mass Effect games are very different in the world of gaming as they are a hybrid of several different genres. Obviously Mass Effect games are RPGs, but they also incorporate FPS, adventure, and even strategy elements all into one game. The best part of the Mass Effect series is that you get to know the characters well. Whether you like the character or not, you know them very well by the end of the series and become connected to some of them. Another great thing about the series is that every player has their own Shepard that they can come to identify with as well. Their are many things that I like in ME3 when compared to the other games in the series. First of all, the graphics look much better, especially in gameplay itself. The storyline is pretty good. If you've played the first two games of the series, you could probably predict some of what was going to happen, but after putting at least 50-60 hours into the first 2 games, this is probably to be expected since you knew this was the final entry of the trilogy. As far as combat goes, as with the other games, it can be as difficult or as easy as you want it to be. I've found different classes to be much easier to play because certain enemies are overly strong at the higher difficulty levels and certain classes make it much easier to defeat those particular enemies. The decisions of this game are heavily influenced by past actions, much more so than ME2 as ME1 and ME2 actions both have a large effect on decisions in this game. A lot of controversy surrounded the ending of this game, and it did certainly deserve some controversy, as when I first finished the game I sat and stared at the screen for 5 minutes in disbelief. I do encourage every player to look into the ending more, there's a lot of stuff out there which is interesting. For example, I find ""indoctrination theory"" to be a good explanation. The amount of emotion that this ending caused shows the amount of passion that this series creates. I really believe this series is a must play for anyone who likes games because I think it has a little something for everyone. This game is not perfect, if the ending were better if would be close. I give this game an 8.5, but it will show up as a 9. Lot's of angry people reviewed the game two seconds after they finished it and were upset. There are also people who fell in love with the original game and don't like how 2 and 3 play. ME1 is very different, and ME2 and ME3 are similar but with slight differences.",9,2013-06-14,PC,user
Bestpony,"There's a whole litany of problems with ME3 and, well, just look at the user score here. That disastrous ending will be remembered 10 years from now (and the Extended Cut DLC doesn't really help), the writing is very uneven, the facial animations are almost nonexistent, the journal is next to useless, and then there's that dreadful business with day 1 DLC adding a character that is essential to the story and yet ends up being rather boring. And you know what? None of that matters all that much because ME3 still completely delivers on its promise of bringing an end to an epic story and doing so via a tight and very fun to play rpg/shooter game. You meet a ton of old friends (in fact, you meet pretty much everyone from the previous two games), you make some new ones (Vega, Cortez, and Traynor are all great and quite down-to-earth compared to the crazy suicide squad in ME2), there are memorable battles, tough choices, historic events, tragic sacrifices... pretty much everything I wanted from a Mass Effect game. It's a rushed product, made by a team that was obviously tired and wanted to be done with it as quickly as possible, which is unfortunate, but at the end of the day, it's a powerful conclusion to a great trilogy.",8,2013-06-07,PC,user

AtomicZap,"I must say, this game starts very poorly (even worse than ME2) and it probably has the worst ending of any of the hundreds of games that I have played. It also doesn't provide much direction at the beginning, so if you play without using a wiki (like I did) you can miss out on a lot of content that I would have liked to play. That said, I have no other complaints about this game. While you don't get as many squad members, you can still develop meaningful relationships with them throughout the game. The world is fantastic. I'm probably going to be crucified for this, but I think the Mass Effect story/universe is superior to both Star Wars and Star Trek.

obscurus166,"Mass Effect 3 is a basically decent game which is irretrievably spoiled by oversimplification and lack of dramatic direction. The game looks marvellous, but, as with many Bioware games, the locations are Potemkin villages: Shepard and her squadmates are restricted in their movements, hemmed in on all sides in small arenas with convenient chest-high walls, with no potential for interaction with the scenery. Combat largely handles well, but never strays from the mould of ""cover-based shooter."" The lack of any real challenge from the enemies discourages tactical thinking and the awkward use of the ""F"" key as a melee button makes the use of melee an unrealistic option on the PC. What is particularly frustrating about this game is how the stripped-down interface divests the gamer's experience of any verve or life. So many of the side missions are no more sophisticated than a text-based DOS game. When exploring a planet to find resources for the war, a player is simply told that he had recovered something of use, but there is no game-driven, interactive imperative to treat those text notifications with anything other than apathy. The ""Citadel"" DLC adds some welcome opportunity for character interaction and development, but really ought to have been part of the original game I can only imagine how shallow and unsatisfying ME3 would have been without it. The ending of Mass Effect 3 has attracted opprobrium quite rightly. Labouring hard over the course of three games to save squadmates, or entire species, has little or no dramatic payoff. The destinies of squad-mates and their unusual pairings are left ignored and untold. The narrative justification of the final denouement is weak and unsatisfactory, and somewhat contradicts established canon. This is particularly disappointing when the stripped-down, simplified gameplay mechanic runs the player on rails towards the choice of four such unsatisfying conclusions. For all those gripes, there is some fun to be had here, but ME3 deserves to be remembered most for squandered opportunities.",6,2013-05-11,PC,user

dumle,Mass effect 3 disappoints in several important aspects. The writing in the game is extremely uneven which really drags a game like this down. Sure there are some cool moments here and there but the story is overall really weak and the game is full of awkward and cheaply written moments. And it doesnt help that the conversation wheel is dumbed down too the absurd. The dialogue options are extremely binary and quite often they lead to the same result. The only difference is whether you get some paragon or renegade points in the end. And when you do get to make an important choice then the dialogue wheels poorly explained choices in simply not enough. The renegade/paragon options in the cutscenes also feels really cheap since you have no idea what kind of choice you are making. Overall the game lacks the kind of interaction you would expect from a roleplaying game and the games mission-design feel extremely linear and more like an action game than a roleplaying game. Another thing worth mentioning is that this game is much more combat oriented than previous games in the series. There are very few hub-based areas in the game and you will spend the majority of your time in combat missions. Now the combat is quite good for a roleplaying game. For an action game however the combat is extremely average. The combat is a pretty basic cover-mechanic based shooter with the normal peak-shoot-duck and wait for the shield to recharge type of gameplay. It is by no means a catastrophe but it simply cant carry an entire long game like this. And chances are that you will get bored of the combat before beating this game which is a shame since that is what you are going to spend your time doing. The focus on combat sadly also mean that a lot of the environments you are in are nothing more than boring grey/brown ruins which is kind of sad since there is a lot of cool places to the explore in the universe. You do thankfully also get to visit some pretty neat places in the game which is nice. The exploration in the game do however leave a lot of things to be desired. The maps are often extremely linear and the lack of side quest and stuff to find leads to you not feeling the need to explore. I should also note that both the item and enemy variety is quite limited which i really thought hurt the game. I believe that the limited enemy variety is particularly sad since games like this can make up all kinds of cool faunas and cultures to fight. You are sadly forced to fight the same quite boring enemies over and over again which doesn't really help the combat. The visuals are for the most part alright but there are some low-res textures in the game here and there that just look awful by contrast. I also have issues with the weird camera angel they have chosen for the game. Something you cant fix in the extremely basic options menu. Now despite being quite critical of the game i must mention that the game is by no means so bad that some people make it out to be. I would say that its extremely average. The game have a long list of flaws but it also have a decent amount of alright content in it. I picked it up for a cheap price and i dont regret doing that despite the games flaws. if you however go into this game expecting a traditional bioware rpg or a worthy continuation of the mass effect saga then chances are that you will be disappointed. I should also mention that the were some quite shady dlc practices involved with this game. But you should try to make up your own mind regarding that.,5,2013-04-30,PC,user

silverwolf12711,"I know many people are very angry at this game, and I understand that. Mass Effect 3 is just as much a step backward as a step forward from the previous iterations of the series. ME3 is much more action-oriented than the previous two games, something which I don't mind, There are more weapons in each category, and each class can now use every weapon. For me this opened up new gameplay possibilities. I could be a sentinel with a sniper rifle, a shotgun-wielding adept or engineer. While I like some of the new combat changes, the loss of RPG elements annoys me. Shepard can still pick his/her squad, but now there are only 6 squad members to chose from, 7 if you bought the DAY-ONE dlc, as opposed to the 11-12 there were in ME2. Loyalty mission are also gone, which takes away a personal element. Long-time fans of the series may be a bit disappointed by all this, but ME3 makes up for it in other ways. The Graphics are actually impressive, with nice lighting effects and great CGI space battles. These battles will be in great abundance, as now Shepard is facing the full force of the reaper onslaught against the galaxy. Shepard will have to unite the races of the galaxy, no easy task, to successfully fight off the reaper invasion and recapture earth. Choosing which races to side with, and some actions that Shepard chooses have an effect on and overall ""readiness"" bar which indicates military strength, and chances of victory in the final battle. Unfortunately, none of the other decisions Shepard has made throughout the other games will have ANY impact on the final ending. The end of the game feels rushed and lazy. For this i find that EA is probably to blame, rushing the game out ahead of schedule. An ending DLC does fix many of these issues, but leaves many unanswered. The fact that there even is an ending DLC to me shows that bioware cares for the universe it created, even if the messed up the first time around. Another good thing is that the awful mining mini games are **** be replaced with a less annoying, simpler, ""find stuff on planet to help you in the war effort"". One final thing that annoyed me about the gameplay was that instead of multiple factions and enemies, there are only three: Cerberus, reapers, and geth. This feels like another move away from more rpg elements to action elements. The AI is adequate; on higher difficulties some of the bigger enemies can be troublesome. Despite the changes, ME3 still feels like Mass Effect, a third person cover **** hybrid. Using Shepard's powers and squad mate's powers to effectively combat enemy strengths and weaknesses is something true fans of the series will find fun and familiar. The soundtrack is great, the characters still great, and the story only slightly less than what most expect from Mass Effect. Which brings me to the multiplayer. Many people were worried it would take over from the single player, but it doesn't, in fact, it provides a welcome distraction from the reaper attack. Multiplayer is a horde-based mode in which up to four players can fight against waves of enemies of different types as many different races and classes. Ever wanted to play as a quarian engineer? A drell assassin, turian soldier, or even Krogan and Geth? There are also scores of weapons, upgrades, and attachments available. So far all the MP DLCs have been free, but MP still feels like EA trying to make quick cash sometimes. Multiplayer can still be fun, though. All considered, Mass Effect 3 feels a slightly rushed ending to a series dear to many people's hearts. It is still a good, dun game, but lets down in many things fans have come to expect form Bioware and the series as a whole.",8,2013-04-28,PC,user
48Laws,"****/watch?v=gu731UtTFqo I wish I could have seen this before purchasing ME3. Personally, I was a loyal follower of the ME franchise since a year or so after the first game came out. I watched as a high-quality RPG turned into a fun storytelling-driven shooter hybrid. I enjoyed both of the first two games, but worried that Bioware may have been taking too many creative liberties with game play design. After DA2 became a malignant tumor on the whole DA franchise, I worried that marketing was steering video games toward a more obviously profit-driven path. I enjoyed seeing some of my favorite characters in ME3, but having the entire series to compare the game to I felt disappointed and wished I hadn't purchased it before it's price plummeted. The game screams linearity, entire plot lines promised to have wildly different conclusions were railroaded and some of the characters with strong convictions pulled a 180 in the (choo-choo) 6-month mandated shore leave Shep was put on after Arrival (whether or not it was even played). James Vega was chosen by Bioware, knowing fewer squad mates would be included in this game, to accommodate newer players and have someone dumber than them on the Normandy. 17% of your squad is new, has no clue what's going on, and was included solely for first-time players; It really sends a message to those who have played the game for 5+ years (notice Vega wasn't made DLC; he must have either been considered more 'essential' than a Prothean by the devs or EA thought nobody would buy it). A broken journal system ensures players will constantly be wondering whether they scanned the right section of space for an item or have yet to drop it off to the NPC on the citadel who's conversation Shep overheard (these are laughably called 'side missions'). After you're confused by wtf just happened after the endings, you can buy all the answers in DLC form for $10 in Leviathan. This game is complete rubbish without the answers in that DLC pack (and even so, the plot further devolves into a joke). What's worst of all for me: this game makes me feel embarrassed for all the recommendations I gave out for the series after ME1 and ME2. I know I've personally brought 6 friends into the Mass Effect world, and only one of them enjoyed the ""experience"" of ME3. The rest still joke about the endings over a year past the game's release, and according to much of the polling done the majority of the fan base feels the same way. After this debacle, I won't be making that mistake with Bioware products again.",4,2013-04-27,PC,user

The overall gameplay is good, it is getting better since ME1 and ME2. Many of the scenes are touching and sad. It is a shame I did not play it on release. Thanks Bioware, for this epic journey.",9,2013-04-05,PC,user
nkaduthod,"As a beloved fan of the Mass Effect series, I was without a doubt quite disappointed with this game. While the game play is good and offers a more fluid experience, I fell that they dumbed the combat down to much. They also took away most of the RPG aspect of the game I loved. The story I felt was really lacking compared to ME1 & ME2. The new characters like Diane and James were very uninteresting and the graphics and animations have barely been touched since ME2. My decisions imported from the first two games didn't really impact the story and I feel like BioWare and EA were turning this game into a clone of Gears of War except in space. And what the is up with Day 1 DLC From Ashes? For a very important character relevant to the entire series and basically what it is based on? EA is obviously trying to pressure BioWare into making a more ""mass-appealing game"". No! Also, the quest system is complete and utter And what happened to my narrative structure. I sometime barely see the wheel in conversations anymore! Also, the score of this game was lackluster. Some good about the game. I thought most of the main missions were fine ad well-crafted although they ended anti-climatically and the weaponry was good. The main teammates and old puns and people from the old games appear and make the game more enjoyable. Combat is great. Checkpoints are forgiving. Powers are good. Multiplayer is fun. And then, theirs the end. The ending of the game was so outrageous, disgusting, unethical, the biggest hypocritical scene made by BioWare that it made me mad. Even with Extended Cut DLC, it was terrible. I could have picked a better ending from my mother****ing ass. All in all, Mass Effect 3 was hyped up to be an excellent, but failed to deliver on so many levels. However, I still enjoyed the game for what it was. But seriously, DLC in this game is pretty OK, but they make it so short for 15.00 im spending for it",6,2013-04-05,PC,user

This development of the franchise really has me fearing for the future of the ME series.",2,2013-03-30,PC,user
Minigun,"Here's a different kind of review: I actually liked the ending! Ok, so I started my Mass Effect journey with a bargain purchase of the first game in 2010, followed by a bargain purchase of the second part of series in late 2011 and now the final part in 2013. I still clearly remember the whole story and the feelings I had while playing it, so I can speak both for ME3 and the trilogy as a whole. Technically speaking, ME3 had superb audio and nice graphics. Very satisfying and enjoyable audiovisually. Game never crashed, I did not encounter any bugs either. Game felt very solid all around. The Origin requirement is a downer, but a small one. The atmosphere of the game (ie. the despair of the war) was a bit forced at times, but in the end held quite nicely. In ME1 I liked the feeling of vastness, how the plot spanned a lot of places on a huge scale. ME2 had perhaps did not have as epic a feel to it, for most of the game you spent hiring squad members from not-so-epic places and fights. I think ME3 went back to the roots in the epicness of scale. In ME1 I liked the fighting system and finding and upgrading new weapons. ME2 kind of streamlined the combat, but also removed all those micro-management details such as weapon mods. ME3 took somewhat a middle road in that regard: weapon mods return, but the weapon arsenal is quite limited. The biggest problem in fighting I had was Shepard getting stuck in cover when trying to run, resulting in a couple of unnecessary deaths in some of the harder fights. Other than that, gameplay felt pretty smooth. On terms of dialogue I think ME2 was the high point of the series. I really liked especially the female Shepards delivery of her lines. ME3 is not that good, but certainly not bad, either. The galaxy map mini-game this time was avoiding reapers, who were alerted by scanning the space for artifacts etc. I think ME1 had the best mini-game in that you actually landed on the planet and searched for stuff, even though it did get quite repetitive after while. In ME2 the mineral scanning was just dumb, as it did really not offer any challenge and there really was no big difference in the tactic you did it. The reaper mini-game in ME3 is again quite unnecessary, but at least you can apply some tactics to it, and it isn't really that much of an annoyance. And then there is the ending. I did play the extended cut, but also watched all the original ending videos from YouTube. I didn't really see the necessity of the extended endings, although they were perhaps a bit more satisfying. And the fourth ending type was indeed a smart move, which should have been in the original release also. On a side note, I also have played Eye of the Beholder, which threw you right back into DOS prompt after finishing the game, so I'm used to not having any fancy ending scenes. Anyway, most comments I've read about the ending being bad had two things in them: previous choices in the games had little to no effect, and not everything was explained. I think both are wrong accusitions. Choices in the previous games mainly affected your companions: who you were working with. At no point do I recall making any huge decisions directly regardin the forthcoming reaper invasion. Killed or saved the rachni queen in Noveria? Who cares, no one probably even knew she was there in the first place. Killed Wrex or was his best friends? Doesn't matter, there are plenty of krogans to be their leader, and plento of people on Normandy to be your wingmen. My point is, all the choices you made only affected the people around Shepard not things on a galactic scale. Therefore, I don't see how can someone expect so see any huge change in the outcome no matter what they did in the previous games. On the other hand, I still think they did a hell of a job with all the different combinations of who are alive and who you are with: dialogue changes according to the setting, and there are a huge number of different settings, which your previous choices _do_ affect. And the other thing, about leaving stuff open. I think the ending tied all the knots there were to be tied regarding galactic scale. Again, what happens to your mates is a different story, and left open. But that was not the point of the big picture. The point was the reaper invasion, and that was concluded in satisfying enough a way. The multiplayer requirement for the ""better"" endings was a stupid move, but I hear it was removed in the extended cut patch. I wouldn't know, as I ended up hacking my save game just to be sure I get the best ending: there were no multiplayer games anymore to boost your rating. All in all, a highly recommended game, and nowadays very good entertainment value for the cost: I only paid 9,95 in Origin store. I would give the game 8.5/10, which rounds to 8 just because of the multiplayer thing possibly affecting your single player campaign ending.",8,2013-03-29,PC,user
terbas,"I don't know what the people who poorly rated this game were thinking but this is one legendary game. It immersed me in the first couple of hours and I can't leave ME3 for long hours once I start to play it.

AlexFili,"Mass Effect 3 takes all of the plot pieces in the previous two games and delivers on a massive scale. The first thing you see is Shepard being put on trial for the events between the previous games. Just as the council get going on their debate, the Reapers launch an assault on the Earth, destroying a large portion of it. Shepard literally has to fight his way off the Earth, getting through some Reaper forces and just trying not to get hit by gigantic lasers and all the explosions which are occuring everywhere. Once you leave Earth, you have to try to get the support of the alien races to prepare against the Reapers. Unfortunately, the Reapers have already started attacking Palaven, the Turian homeworld and Tuchanka, the Krogan homeworld. You have to get the Krogans on your side for the Turians to help. Later on you’ll be attempting to gain the support of the Salarians, Asari and Quarians. There really is a feeling of tension and excitement that the other games didn’t have. For once, the enemy is a large opposing force and the whole galaxy is feeling it’s effects. The war is happening on three fronts. There are the main attack force of the Reapers, which utilise other alien races in their army, such as the Turian-style Marauders and the Asari-style Banshees. Then there are the Cerberus troopers, which are being led by the Illusive Man and are attacking colonies for an unknown reason. On a lesser front you also have the heretic Geth, which are attempting to keep the Perseus Veil under control. In most single-player missions you’ll be darting in and out of cover, attempting to pick off enemy forces. The overall intelligence of the enemies in this game has improved dramatically. Different units protect themselves in different ways. For instance, the Nemesis uses a sniper rifle to deal large amounts of damage, while the Phantom attempts to defeat targets instantly with it’s sword. When put together this is a deadly combination. There are also enemies that utilise smoke grenades, shields, turrets and more. Fighting is hectic and tense, using squadmates powers is recommended. You have a total of six squadmates in the main storymode and an additional squadmate exclusive in the extra Downloadable Content mission. While there are overall less squadmates than Mass Effect 2, the relationships between them and the character are more pronounced. Between missions characters will move around the ship, get into discussions and think about certain things. In the Citadel, each squad member goes to a different place, where they can talk with the player. Commander Shepard is the player character (which can be Male or Female), who is tasked with making lots of choices. Some of the choices are very difficult and will require the player to think forward. The choices made in Mass Effect 1 and 2 will dramatically affect the story. Such as how you dealt with the Rachni Queen or if you saved Maelon’s data on the genophage cure. You have a total of six classes, each with different unique skills and strategies which apply to it. For each additional form of support gained in single-player, you will gain another War Asset, with a numerical value. These values effect the strength of the forces attacking the Reapers, determining the overall success of the final attack. Mass Effect 3 is a fantastic game and a definitive Sci-Fi experience. Fans of the series will not be disappointed.",10,2013-03-28,PC,user
TheCuteKitten,"The only good thing about this game is the amount of weapons and customization for your skills. The voice acting is brilliant apart from Jessica Chobot. That's it. The story is full of plotholes, contradiction, retcons and downright nonsensical at times. The enemies and AI behaviour is subpar. Everything just bumrushes you and and do not use strategy of any sort. There is too little gameplay and too much cutscenes which makes the game feels like an interactive movie. There is also almost no RP element in the game apart from power customization. Your choices do not matter. The ending introduces new concepts altogether. Unnecessary inclusion of children to create emotions. So yeah, a botched job from Biower.",4,2013-03-27,PC,user

Gargus,"I'm not here to rip on ME3 just for the sake of doing so or because its what's cool to do on the internet like so many others. Basically ME3 is the worst of the series in every way possible compared to the other 2 games because it doesn't build or improve anything. It simply just tries to hurriedly finish the series for the sake of a cash in on the title. 1- There is no sense of exploration. The game as efficiently as possible holds your hand every step the way and has you actually being on the ground doing things the least amount possible. Side missions are carried out by quickly scanning a planet ala ME2 and then firing a probe. That's it. You don't explore, you don't get to check out uncharted worlds simply for the sake of curiosity or anything. Scan, shoot probe, side mission done all without even leaving the galaxy map. This tactic accounts for the majority of side missions. ME1 you could explore the galaxy drive around in that horribly handling buggy and had a sense of discovering things, ME2 you could land on planets and explore doing side missions with some not even firing a single shot like the crashed cruiser balanced on the mountain peak but all of those things are gone in 3. The game just holds your hand and ushers you from mission to mission. 2- You don't get to actually chose anything, everything is pre determined for you. Even if you chose the renegade or paragon path you get the exact same result and no one treats you differently and you get no alternative paths depending on your karma scale which makes it all incredibly pointless and just window dressing for the fact the story is entirely linear and so is your character. 3- The characters are all the same ones, only less compelling. There are a couple new characters but they are highly disposable and not even worth messing with. James for instance is basically just a guy who talks 90% of the time like a generic white guy, 10% of the time he throws out some Mexican phrases like saying ""loco"" a lot in his generic white guy trying to impersonate a Mexican guy and he looks like he was taken from the show jersey shore. When a old character returns you can see it coming a mile away. For instance you go into a area where the mission briefing talks about geth then you can see 45 minutes before which old character is going to come back. All the characters themselves seem hollow and rushed, they lack the personality that made them endearing in the other games and most are there only long enough to be overly obvious in a very specific mission or they simply show up for 3 minutes of camera time practically winking at the player with a nod and then are gone. 4- The story compared to the others ****. The other games had side stories, character stories, side missions with their own short stories and so on. ME3 on the other is basically this ""Everything is going to be destroyed"". That's pretty much it because no matter where you go or what you do its always about the war specifically and nothing else. I also got sick of hearing phrases like ""were here to save lives"", ""were doing this to save lives"", ""this weapon will save lives"", ""we need to stick together to save lives"", ""billions of lives are on the line and were here to save them"", etc and after about 8 hours I was sick of hearing about the war and saving lives. 5- The game play was basically just one big shooting gallery and hiding behind chest high walls. Every single fight is basically you hiding behind chest high walls to peak out and fire a few rounds only to hide back behind said wall. It was incredibly boring and has been done to death in dozens of other games. The combat was mindless and mediocre. It felt like they put absolutely no effort into the combat at all and rushed you through it in order to get to the next scene of hearing Sheppard say ""saving lives"". 6- The ending was atrocious. This is a series that prides itself on story, characters and dialogue. We all spent over 100 bucks playing all 3 games and spent over 100 hours playing all 3 games but bioware seemed to say ""This is the end of the trilogy so who cares about the ending"". The ending is the most important part of any story of any kind because its the very last thing you leave the person with and its supposed to be a reward, the climax to everything leading up till then, basically the ending is the most important part of any story. But the ending of ME3 was over in just a minute or so despite the dozens of hours of dialogue, cut scenes and story in the rest of the series they got lazy at the end. It gives no satisfaction at all. I can honestly say it is the laziest segment of the series. I did like though they had the balls to do what they did with Sheppard, but the ending still **** and doesn't make you glad to have finished the series.",1,2013-03-07,PC,user
ThE_MarD,"Heyyo, I can't believe the ""checking downloadable content"" bug is still in this game!

I looked on forums and everything and there's no fix other than ""disconnect from the internet"" which is annoying as heck JUST to play this game so that's why it gets such a low review score. Fix your crap BioWare.. I'm an Albertan and I can't believe you guy's haven't fixed this bug still. If there's a problem? Bigger Hammer, Bigger Wrench. Get'r dun. The gameplay is once again an improvement over the last game. It seems every Mass Effect they fine tun the combat even more which is great. I still miss the unique weapon overheating method they used in ME1 and using skills to overheat weapons was a plus.. The way they did inventory is again another welcomed change cause now you can't just bulk up on everything and have no consequences. So far?

But i've completed the game 3 more times(with the slightly improved new ending they made for free DL) and I now realize that the ending is a small 1% **** that is otherwise a very enjoyable work of art. 9/10.

Alsvha,"It could have been so good, but it fell short. Mass Effect 3 is a decent game, scared by some bad design decisions and an awful, inconsistent ending. The combat in the game is more fluent than the predecessors, the graphics is generally crisp despite Shepard still feel sluggish when running around and navigating the (static) world. The writing is decent in this game, however it does occasionally feel very 'soap'-television. Some of the characters are also very under represented in this game (especially characters like Jack, Miranda and so on). Even Ashley feels tacked on. Bioware's attempt at trying to set a dark atmosphere of doom and despair falls short in the game and it feels like many of the games 'sad' moments are so obvious that it's like trying to force an emotion more than build an emotion. Save perhaps for 'Mordin Solus' which is as brilliant a character in this as 'he' was in ME2. Weapon modifications are back (yah). Although you quickly learn to just pick the best weapon and use. The most redeeming part of ME3 is the music. Brilliant music. I can even listen to that while not playing the game that's how good some of the pieces are. However the quest system in this game is bad, very bad. Basically you have some main quests which drive the story forth. These are mostly gotten via the main characters. Then there's some side quests which is gotten via the mail terminal. Not much different than ME2. However then there's quests gotten from listening in on random people which pops up and requires you to 'scan' planets, and then pick up the item via the scan. However the journal system and lack of inventory works very much against this type of quests. The 'escape reapers' type-mini game or what it is, is just awful. And I don't know what they thought of bringing that into the game. And of course, the over shadowing ending, which invalidates and contradict much of the storyline from ME1 and ME2 (really obvious if playing all 3 in sequence). Makes most all of your choices throughout the previous game irrelevant. It did feel like leaving the game without an actual conclusion. The extended cut ending did not make matters much better, except as an insult to the fan groups which were disappointed. The DLCs for the game are decent, but no where near the quality of Lair of the Shadow Broker for ME2. Omega is very combat orientated, which is okay in itself, but it's not really Mass Effect. Leviathan felt tacked on and much more like an attempt to build an in-game foundation for the ending more than anything. Citadel fun, but eventually irrelevant as it feels strange to put that into the middle of an all out war for the survival of the universe as 'we' know it. But well it's a farewell and a last money grab by Bioware. Mass Effect 3 is a decent game. It's not an action-roleplaying as ME1 was. It's a better shooter than ME2, but it's properly too much shooter for many RPG fans, and not enough for the shooter fans. Bioware tried to grab both, but for what it could have been it falls tragically short of the target. Potential but lack of implementation. Bioware basically dropped the ball. It's worth a playthrough from the bargain bin, but knowing what I know now, I would not have bought it at release.",6,2013-03-07,PC,user

For example in order to get side quests you don't even talk to NPCs anymore, you simply overhear conversations. But ME2 had a saving grace, its story was still very strong. ME3 doesn't have that and its not just the ending. Main story is predictable and boring. Last but not least, your companions are simply not interesting this time. Their stories too. An average game, nothing to really set it apart from other shooters.",6,2013-02-24,PC,user

Anyway, it's a closing game, and because of that its great. have the flaws, but yet one of the best experience in 2012. And for being one of the best trilogy ever, deserves a 10 points.

The story was decent, even some characters were total clichés (Kai Leng the Asian space ninja for example...). The combat was slightly improved compared to ME1 and ME2, but the cover system remained a litttle crunchy. RPG elements felt a little less developed than in ME2 (Renegade options for example were pure evil...They could have balanced the reputation system a little more...). Everything else basically remained the same as it were in ME2. I think the developers stayed on a safe ground on purpose. The music and sound effect were really good. Now let's talk about the infamous ending. Well they really screwed this up, and the ""Extended cut"" did not really makes it much better (When I first finished the ME3 my gaming experience was ruined...They can not make that back anyways with some cheap slide show, sugar coating stuff!) About the indoctrination theory! I think the developers at one point (might ...not sure) wanted to implement it, but they did **** theory is now refused by Bioware and EA so it is not part of the original Canon.

Vilyn117,"This game rightfully earns a 7. And while I could just blabber on about the ending, the subpar game mechanics, and most of the horrendous design choices in general, I'll just sum this review up simply. Don't buy this game for a satisfying single player game, but it for co-op with your friends. Co-op is the only reason I own this game, with a whopping 500 hours played on it, it's fantastic. And with free DLC content being added, you can't go wrong. The MP is fantastic in my opinion, and while it doesn't feel ""like mass effect"" because it's a 3rd person horde mode and not a story driven emotional title, it's fantastically done.

KillerCornflake,"My first experience of the Mass effect series was through the second game in the trilogy, and that really did set the standard high straight from the off. I thought the best idea would most likely be to purchase the 1st game before playing the 3rd one as to account for decisions made throughout the saga. This turned out to be a rather meaningless venture as determined by Mass Effect 3. With the good, the graphics in this game are neat and arguably the best out of the bunch, it's polished and tidy with a few exceptions that require the gamer to overlook. Combat has been unstuck slightly from what in my view was a more static system in ME2 and ME1, refinement can be observed. With the bad then, bearing in mind that most fans of the series will (rightly so) compare this title to it's predecessors, thats what these points are based off. The dialogue options came as a shock to my system, they took away what made the previously fun and exciting conversation choices and beat them down to formulaic two way cutscenes. Even if a player is to explore every single option in a wheel with more than two choices, it merely serves as providing information that mostly accounts for the people who have never played ME before, this trend is also visible with BLATANT repetition of the lore of some species (geth quarian war) that it makes long term players sit and think 'hmm i knew that'. Compared with the other two games, the ""sidequests"" in ME3 are for the most part dull fetch and return tasks to introduce a feeling of galactic warfare, yet in actual fact it is just another way of EA herding people to spend money in a cash shop to upgrade for the multiplayer seeing as it is the easiest way to increase ""galactic readiness"" which is ESSENTIAL if you want to end up with a ""good ending"", i won't get into that one. In short ME3 takes a few steps forward in combat and graphics departments, even so these are still not perfect by any means, even small matters of convenience such as in ME2 your squadmate's ability they were using was highlighted on the tactical menu so you could see what you selected, here it's not, little things like that. ME3 takes a major step back in terms of dialogue choice, i can't even talk to my own companions without the game deciding when it it ""the right time"", even then i can only say a selection of similar phrases. I'd get the game purely for it being ME3 and the end of the series, but don't go in with a high expectation of it matching what you had come to expect.",5,2013-02-05,PC,user
alsec,"Mass Effect 3 will not force you to make tough decisions on a galactic scale. The RPG element from the first one has been taken away, and replaced with longer action packed combat. Having 3 games to tell a story, but leaving the player with an ending less desirable, greatly disappoints. If with those gripes, I give it a 7 because it is still a fun game, and the story leading up to the ending held me with suspense.

AlienSpaceBats,"Painfully disappointing, and I can't have been alone in expecting better. 50% of the game is mindless pandering and fan-service (unnecessary). Corners were cut and the game was clearly rushed out the door, worst: lies were told by members of the development team pre-release. Mass Effect 3 is a minefield of immersion-breaking lazy (or poor) coding, audio and graphic glitches, low res textures, no DirectX 11 support, horrible animations and embarassing, fan-fic quality writing. The dialogue wheel is now completely arbitrary and the auto-dialogue is very poor, the journal is an unusable mess (bordering on non-existent) and the game cannot correctly import a character file without it looking FUBAR. In terms of gameplay, the shooter element is better than ever (fluid, fast-paced), and action sequences are great fun (although BioWare's insistence to use the SPACEBAR for everything borders on the ridiculous). Dialogue in general is riddled with clichés (the line ""I'll sleep when I'm dead"" is actually spoken, without irony) and the less said about the god-awful ending the better. Despite all this, the game is enjoyable at key points and some semblance of what-could-have-been is glimpsed during the Sur'Kesh, Tuchunka and Rannoch missions, however this means the game peaks halfway through before taking a nosedive. Special mention should go to the soundtrack artists (Sam Hulick especially) and the fantastic cut-scene direction, Most surprisingly though, the much dreaded multiplayer (pre-release) turned out to be an excellent addition that for me has extended Mass Effect's life by 9 months (and counting).",6,2013-02-04,PC,user
Bryjoered,"God this game just isn't very good at all and seeing it in the top 10 for 2012 kind of sickens me. Yes, the combat is equally as fun, maybe a little more fun that its predecessors, but the skill system is this stripped down 3rd person shooter now. Also, the great storylines and side missions that were the absolute best part about the first two games are pretty absent from this one. The side missions are so dull and I just rush through them not caring at all about my dialogue choices, and the main story is pretty sub-par as well. Let's all face it, Bioware has sold their souls to make some cheap bucks. It started with the horrendous Dragon Age 2 and now this. Don't even get me started on DA2 and how much of a fail that was considering how phenomenal the first entry was.",6,2013-01-31,PC,user
Ziamboni,"Could be perfect, but is only great. Positives: Main plot is just epic, great and awesome Gameplay is finally refined, making this a fun shooter Emotionally impacting story AMAZING soundtrack As always great voice-acting (especially Mark Meer, Brendan Keener (sp?), Keith David) Javik! Quite good multiplayer, even if lacking Negatives: Scrapping of old characters (most of the characters from ME2 are only featured in cameos Side-quests aren't as good as they were in ME2 (still better than ME1) DAT ENDING, really WTF. Some plot points were left hanging (dark energy, proto-reaper from collector base, actually whole collector base decision is nonexistant) Handling of MAJOR decisions leaves much to be desired (Rachni queen, already mentioned collector base, rewriting/destroying geth etc) Aside from the main ENDING cutscenes, the last mission (priority: earth) which was advertised to DEATH is the worst, most boring missions in whole trilogy. I highly recommend the game, even in its flaws it's an amazing conclusion to epic trilogy. TBH, if the last mission (Priority:Earth) wasn't so lack-luster, noone would mind the **** endings. Here's hoping for Priority:Earth DLC",8,2013-01-28,PC,user

THEY FIXED IT. and if you are still upset about the endings not being that different from each other, then you have not been paying attention to the other endings to the Mass Effect series. These ending are in the same type as the first 2 games. To give the review a 0 just because of the ending is stupid. Here is why, if the game was so bad to earn a 0, then you would never finish it to see the endings! The rating is base on and OVERALL experience. The game was a very fun play.

DeadlyVeggie,"Spoilers on the ending: Look, moral choices are good, but having a 'Good' and 'Bad' scale to regulate them, is horrible. Thus, the paragon/renegade polarization is a terrible mechanic. HOWEVER, the ending to this series is its redeemer. Having absolutely everything burn is a way to hold up the small moral choices of the series as ultimately pointless. The binary morality of the series is therefore undermined.

ActionBastard,"Perhaps one of the most unfortunate games in existence, both because it could never stand up to the expectations of fans and because it was played off by its creators and dozens of invested parties within gaming journalism as the second coming of Christ. It is a mediocre sequel and a disappointing finale to a well-loved series. Most unfortunate of all, however, is the way in which it and several other big-name titles of the last few years have come to represent the baldfaced corruption and lack of integrity within the video game industry. Games should judged as good based on their own merit, not on how many reviewers the publisher can manage to bribe. I give this game a four, for ""bad."" I would have given it an ""average"" of 6, but I subtracted one point for the paid-for reviews and one point for the way Bioware instructed journalists to attack their more critical fans. I regret having to look beyond the game itself and into the murk that surrounds it, but as the games industry continue to make video games less about games and more about the surrounding hype and media buzz, I have no choice but to add those factors to my score.

vazait,"This game is not good as an RPG, it's not good as a cover-based shooter, and it's certainly not good as a hybrid of any sort. This game is atrocious, it truly is. And this comes from someone who liked ME2, despite its flaws. But anyways, what's wrong with the game? Well, I think the ridicilous ending has been covered well enough by a lot of other reviewers, so I won't go into detail on how stupid it was. Let's talk about the dumbed down dialogue instead. BioWare and EA apparently thought three choices as a standard was a bit overwhelming when playing ME1&2, so they had to remove the middleground. What is left is the **** and ""Good Guy"" options, and the occasional Renegade and Paragon option. The Renegade & Paragon system is also pretty stupid. 'If you aren't nice to people, you can't make rational choices'... The **** kind of sense does that make? And with the removal of dialogue options, comes the removal of dialogue too. Which I can see makes all kinds of sense. Why would you shift the focus from shooting endless hordes of Cerberus troops, over on the thoughts and psyche of the interesting and beloved crew. We all know thats why we loved the original games, right? It was the neverending cover-based shooting that attracted us all... ... right? With all irony aside, I find it pretty annoying that the crew is even less talkable in the third installment, than in the second. In like 19 hours, I had the total of THREE, unique dialogues with Liara (whom I had romanced in the previous games), whereas only TWO of them were private and on the Normandy. That kinda ****, especially since she's one of my favourite characters in the entire series. Also: what's up with the character design? How come everyone dresses in the sexiest ""armor"" in the entire universe? Don't get me wrong, I am in fact a fan of the female body. But, why did Ashley throw away her giant power armor from ME1, in favor of the sleek, sexy outfit in the third? It looks stupid, and it doesn't make sense. But if she hadn't changed the armor, it would be significantly less time to show of her enlarged bazoongas. I'm not **** you when I say that the size of her **** have been increased from the first game. The entire game is so sexualized it just becomes silly. And to top it all off, they had to make EDI sexy too. I'm actually surprised she isn't a romance option. It would go along with the rest of this **** **** perfectly. And while we're at EDI: what's her deal? Why does she act so out of character? She's not an AI, but she acts like one. When I think about, practically everyone acts out of character. The only one who doesn't do so, is Harbinger. He does the best job of sticking to his... 'personality' and agenda in the entirety of the game. Even Shepard acts out of character. What's the deal with the homosex-romance? I don't dislike homosexuals in any way, but the sudden change of sexuality is just weird. So, is there ANYTHING good about the game, you may ask. Well, kind of. The skill system is decent, better than ME2's (worse than ME1's). The weapons and attachments are pretty good, I prefer it over both the first and second installments' take on it. The armor and armor customization is vastly superior to both 1&2, so there are some good things about the game. One could say it looks pretty too - and I somewhat agree, but you feel like you don't always belong there. The game shows off what it can do and how beautiful it is, and sometimes, one ends up just as a watcher. My final complaint is in regards to Cerberus. Why did the story shift the focus away from the Reapers, and onto Cerberus? I don't feel like I'm saving the galaxy most of the time when I'm playing. Battling wave after wave of Cerberus-troops isn't fun, it doesn't make you feel like you're saving the galaxy, and it only makes you wonder why you are bothering with it. Feels kinda like busywork. All in all, this is one of the most disappointing games I have ever encountered. Mass Effect was one of my favorite games, and together with sequel one of my favourite game series. But now I can't even thoroughly enjoy the first installments, because I know it will all be in ""vain"", as this game is so butt****ingly stupid. This game is abominable. Steer clear away from this thing. The only reason this game isn't getting 1/10, is because it has Liara, Tali and Garrus in it (even though none of them want to speak with me).",2,2013-01-05,PC,user

ME2 allowed you to side with Cerberus as a renegade, now Cerberus are hardcoded as the bad guys because they're indoctrinated.

JustinForgueims,"Awesome game. The gameplay is almost perfect. Challenging combats, many options to face them. Many companions, elections and builds. All the scenarios are well done and unique. They removed the car/exploration sections that were so boring. Sprint duration was also fixed. Decoding minigames also removed. So only one annoying thing remains that's the artifacts exploration feature. There are lots of stories, side quests, companions quests, and most of them are fascinating and are driving bigger plot changes than ever. As usual in the franchise the dialogs are well written and interesting. There are still many dialog selections pointing to the same result or maybe not the expected one. The DLCs contribute with good stories and worth content. Historically many people complained about the overall story and specifically the endings.

Ciocolici,"""Mass Effect 3"" stands out as one of the finest games I've had the privilege to dive into, and it serves as an exceptional conclusion to the trilogy. In terms of gameplay, it truly shines as the pinnacle of the series thus far. It's a package that feels complete, leaving me hard-pressed to find anything I'd want to alter. The seamless progression of the story, the intricate decisions that shape the narrative, the electrifying moments that get the heart racing, and the remarkable depth of the characters – all of these aspects are masterfully executed. While I'm well aware of the backlash the ending faced within the fanbase, I must say I don't share that sentiment. Personally, I found no issues with it. Instead, I found the ending enjoyable and genuinely satisfying. The legacy of Mass Effect is undeniable; it has firmly established itself as one of the standout video game series.

It's high points are among the highest of any in Bioware's catalogue, but there are so many narrative problems surrounding them. Bioware couldn't make key friends too relevant to the game because they may be dead from the prior game, leaving many of the games most emotionally engaging stories a little listless. It has incredible peaks in its writing and incredible valleys, and has largely lost track of the original themes of the first game.

Hochbichler,"Mass Effect 3 is the third installment of the legendary Mass Effect sci-fi action RPG game series, released in 2012 it also concludes the Mass Effect Shepherd trilogy. In Mass Effect 3, I got the feeling that everything is smooth and polished when compared to its predecessors. Well everything except the ending obviously. But otherwise I really enjoyed this game, the missions are more plentiful, more diverse, more interesting, the interactions and relationships with your squadmates are as great as they always were. The story itself is pretty predictable but individual missions are very interesting with important choices to be made. Graphics is similar to ME2, but still very nice, polished and likeable. Game font is also pleasing to the eye. Music is nonintrusive and well chosen (Bad Choices). The range of story choices is maybe a little bit more limited than in ME2, but it still offers a great variability. The only trouble with this game is the ending. Upon the game release back in 2012, the ending was just a joke and even with two DLCs and a lot of fixing and polishing, it is still mediocre and unmemorable, specially for a great trilogy like Mass Effect. Such a trilogy deserved better. It is a pity that there is no peaceful path when dealing with Cerberus, it just seems maybe a little bit too extreme for Shepherd to switch like that and really hate Cerberus in ME3. Also maybe the events between ME1 / ME2 and also ME2 / ME3 could have been explained in more details. But these are minor and mostly personal problems. It is worth noting that this trilogy is really supposed to be played as such and jumping straight into ME3 without a previous save from ME2 and knowledge of the events of the previous games would be inadvisable. Microtransactions are present in the mild form of overpriced DLCs. SJW nonsense is maybe a tiny bit more apparent than in the previous games, but still nothing major. DLCs: Leviathan - The first true story DLC released for ME3. It is well written, with dark atmosphere and a few surprises along the way. This DLC is very important for the main story of ME3 and indeed the whole trilogy, so much so, that this should have absolutely been part of the base game and not a DLC. Otherwise worthy story DLC. Verdict: 70% Omega - The second story DLC for ME3. It takes you back to Omega, which you no doubt know and love from ME2. Its a classic optional story DLC with very little ties to the main story. This time you cannot take any squadmates with you and instead you play with Aria and her ""friend"". Omega is fun and the only real downside is the price. Its about three times as much as I would consider appropriate. Verdict: 75% Citadel - The third and last story DLC for ME3. This time the developers decided to do something different and allowed Shepherd and his crew to take a break from fighting the reapers and relax. Well mostly. I would separate this DLC into three parts. The first one is the story itself, which takes you around the Citadel and forces you to fight your own clone. The second part is the Silversun strip, which is basically a mall with a bar, a casino, an arcade and an arena. All these are fun to play with plus you can find your friends on the strip and spend some quality and fun time with them. The last part is a big party that you can throw in your new apartment. This whole DLC is definitely leaning towards comedy and it is filled with jokes and puns. It fits very well towards the end of ME3 and the entire trilogy and the developers really made the best out of all the relationships you built during your playthrough. It really works for Citadel and it makes you feel almost nostalgic. The price is more appropriate for this DLC than for Omega, but still a little too much for my taste. All in all a great DLC. Final verdict: 92 % I personally enjoyed Mass Effect 3 very much, the meh ending did not spoil nor diminish the hundreds of hours of great fun I had playing this fantastic trilogy.

Nekrips,"The final part of the legendary trilogy. In my opinion, it absorbed the good qualities of the previous two parts and added some of its own innovations. The plot in this part has become the most epic and large-scale in the entire trilogy. All your decisions made in the previous parts will affect the overall course of the story. Although the ending rightfully raised a lot of questions for many, the story itself and its development throughout the trilogy are the best in the history of games. The plot captivates you from the very beginning, and excellent DLCs will help to better reveal the full depth of the story. The gameplay has not changed much. The combat system is also top-notch. Graphically, the game has received some improvements. The music in this part is the best of the entire trilogy. The perfect conclusion to the legendary trilogy, despite the controversial ending.",10,2022-08-12,PC,user

MaxSteelRocks,Personally I felt it was the best of the entire series. The gameplay was a huge improvement over the previous two. Environments were just as beautiful as the first game. Missions weren't as good as ME2 but I still enjoyed them. Characters felt flushed out but weren't a total letdown. For me the ending really came together for me and really summed up the previous two games meanings. It felt like the end of 7th gen for me.,10,2022-05-09,PC,user

kyle20ellis,"Greetings from Lithuania. ""Mass Effect 3"" (2012) is a superb game for everyone who enjoyed the previous two installments. Maybe it is not as addictive as Mass Effect 2, but it is a superb game in every direction, with amazing story, great game play, great RPG elements ant etc. There are some issues with controls in close combat, but those are mind issues in comparison to a whole view - a SCI epic on biggest proportions. I do loved the original ending, never played alternative one. Overall, ""Mass Effect 3"" is a great game and a great conclusion of a saga.

Ltom,"Mass Effect 3 is a mess of overdesign and copying from other games it has no job copying from. For clarities sake, I played this game right after I finished Mass Effect 1 and 2. And I got to say, it is by far the weakest Mass Effect game I've played. Playing this game feels like seeing a good friend go down a depression spiral, it's unfocused, it's pacing is trash, character's personalities are changed to make this whole game feel more like gears of war and the expendables, instead of what Mass Effect was. It's not all bad of course, it does have it's moments, like any other game does. And it is a really good experience when it wants to be. The problem is, it doesn't want to be good often. The new characters are also painfully bad, such as james who I wish I could let die from the first mission. Or cortez who is a semi replacement for joker, only worse and way more annoying than he has any right to be (but he can die on the final mission so that gave me a smile at least). When Mass Effect 3 is good is when it is actually Mass Effect. When you hang around with Garrus, Tali, Liara. You know, the usual suspects, and have fun. It does happen a lot and before playing the casino DLC party ending, I was going to give this game a 1 or 0 out of 10. But I have to admit that, no matter how disappointed I am in this game, and no matter how much I disliked most of the game. It does have those moments that put a smile on your face and a tear in your eye. So, for that alone I'll give it a 4. I don't think it worth more than that and I will get into it later. For now, let's focus on the pros and cons. Pros: Biotics have nicer effects and some biotics that used to not have much impact in the game now feel a lot better. Gunplay is arguably better. Cons: The characters introduced in the third game are borderline horrendous, with the exception of traynor. Other than that, they are either forgettable or asinine. The pacing of the story is way off, it tries to give this sense of urgency that is destroyed the moment you stop to find cables for some random schmuck Old characters you know and love turn into action movie protagonist level of dumb and annoying sometimes. Something that's fine for the new ones (since that's what they are supposed to be I guess), but not for the older ones who where never like that. Shepard feels weird when compared to other games of the series. He feels disconnected and turns into a military **** only to make a 180 in the final mission. Which leads me to believe that there was some push from EA to make him like that. But I wouldn't know and assuming gets us nowhere (nor does it change the fact). Side missions and companions feel ""weaker"" than in previous titles (not combat wise, story wise). That's for the big ones, in my opinion. I could go on about how the gameplay feels clunky and a bad ripoff from gears of war, or how the game forces you to interact with characters you don't want to, or how everybody talks too much all the **** time. ""Oh, here's a ladder, oh here's the door) it's like a constant tutorial. A constant tutorials I didn't and for and don't want. Or how military mumbo jumbo makes every dialogue feel stupid and annoying and how there are less than half dialogue options, compared to ME2. But, I digress. The main problem with ME3 is that it trying to be something it's not. It's trying to be gears of war and the expendables, when it should have just be something more akin to band of brothers. And it works when it is more like it, that's the frustrating part, they know how to make the game good and just didn't. The voice acting is a toss frankly, some voice acting is amazing and some is trash with everything in between. The ending is something that will divide opinions a lot. As a starters, I love bitter endings. I like it when the ending puts a tear in my eye, when someone isn't making it back this time. The last hurrah! If you will. So the ending isn't something I completely dislikes and there is some amazing award worthy voice acting in the final mission in my opinion. But that is not enough to carry this one home I'm afraid. For context. I 100% this game in 35 hours (roughly 3-4 I was afk but just go with it) and for 20-24 of them I was out of my mind, pissed off with how they treated the old characters and the fact that I had to interact with the new, annoying, boring, pieces of **** they put in the story. I got the """"""good"""""" ending with 8000 military strength points (you don't need that much you need 7400 I believe) and I would be lying if I said that I didn't like doing any of it. Or that I wasn't sentimental in the final mission. But it's just not enough. So, I can't in good faith recommend this game. If you want to play it for the trilogy, do it. However, be prepared to be disappointed a lot of times. That's that... Hopefully the new one will be better though I wouldn't hold my breath. Oh, one last thing.

Broyax,"Mass Effect et son univers éveillent une affection particulière : après tout le héros Shepard porte le nom (hasard ou coïncidence ?) du premier Américain lancé dans l’espace, un type éclipsé par ceux qui sont allés sur la lune… Et quand on a un vaisseau beau comme le Concorde (un Concorde de l’espace) et qui s’appelle en plus « Normandy » comme notre feu vaisseau Normandie, ça sent bon le camembert tout ça (et j’adore toujours un bon calendos fabriqué… en Normandie). Troisième fois que je le termine (après deux fois sur 360) et l’interface de la version PC est à mi-chemin entre celle du premier Mass Effect (très bien pensée) et celle du deux. Toujours pas de manette mais un jour peut-être, ils comprendront chez Bioware, qui sait… c’est parce qu’ils préfèrent les consoles et ma foi, je les comprends un peu quelque part. Toujours est-il que le bond graphique est très sensible depuis Mass Effect 2 : le moteur Unreal est parfaitement maîtrisé et ça tourne tout à fond à 60 im/s. Pas mal pour un jeu du début 2012. Quelle conclusion en tout cas que ce Mass Effect 3 : passionnante, grandiose, épique ! cette remarque ne concerne pas la toute fin elle-même… mais je vais y revenir. A la narration parfaitement orchestrée s’ajoutent des combats décidément parfaits (et encore plus tactiques) une ambiance sonore au sommet, une musique (toujours électro en majorité) réussie, une mise en scène stupéfiante et un doublage français impeccable. J’ai essayé le mode multi-joueur qui fait malgré toutes les tentatives de Bioware, très pièce rapportée mais qui remplit son office de passe-temps vaguement divertissant et parfaitement inutile dans un jeu de rôle… et très optionnelle heureusement. Reste que s’appliquer sur cet aspect a eu un effet positif sur la maniabilité excellente durant les combats -on dit ça bien sûr pour se rassurer, tout ce temps passé sur le multi ne l’a pas été sur le solo… Et à cet égard, la fin aurait mérité davantage d’attention… car si la fin étendue -ou enrichie- précise quelques points qui restaient flous ou sujets à l’interprétation, elle n’en demeure pas moins…. toujours décevante ! ou plutôt devrais-je dire les fins, lequelles ne tiennent de toute façon pas debout, quel que soit le bout par lequel on les prenne. En tous les cas, malgré cet écueil (des fins merdiques) quelle joie de finir (et refinir) cette trilogie avec le même personnage et toutes les décisions que l’on a pu prendre et d’en voir les effets se perpétuer en cascade d’un épisode à l’autre ! on ne s’en lasse pas et c’est toujours la nostalgie qui vous prend les tripes lorsqu’on se remémore les personnages, les batailles et les décisions de Mass Effect 3 !",9,2021-06-08,PC,user

Why? Because this just ist the least interesting game in the trilogy.. it just is.. you already know which charcters you like in this universe.. and there aren’t really anymore to fall in love with before the big showfdown.. so I just didn’t care to do the side missions, especially with just how repetitive the main campaign felt.. why would i? I had no insentive to explore and go do more.. that being said mass Efect 3 is decently enjoyable to play through.. You will get more squadmembers as the story goes on, youll be picking out their special abilities, and they do become an important part of your arsenal.. for example Liara was a stple for me to deal with annoying shielded enemies, I loved how on command I could have her just throw any enmy in the eir right in front of me.. so it really is up to you to baance your squad of 3 to your play style.. I do wish however there was more information given to me before a mission s maybe I was more throughful about the 2nd member… if I ever had anyone different it was mostly because the tory forced it on me.. in general mass effect 3 does an awful job at pre gaming… you have to chose your loadout before you go in.. having no idea what youll be dealing with ahead of time.. it makes literally 0 sense for me to not change my loadout based on my current situation on the fly… it ultimately lead to me not relly trying out any guns after I had one I was pretty satisfied… If mass Effect 3 werent the bow ontop of a series I had to see the end of after a huge investment into 1 and 2… I probably wouldn’t have been so invested to see it through.. it lies on the shoulders of the success of the perevious games and sadly doesn’t live up to the world building standards they set… While I did enjoy going through this campaign and putting an end to this intergalactic war… by itself, mass effect 3 isnt all that great.

Antictra,"9 years after: I played the game just when it was released in march 2012, had a part in the ""ending war"" with EA and Bioware, replayed game again anno domini 2021 under covid curfews. My vision did not change that much since 2012: Mass Effect 3 was a magnificent ride as it followed and given a closure to so many emotional story arcs, just like a flawless ""Rachnia sound symphony"" just up to the last 5 minutes of the game spoiled and corrupted by the ""reapers"". Whoever they were, they were severely punished back in 2012 and then again for Anthem occasion. The inconsistent pacing of the very ending with the rest of game is still there and will remain forever, even though certain mods give the possibility to somehow limit it's ""cliffhanger feeling"". I would describe it as solipsistic, not because of the sense of its' different variants but because of its delivery, completely out of place and logic of the rest of the game. Beyond that ME3 has the very nice flow both in gameplay mechanics and storytelling, while giving a certain liberty of action, influence on the events and characters in that vibrant, fascinating world. Stylistically original it will remain for a long time in the minds and hearts of the players. Clearly I recommend to play the game for itself, while being prepared for not satisfying ending. Remaining and recurrent problem with EA's game is its intrusive DRM and selling the 9 years old bare game with no DLC. Now they plan their new legendary edition, yet, while it may be interesting for new players, for old ones it risks to be an expensive acquisition (and still with intrusive DRM).",8,2021-03-07,PC,user

19magathann,"Would've gotten a 10 if not for the horrendous tactic of Galactic Readiness that forces the player to play an inoffensively passable multiplayer experience that drags on for over 10 hours, then regresses at far too fast of a rate in order to ""encourage"" the player to buy microtransactions. The general plot of the game is fantastic up until the final 30 minutes, but I've forgiven this egregious error since BioWare remade the ending in order to fix up the blatant plot holes. I also hate the idea of taking out crucial story elements such as ""Awakening"" and ""Leviathan"" and selling them as Day 1 DLC, a tactic still used by AAA developers and publishers in order to promote Season Passes. It's a scumbag move to nickel and dime your fans out of the full experience. Stop it, EA. While my first and third point mostly have to do with EA being greedy, the parts of the game that BioWare was responsible for are the gold standard of gaming. If there was more time for BioWare to create the game they envisioned, maybe the game would've been better received by everyone, and it is generally a damn shame that the ending of the game is so talked about, it obscures every other strength and weakness the game has. Since I've already talked about it's weaknesses, let's talk about it's strengths. In spite of losing the main writer for the last two games, every story and character plot is satisfactorily concluded in some way or another. Depending on how you played Mass Effect 2, you can either rekindle relationships with your friends or visit new (and admittedly more dull) characters that fulfill the same role. Every side plot has a firm conclusion to it that still has dire consequences based on the choices you make, and the combat is unmatched in my opinion. Even more enemies than before, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, power weapons strategically placed to turn the tide of battle, squad controls that make the game so satisfying to play even 8 years later, and even though the spacebar is overutilized for movement, the movement itself it drastically improved from the clunky and slow paced movement in Mass Effect 2 and 1. This game is excellent if you removed the final 30 minutes, and deep down, you know it's true, too. I'll be the first to criticize BioWare for their egregious mishandling of the ending, their refusal to address the ending to anyone, and even how they botched Andromeda beyond repair, but at the source, this is EA's fault for rushing the game and being greedy pigs. 9/10; excellent game.",9,2020-09-28,PC,user

The gameplay is very similar to ME2, in fact, it is just more ME2 but more refined which could be seen as pretty lazy and **** by some, but for me, I thought of it as an if it isn't broke don't fix it type of situation and to be completely honest the amazing writing and story were the real highlight of the game which also overshadowed the samey combat from the previous games. The multiplayer was also really enjoyable and replayable. Overall I would rate this game a 10/10 a real must-play for everyone!",10,2020-08-28,PC,user

JamesDrawsThngs,"Mass Effect 3 is the concluding chapter in the Commander Shepard trilogy and one of the most controversial games of the past decade. The amount of disappointment and anger that this game managed to generate is immeasurable. This, along with the disappointing Dragon Age 2, **** away every ounce of good will that Bioware generated. Almost a decade has passed since ME3's release, and its sting can still be felt today. ME3 is a game that has sadly gotten worse over time. However, I do not believe this is a bad game. Far from it. The Reapers have successfully invaded the galaxy, and now Shepard has to do their part to unite the different races together in an effort to stop the Reapers, all the while building the ultimate Deus Ex Machina known as The Crucible that could possibly be used to stop them for good. The quality of the storytelling is very sporadic. One moment I'm face-palming at how moronic and out-of-character someone is, or how contrived, awkward or force another moment can be, but then be greeted with moments of pure awesomeness, spectacle, or just plain heart-warming. However, what this game is most infamous for lies within its conclusion. In its original state, the endings truly are awful. No question about it. All of the choices you've made, the characters you've grown to love, the alliances you have built. All of that gets practically wasted by the final """"decisions"""" Shepard is forced to choose from. If you invested your time and energy into this series for the five years it had been going on up to that point, absolutely you would feel demoralized by this moment. Bioware did attempt to remedy this a bit with the release of an Extended Cut that was meant to add further closure and explanations for certain details (all the while creating new questions that shouldn't be there). It certainly was a much needed patch job, but that's all it was. It still didn't fully fix the issues that the game's conclusion suffered from, and it will forever be remembered for that. While there are still plenty of big choices to be made throughout the game, most of them are within the context of the previous two games, rather than ones made for this game exclusively. Gameplay has received both improvements and detriments. Out of the original trilogy, I definitely think that this has the best combat. The movement options feel more refined, the levels are a little more open-ended, organic and less ""video-gamey"", the gunplay feels ultra satisfying and the weapon upgrade system adds an extra layer of depth. They also managed to find a strong compromise with the level up system. It's not as in-depth as ME1, but not nearly as stripped down as ME2. The probing mini-game is now just a simple ""find dot on the map and poke it"" and snag the item. The game also benefits from some great looking environments and some of the best voice acting in the series. The gameplay detriments, though, are pretty egregious. Firstly, the sidequest structure in this game is terrible. You get most of your sidequests by just eavesdropping on peoples' incredibly private conversations, then you go out on the galaxy map, find the thing and bring it back. If that sounds tedious to you, you'll be *happy* to know that the codex does NOT keep track of mission completion! If you get sidetracked in the middle of a mission, or just put the game down for a while and forget about it, you are not going to know how far along you are unless you retrace your steps to make sure you got everything. You would need to do a sidequest on its own to completion with no distractions just to make sure you do it right. Hell, a few of the quests don't even bother telling you the location of a planet, and unless you look up a guide you're gonna have to scour the entire galaxy just to find the damn thing. That is bad game design. The dialogue wheel also reduces your choices between paragon and renegade, with no in-between. The war asset system, while neat in concept, is poorly executed and, unless you have the EC and story DLCs, all but force you to engage in multiplayer if you want to achieve the best possible outcome. The best way to describe ME3 would be ""sporadic"". It shifts back and forth between stupidity and brilliance, fun and tedium. I still honestly believe it's a solid game, in spite of its faults, but I don't blame anyone for being soured by it.",7,2020-07-31,PC,user
n_dhruvo,Me 3 is the final installment of shepard trilogy. A satisfying conclusion and the last good mass effect in the franchise. The ending was very disappointing which made the fans upset.

I love the mass effect series and the third part is really felt the weakest in many respects due to the poor ending. The dialogue system also disappointed me, it got worse. But otherwise the game is very good. But the most important thing in the last part of the series was to be the ending and it failed. The motivation of the antagonists was poorly disclosed, and this also plays a big role. Screenwriter Drew Karpyshyn had great ideas about the whole plot of the mass effect, but his great ideas were ignored. I am disappointed, but the game does not deserve such low ratings.

It is very similar to the Mass Effect 2, it recovers the engine, the scenography (the Normandy is practically the same, with some modifications and new rooms). I would name this as Mass Effect 2.5. But there are overall improvements and, of course, a new story that goes on and conclude the epic story. I am not against the ending, it is an end and you have also opportunity to have some different ends. To some can like it, to some one else not. It is a end. But for the great universe, the plot, the love story (i loved the one with Liara that i followed from the first chapter), let me feel really the emotions as a great movie/book/story should do.

Gearetic,"I've recently taken it upon myself to replay through the entire trilogy back to back and I suppose I have to be the one to say it: Mass Effect 3 is not a bad game. Shocking, I know. The user review score would have you believe this is some sort of failure but you have to understand the context of these reviews, especially now, years after release when everything has settled. Mass Effect 3 was the very first sign of EA's descent into madness that Bioware unfortunately got caught up in. This is the first single player game that featured the now notorious micro-transaction system we all despise. These monetization methods and publisher meddling have proven to be game killers, and Mass Effect 3 was the first warning we got. Couple that with an unfortunate handling of the game's ending sequence that resulted in the outrage and barrage of negative reviews you now see before you. With all that said, I can now begin to explain why this game is actually fantastic and still worth your time. VIsuals: The visuals in ME3 are a significant upgrade to the previous entries. Although it definitely is not ahead of it's time in any way, we have to remember that ME1 came out in 2007 and somehow looked worse than a lot of games from 2 years prior. This is a third person RPG, meaning that it is not beholden to the standards of a linear FPS, let's say. Even so, the visuals in ME3 somehow manage not to look particularly dated even close to 2020. That said, there are still some issues that permeate throughout the entire trilogy. The animations tend to look very stiff and awkward a lot of the time and the facial animations leave a lot to be desired. In fact, I can't say the quality of the animations changed much at all since the first game, leaving most of the characters looking pretty deadpan even in an RPG that is 80% all about character interactions. Another issue are all the character models besides the important, handcrafted ones. All the ME games have used the same shoddy system of generating side characters that ends up making human NPC's look laughably unrealistic compared to any of the main characters. Everything else, however, the visual style, textures, lighting, environments and most of the models do their job well. Gameplay: This is where ME3 truly surpasses its predecessors. The previous games have been little more in terms of their gameplay than sitting behind cover, poping up to shoot every now and then and casting the odd ability to kill things faster. Sometimes you would have to leave cover and find a different place to shoot from. It felt horrendous in ME1, it was significantly changed and improved in ME2 and ME3 combines elements of both and improves them further. While ME1's RPG mechanics were certainly more fleshed out than the actual combat, ME2 was kind of in reverse, with less options for customization and more emphasis on quality of combat, which worked surprisingly well in that game. ME3 has both, with more options and returning features from the original along with a much tighter and more intense combat system that gives enough wiggle room to actually become good at the game. With the now much expanded arsenal of weapons, mods and equipment, all of which feel different to use, they give you the freedom to tailor your experience to your preferred play style. Firing weapons in this game feels amazing and chaining that with dodging, running, meleeing, and using powers all flow wonderfully together. My only issue is that the enemies feel a bit too bullet-spongey. Story: This is where it gets tricky. The overall quality of the writing is about the same as in ME2. So that's great. Right? Well, it is but the caveat here is that ending. I've never actually experienced the endings of the vanilla game, which was said to be not only lacking in variety, but also confusing and open-ended. Not good for capping off a complete trilogy. That's the thing though, they actually IMPROVED the ending via DLC by changing or providing additional scenes and context. That's something at least and they didn't need to do it either. They could have just left it where it was and not bother correcting their mistake so I appreciate their corrective efforts with the added complaint that it did not need to happen in the first place if they had done it properly the first time. It is not unfair to mention that ME3 has some of the most memorable and epic moments in the series and features what is probably one of my all time favorite DLC campaigns. The one in question is the Citadel DLC, which is absolutely bonkers in terms of its tone and narrative compared to anything we've seen in the series and I love it. To sum up, ME3 is an excellent game that has made some mistakes and rectified a lot of them. So long as you get the version of the game that includes all of the DLC and ignore any and all MTX's, you are in for a great experience, provided you've played the previous games of course",8,2019-12-03,PC,user

Gameplay is smooth and fun and there are a number of highpoints to the story, with breathtaking scenes like the threshew maw–Reaper face-off on Tuchanka or the arrival of the allied fleets to the Solar System. The Citadel and Leviathan DLCs are great, deepening and extending the story, lore and character arcs. The controversy about the ending is quite absurd. I agree that the original endings, before the Extended Cut DLC, were lackluster, but the amended endings are fine. Unless ME3 is the only game you have played in your life, you cannot honestly say that the way ME3 ends is somehow beyond the pale. The writing in ME3 is head and shoulders above almost everything else in gaming; getting angry over endings of most games would be an improvement given that the stories of most games are too silly and forgettable for anyone to give a second thought to them. The only thing I can really fault the endings of ME3 for is that by giving the player so much choice over the future of the Milky Way, BioWare made sequels set in the Milky Way impossible, giving us the dud that is Mass Effect: Andromeda.",10,2019-03-08,PC,user

post_no_bills,"A very strange combination of bad design and good execution. It's a difficult game to review. And I suppose that reviewing it at this late date is pointless, but it feels sort of cathartic. I just finished playing (and ""finished"" in this context means ""gave up on"") Mass Effect: Andromeda, and thought I would go back and give this one another try. Time has, I believe, given a bit more perspective on ME3, and of course the added DLC has provided more depth. The individual elements of the game are actually pretty good. The graphics are good, the combat is good, the DLC is good, the game is generally well engineered. But these, mostly (excepting the DLC), are generally just incremental improvements from the last games. And then, unfortunately, there are the creative aspects. The creative decisions on story arc, the choices on companions, and - of course - the ending. Those are simply disappointing. I found it more that a bit disappointing that almost all the romantic interests from ME2 were effectively cut from ME3. Well, OK, not ""cut"" per se, but reduced in scope to meaningless. So much for emotional investment. It was also more than a bit disappointing that all of your choices narrowed down to...nothing. Good or evil, everyone ends up in the exact same place. That certainly makes a mockery of any choices you agonized over, as well as failing to align with any of the world's religions. Again, so much for emotional investment. Lastly, the ending. I will admit that the revisions they made after release changed the ending from absolutely terrible to simply disappointing, but disappointing nonetheless. So...a serviceable game, but not the equal of its predecessors. Disappointing. So...ME3...Andromeda...after killing two games I wonder what Mac Walters is doing now?",5,2018-03-04,PC,user

The combat is the best in the series and the game just keeps upping the stakes until you get to the point everyone is dissatisfied with. Sure, I wouldn't have minded more effort put into large number of outcomes that would be possible in the end but overall most of it does not matter because it should not matter. This whole game was a huge undertaking and i appreciate everything that went into the final product... even if it let some areas fall by the wayside.

VeryNoob,"I spent more than 160 hours in this trilogy. Bought all available DLCs to date, always bought the most complete version of the game. And as a such hardcore Mass Effect fan I must say that I'm nothing more than sad. I had high expectation towards the trilogy ending. But ME3 did the impossible, they just screwed up the series. I can't do anything but laugh from some magazine reviews that says that ME3 is a proper ending to the series. Sadly many reviews don't even understand the idea behind the game, or just forgotten how awesome ME and ME2 were. The user's score can't lie, just compare ME and ME2 user's score to this one.. it speaks by itself. The combat is too much simplified, the game is about go to the planets, scan, delivery assets and sometimes do some mission. And that's it, no epic bosses, no epic battles, even my last section of game had a taste of ""common battle"". The games looks rushed, no proper characters involvement... Didn't think Bioware would miss twice.. first my deception with Dragon Age 2, now this? Why would you guys screw up Mass Effect? It's supposed to be THE epic trilogy. Be the benchmark, the reference to follow, simply the best. But today, Mass Effect is just one more. The 3/10 score is due to the hard work I saw in Bioware trying to do the game, sadly the execution failed. A lot.",3,2017-06-22,PC,user

MeritCoba,"Is the Mass Effect trilogy as good as people make it out to be when criticizing Andromeda? I haven't played Andromeda, so I can't say from experience how good or bad it is, but to say that the Mass Effect Trilogy was better seems to me more an attempt to spite Andromeda rather than draw a fair comparison. Take ME 3 as an example. Rehash of Lord of the Rings. All the mass effect episodes based on Lord of the Rings. There is a threat on an epic scale against which only you can do something special to defeat it(ME1: Conduit; ME2: IFF, ME3: Crucible). Nobody appreciates the seriousness of the threat, either because nobody believes you(ME1) or trusts you(ME2/3) or because of politics(ALL). You have to gather forces and support often against the odds(ALL). The enemy always has some very powerful fighters(Ringwraiths) and corrupts your allies(ALL). Every next episode you have lost your hero status and nobody believes you even though by ME3 you have thrown the damn ring into mount doom twice. The only difference is that ME1 has actually got an interesting adversary with a personal story(Saren) and an interesting arch nemesis(Sovereign), while ME3 has nobody(no the illusive man isn't interesting and has no personal story and Kai Leng is a misplaced character). Boring side missions and ambush tactics. ME3 basically follows two paths: the central story and side missions. The central story leads to situations which are at least interesting. It is, however, the side missions which are trite. They follow the same pattern almost every time. You enter an area that is clearly set up for multiplayer games, you have to pick up something or activate/deactivate something which will trigger an ambush, which consists of enemies appearing out of thin air and sometimes on top of you. Most of the time you can't setup for defense because they play a movie that takes you and your squad mates out of cover. This pattern of springing ambushes plagues the whole game and is the single most mechanism it uses, even in the main battles. I don't mind ambushes once in a while, but using it in almost every encounter is aggravating. To extend the often brief encounters, they have you look around for upgrades that are spread around over the area and which can't be bought. Imagine five minutes of battle followed by few more minutes of you roaming around to find stuff, then going to the next area doing five minutes of battle and searching that area again. If it wasn't for the need for upgrades, the money, and the experience, I would have skipped these boring missions altogether. What is even worse is that almost every side missions ends with Admiral Hackett telling you that they will send a special team to the place you just liberated or conquered to protect it against further enemy incursions. Exploration dud All three ME have you explore the galaxy. Which sounds great, but in practice are fetch quests of the most annoying kind. In ME 3 it comes down to having to find planets while dodging pursuit and battling fuel shortage to find war assets, credits, and items. There is not feel of exploration. Planets are just presented as a picture with a side story. Unskippable story sequences The game is beset with unskippable movies. Which is okay unless you want to try out classes or have to redo a battle. You can only try a class after having watched ten minutes of babble. Limited Squadmates ME 3 has the gall to offer you only four squadmates to pick from or possibly six depending on how you play out a certain encounter or decided on someone. All the others are from DLC's, temporary or dependent on your save game from ME2. Some DLC's are still not free up to this day! Boring Classes The classes in ME have a few effective powers and so you to do the same thing every time. The only other way of playing is to play a different class, which forces you through ten minutes of unskippable sequences. The ending I don't mind the ending itself, but to force a favorable ending by having you collect all war assets is downright bad, especially when you have to import a savegame from a previous game to have a better chance for a good end. This forces a player to do all the boring side missions and the trite exploration and play through another game. Endings should depend on story choices and, possible, strategic decisions. Kai Leng A special mention of badness is Kai Leng, which is a character dropped into the game from some Asian setting with Katana, who is so obviously scripted not to die and be awesome cool at your expense. You're expense because you are scripted to be stupid when faced with his awesomeness. ME3 is a mediocre game at best and hailing the whole trilogy as superior to Andromeda seems laughable: ME has always been mediocre. so it is no surprise if Andromeda is mediocre too. But then again I haven't played Andromeda so I can't judge. There is much more to tell, but I ran out of space. Re-evaluated in 2017",5,2017-05-31,PC,user

Rev-nok,"Jumping right into here! Story --------- The story in Mass Effect 3 is the ending of a trilogy, and by so there’s a lot lost for those that haven’t played the previous games and I would recommend anyone coming to play the series not to start with the third as it looses a lot of its depth and meaning. However for those that don’t have a save and yet have played the other games, well that’s up to you. I played my first playthrough with a save and liked it, I did it this time without and preferred it over the other. Having played this game twice over, I found myself liking the second time more. Which I give it a lot of credit for. From what I’ve read is that people dislike the shadow sequences of the story, in which I have to disagree. It doesn’t just give a great ending to a trilogy it also shows a side of game you don’t often see, the deep artistic side of storytelling. However, taking the opinions of others into account, I can see where they might be coming from. As the same with watching a movie, you expect a certain type of movie from certain series. The lack of choices in the other as well, good and true. Having only around three large choices, in all of it. One of which turns into three branches. With an over collection of points that don’t actually give you anything at all in the end. Which is regretfully bad. Considering all the points at hand and a strong personal opinion for the artistic I’d give the story a strong 8. Graphics & Animations ---------- Alright, frankly this can always be a bit difficult to come back to. Having played ME:A and games like Witcher 3 and coming back to criticize it can be next to impossible. So instead I am rating the graphics not on how they are but how they aged. The aging of the graphics is done well, there isn’t a point where you feel that this or that is bad. Apart from perhaps some shadow quality, which I ain’t too picky about as well as some outfitting on the stale side characters. The graphics especially the cinematics in the game are astounding and live well up its time, so if you're concerned about graphics holding up, having played to many older games and just haven’t been able to finish them. Perhaps titles such as Deus Ex 1, then you have nothing to fear from ME:3 at this point in time 2017. However the animations in this game are sadly enough.. Stiff, really stiff. You feel like everything is moving a bit too slowly, running and dodging. I don’t personally have any experience with soldier gear or battle suits but wow if I were getting shot at by a giant metal monster from the sky wanting to end all life so to speak, I’d be running twice as fast and throwing myself into cover and not taking a whole five seconds trying to get over a box which is barely knee high. 4/10 Gameplay ---------- Well, what can I say about the gameplay. While there is some position commanding in this game, it frankly falls quite short as the AI aren’t good at all. I felt more than not being the only person on my team that could actually do something, and the AI’s were there to soak up some bullets while I do everything. However that might be a little unfair as the game does give you, companion skills which can also be leveled up and combo used with your own and such can be extremely vital to use in the right time. But all in all, its pretty much luck that it falls into as you move from enemy to enemy, your companions suppose to be protecting your back but for some reason let that one enemy get behind you and kill you with two shots. Companions are strong in this game, though I feel them being slightly more on their own mindset throughout this entire game, however, I have to approve of this. Though it might feel like your second priority it makes a lot of sense that you are at this time and point, while their homeworlds get decimated or their families are lost to them. A certain depth to them, which I personally wanted to see more of and acted out a bit more. Though I can’t imagine many people, would’ve liked that. 4/10. Thankfully they did better. Music & Sound --------------- The music in this game is absolutely brilliant, one of the best track lists I’ve heard. Memorable to the day you finish your first playthrough, tingling nostalgic feeling when you come to it. This team has to commanded, with fitting tracks to fitting cinematics bringing a new level of depth and emotions to the scene. The voice acting in the game is superb, especially from Joker which handles going from joking, to sad to even angry in a truthful way while many of the others do just as well. Giving an applause to all of them. 9/10 Trying to judge this game has been difficult to eye opening and I hope it leaves something to be speculated for the future generations to come. I'd play it again, with a different class.. In the future. 6,25 good enough",6,2017-05-12,PC,user

I am a completionist who spends HOURS on a single play through doing every single thing possible. It took me over 80 hours to beat each Mass Effect game. I only played each game through one time, but I played each game on the hardest difficulty setting possible ( Insanity for ME2 and ME3, and veteran for ME1 because that is the hardest difficulty setting available on your first play through).",10,2017-05-04,PC,user

Colbigdog67,"Just finished the game last night. I am still processing everything so I may come back later and add/edit this. I played ME:A all the way through and then decided to binge-play the trilogy as I never completed it in the past. It was well worth the 2 weeks or so it took me to get through the entire trilogy. Here are my thoughts: This was the first time I actually wept from playing a video game. No other game has tugged on the heart strings like this game and I am not the type to cry over movies and games. The music in 2 & especially 3 is just phenomenal and really works well to bring out the emo's. Yes, there are problems with the game but it's the characters hands-down that make this game great. More than the story, more than the combat (which is pretty fun in 2 &3 ), more than the graphics, it's the relationships that you develop with the characters that are unforgettable. You really do care about them and if/when one if these characters is killed, you feel the loss for real. Regarding romance, it tore me up that I had to choose between 3 women, all of whom I really loved. I had to chose one and it killed me to break the hearts of the other two. This is not a bad thing as it illustrates the emotional impact the game has on you. As for the story, it's difficult to say much about it here without spoilers. Overall, I think BW did a good job with it. Especially in making you feel like things were utterly hopeless at times, going against insurmountable odds. I was disappointed in my own ending the first time through playing it blind. I felt a little cheated by my choice for reasons that I can't really divulge here. After the game ended, I went back through the long ending sequence a few more times selecting the other endings and then spent several more hours researching the endings and their meanings. Combat was kind of ""meh"" in 1 but became fun in 2 and was polished up in 3. I played on normal difficulty as I was more into the game for the story and characters than the fighting but wanted to have some challenge to the fights. Most encounters were pretty easy to get through but there were a few times that I had to work for it. If I replay the series at some point, I'll probably go insane mode. Also, I was vanguard all the way through. There were things about the game that disappointed and frustrated me as well which is why I am not giving it anything higher than an 8. I think the DLC is way too expensive for a 5 year old game. I played the digital deluxe edition with the included DLC and I decided to purchase the Kasumi DLC as I really liked her character but opted not to pay the high price for the other stuff. It should be noted that I watched Christopher Odd play the series along with my own play through, only watching him after I completed the missions first so I was able to experience some of the missing DLC through him. If I decide to replay the series in the future, I may spring for some of the other DLCs but I've already purchased 1 & 2 on Steam back in the day and paid for the Origin annual sub so I feel like EA has gotten enough of my $. In conclusion, whether or not I ever play the series again, it will leave a lasting impact and I will consider the trilogy to be one of my most memorable gaming experiences.",8,2017-04-29,PC,user
eroeru,"I got to play it via the Origin access program, which seems like a good idea, yet falls short in still requiring you to purchase huge DLC-s via a stupid points system. No way to conveniently buy or play the whole package, and 5 years after release the game's still ridiculously overpriced. Plus, it is not featured on Steam or other platforms besides the uncomfy Origin. EA really did make things worse for Bioware (aside ruining the DA franchise). But to come to the game - I actually feel they nailed so much of what was missing in previous games. There's an actual sense of threat and sorrow, and awesome dream scenes that act as a premonition to Shepard's death. It's all rather beautiful. Lots of different consequences to choices. Killing off a former squad mate just because you couldn't explore the system she was on, after which she had been indoctrinated, is pretty impactful (yes, you don't need cutscenes or dramatically done cinematics to make things impactful, sometimes just the opposite works better). Some fans are troubled by the ""bad"" ending and sadness all abound, yet those are same kind of people that love and hate George RR Martin for the red wedding et al. They probably don't distance themselves from story enough, or don't see worth in dealing with hard subjects (a ""turn a blind eye"" kind of folk). I really was rather surprised by the overall quality of the game. It does what it's meant to almost perfectly. A shame EA is shamming customers from money still, with a 5 year old game with new AAA price tagged DLC. A bother.",8,2017-04-25,PC,user

agurczuk,"In short if you've played previous part you'll know exactly what's coming your way. If you have not than there's no real reason to pick it up before playing the previous ones. This is the final chapter in the Sheppard trilogy. The reapers arrive just as you've warned everybody. And yet everyone is surprised. And it's up to you again to save the galaxy. This game definitely feels more linear than the previous. With the reaper imminent danger most of the stories are for you to gather allies for the war. There are just a few missions you could skip but why would you really. The core mechanics are pretty much the same. You fly around the galaxy, land on planets and do missions. The missions consist of you fighting through the ranks of enemies completing different objectives in order to gain allies. Nothing really changed from the previous parts. The combat is very much cover bases - occasional grenades will make you change specific cover but that's about it. The special powers as well as your team mates feel like they're just there but not a real game changer. I think I just got bored with it. Outside of that you'll get a scanner - not really sure if it was available previously - that you can scan your vicinity in order to find artefacts and stuff. But that can alert the reapers so you'll need to evacuate soon or they'll catch you. Pretty annoying mechanic - luckily one that you don't and probably will not use during the game. The one other change is that you're presented with a war room where you can observe the allied power you have recruited. However this part confused me and apart from looking at single bar - indicating probably when you get enough allies for final mission - it's pretty much useless as well. Visually it might be a bit better than previous instalments however the animations are quite wonky, especially the running animation - this was even more visible since last game before this I played was Metal Gear Solid V which had superb animations. The ending - the most commonly criticized part - is not as bad as I've anticipated, but not good as well. It's just meh. Overall there were cool moments but the game didn't capture me. I'm glad I've played it but I don't expect ever coming back to it.",6,2017-04-21,PC,user
LifeHistory,All in all a very enjoyable game. Its a gears of war in a mass effect shell. There is almost no RPG elements in this game and by the end nothing that you did in the two amazing ME games before did matter. The game was very rushed when it could have been fantastic if only they gave it more time. The action in this game made it fun to play and am not kidding when I say it felt like I was playing Gears of war. This was as big of a disappointment as Dead Space 3. EA lost it soul by the time they released DS3 and ME3 they never came back from that fail. Ever since they kept releasing pure **** games.,8,2017-04-20,PC,user

albasile,"The final story of the Mass Effect Trilogy delivers on the long anticipated main villains that were pulling the strings from the last two games. The lore and conspiracies that surrounded these puppet masters are now gone, with the long awaited arrival and mass invasion of the Reapers. It's very clear that this is a fight for the survival of the galaxy with an ""us vs. them"" mentality that puts Commander Shepard in the heart of an all-out galactic war with the Reapers. Game play, the graphics and soundtrack are all top notch. The combat mechanics have under gone more improvements from the cover based system of its predecessor. Combat is much quicker and more accurate with a new grab melee attack system, the ability to sprint without fatigue, and a dodge roll capability that all help make combat more fluid in ME3. Mass Effect has always been about the characters, conversation, story, and exploration with the characters being ME3’s strongest attribute. Most of your previous characters return just as fleshed out as they were with the second game. There are a couple of newbies: James Vega, and another (Spoiler) who both have interesting personalities and backstories but their characters suffer only from being introduced so late in the series. There are no loyalty missions, so most of the bonding Shepard has with his/her squad mates have already been established by their history together. The story although an improvement on ME2's, still has its plot holes. (Examples: Kai Leng, and ME3's ending of course). The Plot of the story is good and it immerses the player for much of the game until the last 40-60 minutes of the story with the plot faltering completely by the game’s conclusion. One of ME3’s biggest drawbacks is the stripping down of the ME conversation abilities that Shepard has had in previous games. Conversations have been deprived to just two choices for much of the game with many conversations taking place without any player interaction. This leaves the player with less involvement in making decisions and it streamlines responses of other characters or events. Exploration has been completely gutted from ME3. It’s understandably so giving that there is a full scale galactic war going on, but it is something that is noticeably lacking given that it has always been part of ME’s formula. Lastly, ME3’s ending is one of the biggest misfires ever seen in a story’s ending with an incoherent plot, its inability to tie up loose ends, and give a satisfying and logical conclusion. The ending leaves much to be desired and it puts a huge black mark on an otherwise well-made and emotional story. In short, the ending is terrible. Mass Effect 3 had the potential to surpass even the original ME had the conversation ability been intact, less plot holes in the story, and had a good conclusion; ME3 could have easily been the best of the trilogy, but instead it's the weakest. Even with its setbacks, ME3 is still a good solid game 8/10",8,2017-03-29,PC,user
GamesBeatAll,"Okay yeah, character customisation is utter pants, some of the animations are bad, like the NCP drinking from a bottle he stuck in his eye, and another one who appears to have some horrendous body wide tic. But I can live with that. But the two things that disappoint me are the plot - or lack of it, and the dumbing down. Don't bother bringing your brain to this ME party - you won't be needing it. All the basic good stuff from ME is there, and some improvements. And yeah, I probably will play it to the bitter end, but no, I won't be pre-ordering ME 5 if there is one. The dialogues, OMG, who wrote this snooze fest? And padded out with soooo many repetitive and pointless conversations. And the basic premise, finding new homes - there is no urgency, nor strong motivation of 'all of mankind will die if you don't sort this Ryder'. It's more like an adventure holiday where you repeat the same adventures, just in a different location. Also, I don't feel my answers and decisions really make any difference, where are the massive moral dilemmas? Where are the REAL character choices? The technical issues are, well technical issues. What I'm finding hard to forgive is the lack of heart, the heart of the ME franchise, an immersive story with well designed characters.",6,2017-03-26,PC,user

pinkytwist,"[Some mild spoilers about the ending.] I understand why this game is not that popular among some of the fans, specially if you played it before all the DLC came out. Personally, I only experienced the Mass Effect games recently so maybe I had a better first impression on the trilogy, specially ME3, because the DLC really added a lot to that game. I think people who were expecting a different ending allowed their whole experience be ruined when they didn't get what they wanted. I did feel really depressed when I finished ME3, but not because I thought the ending was bad. I actually liked that there is basically no perfect ending. Every choice has pros and cons and it's up to you to choose which one you think fits your Shepard best. I think this was why this game got so much hate, people got so resentful that even though the game as a whole is just as good as all the other ME games, they still rate it as a 0 just because the ending wasn't all sunshine and butterflies. Talk about being bitter. I've grown attached to my female Shepard and she is probably my favorite protagonist of all time now. Did I want her to happily ride off into the sunset with all squad members? Of course. But considering the scale of the story and the reapers as a villain, I think it would be unlikely and illogical to have that perfect ending. I think I wouldn't get as emotional as I did when those credits rolled. Overall, really good game and a perfect close to the trilogy and to Commander Shepard's story. ME3 only made my love for these characters grow even more, specially those who were with Shepard since game 1. It's really amazing to see how far they have come and how strong their relationship has become over the course of the trilogy. I'm going to miss them. I can always go back and replay it all, but it will never be the same thing as experiencing it for the very first time. I envy the people who will get to have that chance.",8,2017-03-22,PC,user

The game has changed, and now it's more action than RPG. And this is disturbing. Dialogues are simpler and less interesting than Shepard. The reapers are already on Earth and we must destroy them once and for all. Epic! But the game felt so epic as we would like. I became more bored. In the story we combine race. Interesting jobs became less and more boring shooting. The combat system is even more improved, but we are forced to shoot very much. New characters boring, and the old friends and familiar, but still more sad. Although one scene with Garrus is very touching. The plot is full of intrigue. Everything is simple and straightforward.

sft,"Still not quite the full kilo I have a somewhat ambivalent relationship with the Mass Effect games. I’ve enjoyed all of them but that enjoyment has been tempered by frustration, mostly with the combat mechanics. MASS EFFECT 3 is no exception to this rule. The cover mechanics in ME2 were an improvement over those in the original game but in ME3 they have messed them up. For some crazy reason they’ve bound 3 vital actions (cover, roll, and storm (sprint)) to a single key (I believe this may also have been the case with ME2 but I don’t recall it being so annoying). This is a monumentally stupid design choice. (Now that I’ve finished the game I discover that there is a work around for the PC version – if only I’d looked earlier.) And yet, despite this, I still had fun battling the Reapers and their cronies. Aside from this the RPG elements seem to have been played down a little and there’s an option to water them down even more, so that it plays as more of an action game (I didn’t try this option, so I don’t know exactly how different the experience is). Personally, I don’t see the point in this as this is where the Mass Effect games score highly – in the RPG elements. It’s the characters, the strong story, and the detailed universe that draw you in, and make you become invested in the outcome for all concerned. And ME3 is very effective in all these areas. As always there’s lots of background information to absorb as well, if you choose to do so. The graphics are reasonable for a 2012 game (although they don’t stand out as exceptional in any way) and the voice acting is good for the most part. Overall ME3 is a worthy addition to the franchise (I won’t get into the debate regarding the ending, as this is not the ideal platform) and I look forward to Mass Effect: Andromeda.",8,2017-02-26,PC,user
Pendra,"Great storytelling and a breath taking finale offsets the gameplay shortcomings. The gameplay has more RPG elements than ME2 but still not as good as in ME1. The weapon upgrades and mods are nice. Unfortunately, all but 1-2 maps were dumbed down to rail shooter territory. The quest system is a little bit of a setback compared to ME1-2. The less handholding is nice but it is hard to tell if the mission is even completable at that point of the game. Some stuff is way too vague and gives no hint. This leaves their completion up to dumb luck. The discussion options are dumbed down to the point of being eliminated completely in some casual conversations. This usually leaves a Paragon option and a Renegade option without middle ground. Finally, some conversation option results completely out of character continuation. While many criticize the ending, I found them fantastic (extended cut). No cleat good or bad. From a moral point of view, all can be supported and dismissed. They are almost in philosophical heights. It is also very bold. Not your usual ""happily ever after"" fluff. It delivers proper dramatic writing. Without the endings, the game would be 5-6. With that 15-16. The only reason I can't give 10 is the handling of DLC. It is, hm, poor and even insulting.",9,2017-01-21,PC,user

Ninja_Se7eN,"Disclaimer: I've played the first and second Mass Effects with all of the story DLCs and played 55 hours of Mass Effect 3 clearing the story and all story related DLC. RPGs are one of my favourite genres. Intro: On Mass Effect 3 we once again take the role of Commander Shepard tasked yet again to save the universe from a threat we've been warning them about for the past 3 years and almost everyone chose to ignore the warnings. What I liked: - The story - it's a good story except for the ending, more on that later. - Decisions that I made on ME1 and ME2 impacted how the story developed in ME3. - Minor improvements to the TPS mechanics. - I just had a single crash during my 55h of gameplay. This was a great improvement over ME2 where it crashed a lot! What I didn't like: - The ending - this is a really bad ending, on a series based upon choice and consequences and after ME2's ending being based upon on decisions of the entire game this ending just doesn't fit the game. Basically every choice you ever made is thrown out of the window and you get to choose between 4 default endings. Worse than that, none of the endings fitted my playstyle because I was the ultimate paragon, my Shepard made peace everywhere and saved everyone and there's not a single ending good enough for the good I've been doing to the Mass Effect universe. - No menu hotkeys: a hotkey for the journal and squad menus were much appreciated in the first Mass Effect. Why aren't they in the second game? Why isn't there any way to add them? - Graphics seem somehow worse than Mass Effect 2. This may be because the Alliance's colour theme is darker but overall I got some weird shadows and graphical glitches. Conclusion: This game is good if you completely ignore the ending. I really enjoyed closing the sub-plots of the different alien species in the universe and I absolutely loved the climax of my romance with Liara. The ending just ruins what was a great experience until then.",8,2016-03-26,PC,user

Sirik_Matak,"Mass Effect 3 is a schizohprenic conclusion of the serie's contradiction. The Mass Effect, seeing it in its full spectrum, seems to go in two separate ways - backwards and forward at the same time. While the gameplay part of the series was progressing into more and more competent pop-a-mole TPS, reaching a strong mediocrity with moderate speed of the fights and a better encounters' design; the storytelling and writing departments were slipping into the pit of awfulness of tumblr level of quality. No, really. I hope you didn't cringe too much at the ""persuasion"" of Saren in the first game, because Mass Effect 3 is really thousand times worse. It's so bad, that they even copy-pasted the said scene with the Illusive Man. There are still some average bits that can be counted in favor, like solving the Genophage and uniting the Geth with their old folks - in fact they feel like they were written by absolutely different people that wrote the major parts of the main quest - like the wunderwaffe, a living Protean or the Reapers invasion itself, not to mention the ending. I think it's enough to said that they efficiently turned the Reapers from vague masterminds of unknown, through the ""I will get you next time Gadget!"" cartoony villains, into space dragons with their own zombie hordes. What I'm saying is that the premise that was present in the first game, a premise for fantasy space-opera with s-f paint all over it was lost in favor of generic high-fantasy shlock where tumblrian fan-service was more important than its integrity itself. Enough said that the first two games are absolutely irrelevant after the first minute of the third game, since apparently all the Reapers needed were 5 years to reach the galaxy and take it in a matter of weeks. Sovereign and Harbringer are pretty dumb, if they tried to pull some more elaborate schemes (it's a fan-fic level of quality I've mentioned earlier) that were equally pointless and stupid. Why to activate the Citadel and uncover yourself in trying to do so, if in other case you need and extra 5 years to reach all of the Galaxy? Why to collect people to ""build"" a Reaper (there's some cartoon science right there) and then when you finally have material, time and safety to do so (after the invasion) to abandon the idea all together and just sit there doing nothing? Do you know what's the biggest irony here? That despite the absolutely garbage writing with some cherries among it, I enjoyed the third game the most of the three, The pop-a-mole part keeps you involved enough to finish the game, assuming you start on the Insane difficulty (anything less is pointless). It's the worst game overall, because the ratio of good vs bad is off the chart, unlikely to the first Mass Effect, that is sitting in one circle of mediocrity altogether. You can see that there was little thought and work put into the technical side of the game. The texture quality was really sub-par, voice acting is just terrible (accompanied by awfully written lines it gives a really bad outcime) and don't even let me start to talk about animations.",4,2016-01-22,PC,user

NEVER play the game to completion without the extended ending and even then you will probably just choose to make up an ending for it.

If you decided to play the entire series you will wish this game never existed due to the ending they gave us. The ending however is not the sole reason a game should be scored however it did kill my 10/10 down to a 7/10.

ME2 had better game-play and amazing voice acting. Both games filled me with suspense and trepidation concerning the Reapers and the all out battle to come. ME3 did not deliver for this all out, be all- end all battle with the Sentient machines. The ending(s) were the biggest letdown I have ever experienced. My recommendation: Do not get this game. For all of the hype, the writing was appalling, thanks to the lead writer Mac Walters. The entire mood of the game, the characters and interactions, even the ending was nothing but pathetic doom and gloom. There is no ""win"", merely completion of the game (which has absolutely zero replay value). What could have been the best game in history turned out to be a massive let down that leaves you wondering if you messed something up to get such a disgraceful ending. BioWare has lost the spark. Sadly, the talent that made wonderful and fun games have all left. While the visual artists did a good job (with the exception of 8-bit running models and worse graphics than ME2) the stories that brought us joy and fun and the feeling of fresh and new worlds are simply not there in ME3. The overall arc/plot of this game is horrendous - clearly indicating a lack of skill and / or talent from the writing leads.",0,2015-10-16,PC,user
Thylbanus,"Now that I have been able to actually play it, I thought I'd post about the actual game. I'm not going to go into any spoilers, but I will address some of the furor about the game in the end. First off, the gameplay is probably the worst in the series. Control is a mess. A single control is used for running, ducking into cover, mantling, and using. Nothing is worse than running down a hallway to put some distance between you and an opponent and get caught near a wall or ledge and duck into cover, or having to stop to use an interactable object. Simply stupid. There still is no jump option, but a double click of the said ""universal"" button will cause you to make a dive roll. While melee attacks make an appearance, it's totally useless with the ""universal"" button, except in surprise. Missions finally received a notification on the map, but only the important ones. Hell, you have to actually keep track of side quests on your own. You woun't know if you completed a sidequest until you try to go back and do it again. There is no notification that you have what you need and are allowed to turn it in. Some of these are actually worth turning in for the assets they provide. Inventory is even more opaque than ME2. While they did have a comparison guide that showed the difference between your equipped item and an observed item, it's done in bars and not numbers. Call me simple, but I prefer numbers to bar graphs. This is where ease of information ends. Once you have a certain brand of weapon, you can then purchase the next in the series (I, II, III, IV, V), but all it says is that it improves the item. Doesn't give any specifics on what is improved, or give comparisons to justify the cost. WHEN you find the weapon makes no difference in it's ability. The crappiest shotgun in the game isn't found until late the second act and it costs more than the better selections to upgrade. So price does not equal benefit. Level design is questionable, at best. Some is just downright mindboggling. It's like the level designers had no idea how the mechanics of the game would function. Few are designed reasonably well, good flow and logical objectives with just enough variety to allow for varied gameplay. Most of the time, run and gun is simply the best option. After a while, you get locked into the mindset of run and gun when they try to force you into a different mindset and you have to die before realising that you needed to go easy this time. There was simply more bad than good here. Saying that the difficulty was cranked up is a like saying 1.01 is technically greater than 1. For all the complaints about the ending, it's not really a surprise that it ends the way it does. This game promised unprecedented agency, but realistically speaking couldn't deliver within the formats it was targeting. The ending, viewed through a lense of time and complaints past, really highlights that it was a big furor for all the wrong reasons. The ending was completely viable as an ending. An anticlimactic ending. The omissions in narrative aside, the whole story was well done. This is about the only thing that was. The rest of the game is what was messed up. This whole climactic build up that was pretty much spent in a cutscene. A cutscene that is the same in every way, no matter what the play though. No, I'm not talking about the red/green/blue ending, but the assault on Earth. All the running around you did meant nothing to the game other that what color ending you got. There is no pitched battle for Earth. I honestly expected some movement around the globe to take back strongholds and then finally attack the the main objective. Nope, just a final board upon landing. The moments of fighting among the your various rallied troops is but a passing nod to what you did. The real loss of the illusion of agency wasn't the ending, it's everything that built up to it. None of it mattered. If you rallied factions A, B, C, E, and G and lost D and F. No biggie. Didn't cost you anything, but MAYBE a missing person to talk to. Hell, one faction is pretty much completely missing even if you had not done any of the others. Maybe if each faction was tasked with taking back a part of Earth and was as long as the final objective and the final objective was twice as long, it might have felt like an accomplishment. As it is, the final level is noticeably short and plainly evident that what you did meant nothing. I never once thought to myself, ""I'm sure glad I have faction X at my side in this fight!"" Doesn't matter. That is the real problem. TL:DR - Story good. Gameplay bad. EA failed to deliver in gameplay what the excellent narrative provided. Shame.",4,2015-09-23,PC,user

Redwarrior1up,"I really REALLY wanted to love this game, I've been a long time fan of the series. I will say this game expanded upon the high points of the series like combat, the great lore and story behind the universe. However after almost $200 dollars into the series and a number of playthroughs I find the 3rd installment to be a mockery of the actual idea behind the game itself. I also hate to rehash the same things everyone else says but the ending was terrible, I would've liked more after all the time invested in the story, my choices to mean more than a choice between three colors of fireworks. I would also point out before the first game came out a much more compelling story was planned but somehow leaked onto the internet and was exchanged for the story we have now.",3,2015-09-11,PC,user

whatever523,"I waited a long time to play this game, mainly because of Origin and the low ratings. I was right about Origin, but wrong about the ratings. Mass Effect 3 is a great addition to the ME series. + Story: Like the previous ME games, ME3 also has a great story. The final two hours are almost like a movie. Yes, I would have made the ending different, too, but honestly, it's not THAT bad and giving less than a 7 or 8 rating because of it is ridiculous. I played the extended version. + Characters: The series has always had some of the best and most believable characters and it hasn't changed. + The game has moved the series forward technically by a lot. Movement, shooting, the interface - it all looks and feels much better. + The presentation (graphics, sound, cutscenes, videos) is fantastic. + Your choices from the previous games are all saved and there are many new ones to make. + Lots of customizable weapons and armors. + Good NG+ implementation. - DLCs. Just stop this **** When I pay for a game, I want all of it. - Origin: Origin is useless crapware, like Uplay. Always online ****. Let me play the single player without internet. I will never pay the full price for Origin games, but rather wait until they're for sale. - The ending: It was delivered flawlessly, but there are definitely some things about it that don't make a lot of sense. In the end Mass Effect 3 is an outstanding game that provides dozens of hours of entertainment with a somewhat controversial ending.",9,2015-09-08,PC,user

HarryXie,"Mass Effect 3 is not the best game in the series, but it's definitely a good one. Left alone the whole ending controversy, the game is excellent. Choices, especially the one between the Geth and the Quarians, are still pretty difficult and intriguing. A much larger variety of guns are brought into the game, and they give the game a sense of progress. The combat is fast and exciting, though sometimes in some side missions it can get repetitive. Mass Effect 3 also has the atmosphere of apocalypse that Mass Effect 1 and 2 don't. The desperation and struggle of the whole universe can be easily felt. The ending, after the Extended Cut, is okay. It's still a lot worse than the epic battle in Mass Effect 2, but it does make some sense and gives us a final conclusion about Shepard and the whole Reaper mystery. Overall, it's a finale that doesn't reach the level of Mass Effect 2 but still pretty satisfying and powerful.",9,2015-08-06,PC,user

Many critiques expected that in the end they will be perceived as heros and everything will be ""resolved"". The ending was nothing like that and I loved it about the game. It is acceptable for movies to end like this, but not for a game?

ApolloDown,"There is no way to review this game fairly. So much is so good about it, and so much is so terrible about it. I will do a pros and cons list as I think that's the only way to really get an idea for what you are getting into. Before I do, let me state for the record that Mass Effect 2 was and still is my favorite game of all time. Let me also give you some advice - if you are playing this for the first time, use the MEHEM mod. It is the only way to salvage the ending. Either that or let Marauder Shields cut you down and never watch the actual ending. You'll know when it happens. PROS Excellent art Excellent combat Excellent dialogue Excellent DLC Great moments in the story. Legion on Rannoch always makes me tear up. Same with Mordin on Tuchanka. Great dialogue. Drunk Tali FTW. Marauder Shields. CONS The ending. The extended cut does nothing to address the problems. Anybody who thinks it does is simply not paying attention. Cut corners(femshep running out of combat animations are a good example) Kai Leng. Why am I afraid of a dude with a sword when I literally have a computer sword on my arm and/or space magic and guns? Horrible dialogue. See Kai Leng. See also James Vega. See also Miranda. See also Jacob. Again. Blatant cash grab(you win! Buy DLC!) Star Baby. The Illusive Man going from excellent bad guy with believable motivations to total moron absentee landlord. Streamlined combat. I miss the Blue Suns. I miss getting hit with biotics. Kai Leng again. Lack of character differentiation in cut scenes(I'm a biotic, why am I always(or ever) pulling a pistol? And why is my pistol always the crappy one I NEVER use?) Bullet sponges are not a good gameplay mechanic. Ever. Banshees could have been so much scarier. They ultimately just bore and/or infuriate me. The ending(guys, the ending is AWFUL. There is a reason for the terrible reviews) Lack of choice(5 or 6 real choices, everything else just goes the same) Lack of consequences(see also lack of choices) Female characters that look like they were based off a 13 year old's fantasies(See EDI cameltoe, See also Liara boobs, see also Ashley default outfit) Killing characters that I worked to keep alive HARD in ME2 offscreen is a sin(sorry Kelly) Planet scanning is not a side quest. No variety in hub worlds, just the citadel. I want my Illium back. Kai Leng again(Bioware, I get that you wanted a cool villain. But the **** to scary ratio is too high, partly because he's not scary(see swords don't scare my space gun wielding badass) and partly because he is full ****) Star Baby again. Dat ending. Do I play Mass Effect 3 multiple times? Yes. Do I always feel cheated each time? Yes. But I always end up playing it again. Bioware and EA, somehow you have found a way to give me disappointment on demand. I pre ordered this game, and this game has guaranteed I will never pre order a game again. Continue doing business this way and you will not stay in business. This game has very much earned its user score. On a side note, you can very clearly see what is wrong with game journalism today by comparing the user score to the curated score. This game made me stop looking at journalist reviews, period. You have proven that you cannot be trusted to be honest.",6,2015-07-13,PC,user
Efferkongen,"I am a HUGE Mass Effect fan, and I got so say that the third is the best. It's combat system has been improved a lot, it's amount of dialogues are numerous, it's humor is great, and it's story awesome! However, a few mentions about it's flaws: It's a shame that it doesn't give you the chance to involve any of your previous party members from the second game. Even if some of them has good reasons, it should still be an option to include them, and take the consequences of them joining you. The ending which a lot of people are mad about are worth mentioning as well. I personally love the explanation of why the reapers do the cycles, it makes sense, especially from a machines cold couculations. However, what disappointed me the most, what the unresolved matter with the Illusive man. Everything in 2 and 3 points to that he has a plan with the reapers that could be useful and effective, but morally screwed, but he is just indoctrinated for no reason, which is a huge letdown for me. Those are the two main reasons that I don't give this game a 10/10, because it just remove some of the best things in Mass Effect that could have made it completely epic.",9,2015-07-07,PC,user

inkblowout,"After reading some of these comments... how can some people give this a rating of 0 because of the ending? So 20 minutes of gameplay out of 24-30 hours of gameplay is a good reason to give this a 0, 1, or even a 2. I know some have given good explanations for their ratings but some are just biased to read. The fact is. I had fun throughout this entry of mass effect, it is weaker than the other 2 but it was a hell of a ride for me. The problems I had from this game though were 3 things. Lack of character interaction, mission and side missions and the ending. So lack of character interaction really bothered me because in mass effect 1 or 2. You could be able to talk with your squad after every mission and you could talk about them, you would talk about their family, their personal lives and etc. and you could choose to what to say. But what mass effect 3 really does is that they give these one directional liners which does talk about what's going on with the mission. But it takes away your ability to choose conversation options which is a real letdown in my opinion. 2nd complaint is the missions and side missions. Although the priority missions make sense to the story. The side missions and journals fell like a chore to gain war assets so that you can thrive for that ""prefect ending"". Unlike journal/side missions in mass effect 1-2. They would either consist of exploration, fighting baddies and etc. But mass effect 3. Most journal missions are achievable by scanning which is also a let down. And lastly the ending is the biggest problem to the series. Ya sure the ending **** but it is difficult to end off a kickass trilogy. (I couldn't even think of any better endings as well.) I don't know why this ending was made. The 3 choices are stupid and dumb if you think about it. It should have been. Activate the crisable and let it do it's job. There shouldn't have been those 3 endings. It felt like bioware was going toward the deus ex style of ending but failed. And the extended cut doesn't help at all... it just explains stuff in detail but doesn't change the initial ending. Starchild was also a nuisance as well... ever since I went up in that elevator and saw starchild, I knew the ending was bad. But honestly overall, I had a great time playing this game, the game's combat was entertaining and there was so much stuff that made the game so memorable. Bioware did let me down in a way... but I was happy I played this game. I had the chance to not to buy this game despite reading the hate reviews on this game.

If after having a field day at an amusement park end with some guy throwing up on you, you consider it to be the ""worst day ever"" you didn't deserve to go, and that's what the ME franchise has been. ME1 was great, had it's hiccups but where it shined was the sense of scale, it's combat fell short. It was fine but we needed more. ME2 was great in characters, you felt more for your squad then you ever did before, in return you lost alot of that scale, but still great. ME3 took from both and ended with something almost spectacular. Felt bigger than 2 but not as big as 1, characters were almost as good as 2 way better than 1, and it's combat blew 'em both outta the water. That ending though.",9,2015-06-19,PC,user

smeeeee,"Behold Mass Effect 3, a victim of greed, the ""good enough"" approach, and America's corporate devil assuming direct control (yay puns) of an innocent Canadian developer. Mass Effect 3 had the potential of being a masterpiece, and even showed signs of it- BioWare improved the combat system, adding new guns, keeping the epic old ones (Mattock FTW!!!), and adding heavy melee, combat rolls, and instant kills from cover. The graphics are truly stunning, the new enemies are challenging and sometimes can scare your socks off, and BioWare brought back the awesome characters from previous games- Garrus, Grunt, or anyone you didn't kill. But what mainly brought the game down was the all-too famous ending (or endings). Even with the Extended Cut DLC (which is a cheap way to squeeze even more $$$$$ out of you, it only adds a few lines to the ""ending""), it's basically like a magician saying, ""Pick a card! Any card!"" It's basically just choosing between A, B, and C (and D with EC). The worst part: It's littered with plot holes. For the sake of those who haven't played it yet, I won't say too much about the ending, but I can assure you, it's one of the worst endings in video game history. What also brought the game down was the INSANE amount of DLCs. There's literally like 14 DLCs! It's crazy! Why on Earth must someone pay more for a game that's already theirs?! Also, characters like Jack, Miranda, Kelly, and Jacob were like completely left to hang and dry. In the end, Mass Effect may be addicting for its sweet game-play, and interesting characters, but the rest of the game just sends you away empty. So yeah. EA Mass ef*cked Mass Effect 3.

praXis,"People heavily criticize this game for its ending, but I found it to be fairly consistent with the rest of this sequel's content - contradictory, confused, cliche, and just horribly written. It's painfully obvious that Bioware lost some valuable people in all departments after ME2, and that while Mac Walters did a decent job as a character writer in the past, a lead writing position is beyond his current abilities. I mean, Mass Effect never had Pulitzer-winning content but when all the fun and well-established character is **** out of a series by genuinely BAD dialogue and truly ridiculous story elements, it's a damn shame. Positives? Great combat, some epic setpieces (squandered unfortunately), and a sense of closure. The guns feel and sound better than ever. Quickly dodging from cover to cover, or launching quickly over barriers with a double-tap of the spacebar is great. The quality and variety of new enemies is very good. The multiplayer is ACTUALLY FUN - though not too varied. The maps are good, though rarely memorable. Most cutscenes are impressive. The new character of Javik is great. The fact that you only get him with the From Ashes DLC is RIDICULOUS. Should be included with the base game as he adds a significant amount of context and depth to the story. Negatives? Terrible new characters: James Vega - bodybuilding Jersey Shore dudebro, Diana Allers - pointless embedded journalist in a little rubber dress, Kai Leng - evil space ninja (not kidding). WTF Bioware. Maybe these characters are supposed to somehow be canon, but were just introduced and utilized poorly - my point that they are terrible in this game still stands. The faces of many of the characters have been changed from ME2, and simply look bad. Joker comes to mind right away. What the hell is going on with his mouth? This is an inexplicable step back from the models and animations in ME2. Model glitching and bad camera during dialogue. (You'd think they'd have figured this out by now.) Painfully bad and cliche dialogue with terrible pacing. Mac Walters loves cheesey Hollywood military action movies, apparently. He's about as good at re-creating their content as a 14-year-old boy though. Doesn't stop him from trying. Moral choices seem tacked-on and weird, but that's probably just the writing. Disappointingly dumbed-down inventory and leveling for the sake of console kiddies. Not much RPG left, but that could be said for ME2 as well, I guess. More overpriced DLC horsecrap. We hate you for good reason, EA. You should figure out a way to monetize that. ME1 is one of my favourite games of all time - even with its blemishes.

Guinness,"Considering more new updates on the ME4 lately, I thought that it may be useful to do renewed review of ME3 for anyone who is still uncertain about it. I will not review the game as out of box Vanila which came out in 2012, but rather as combined experience of main game, its DLCs and vast variety of fan created mods which in my experience in large enhance the play. First, to address the area of ending. I do too agree that even after you install the “extended” cut option, the final choice is just somewhat less vague but as equally depressing. In my experience, the most optimistic ending I achieved was the one in which a glimpse of what resemble Sheppard’s body comes to life. Although satisfying in the sense that Cmdr. Sheppard could still be alive, it simply does not merge with the previous events which led Sheppard to the final scene. For me even worse than the ending, was the increasingly negative mood throughout the entire game. Even the few happy moments which existed, simply felt out of place. This is not understanding for me, considering Shepard’s character is successfully completing series of events, which in turn increasingly enabling huge alliance of interstellar nations to fight the invaders. That realistically would lead to more optimistic mood with characters and story, regardless of the final outcome. Few words about mods, which at this time are widely available and very successful in improving the visuals in the game. As it is known, the vanilla version of the ME3 was very disappointing, featuring low resolution textures, and rather bad environmental appearance. Even the Sheppard appearance never matched your character appearance form M1 and 2. With series of texture updates, and with help of FX lighting mods, the game really gets vibrant. I would say the mods are must to ensure the full immersion. In terms of game and story contents, I think it exceed the experience from ME2, even without the DLC. If DLCs are installed, some additional time gain is achieved, but not necessary better experience. At least in case of Omega which is simply just a shooting spree. Lavithian is somewhat special, in respect that it does offer more story, but it is very short. In case of Citadel, Bioware went step up and actually developed descent side task with much needed fun aspects of the game. In fact, had I have a chance to play Citadel when I first played ME3, I would stop the game right there and not even venture into the final cut. Overall, once properly moded, and with addition of DLCs, I found the game likable, regardless of the weak story and final outcome. It is a story shooter, but it can still be immersive, and it is not all running through objectives. There are definitely aspects of RPG in the game, they are just not as prominent. I have logged over 120hrs with just one play-through, including main game and all DLCs, which is more than I expected.",8,2015-02-18,PC,user
Munkey,"Mass Effect 3 is a disappointing ending to the series. Mostly combat based, lacking in good story telling and less dialogue options then in previous titles. From the start you feel that something is wrong. The change of lead writter for the third game was a mistake. NPC characters are still good but there is not that much interaction then in ME and ME2. The day one DLC NPC was a big mistake also. The DLC character Javik being the last of the Protheans is vital to the story but you make him a DLC. You see the money hand of EA in this game. The ending is so disappointing even the extended cut didn't make it better. Game is solid mechaniclly and combat is fluid but the story and more combat focused character of the game and lackluster ending make a weak game. For me 5 out of 10. EA why...",5,2015-02-16,PC,user

therob91,"This should have been(and nearly is) the greatest story/character driven RPG of all time, but Bioware made a MAJOR mistake with the final title. This game is absolutely incredible until you hit the last 10 minutes. Honestly maybe even the last 5 minutes, because the story was ramped up and paced so perfectly that the lead up RIGHT UNTIL the ending is once in a generation exceptional. Then you get to the ending and I don't know if they ran out of money or what, but it completely falls flat and ignores all of the style of the series. It changes from a game about choices building up and coming together to create an epic finale (across 6ish years for people that played the games when they came out) into a 3 pronged choice that ignores every choice made in any of the 3 games and, in a game HEAVILY influenced by film(to the point of having a grain filter naturally active to appear more like a movie) has a final few moments that feel more at home in an ending to a fighting game characters story or even something like a shmup. I'm torn on what to give this game. Its clearly a 10/10 until the ending, but this game is ABOUT the story, A weak ending in TES or Fallout isn't that big a deal because they are different style games. This game is about story and characters and the main concept of the game is basically thrown out the window in the final moment. All I can end up deciding is that the ending SEVERELY impacted my feelings about the entire franchise, and the score needs to reflect that.",5,2015-01-30,PC,user

marc5477,"Preface: I played the original game without any DLC. For the most part, the game feels like Mass Effect 2. Combat is basically the same and RPG elements are still reduced to minimal. It really does play more like a shooter or adventure game than an RPG. Loot is still minimal and customization is basically non-existent aside from choosing from a very limited number of weapons and armor, many of which were very similar to each other. There is never a feeling of progression that is associated with RPG's but for what its worth, combat was actually fun in the same way that shooters are fun. Many things annoyed me in this game aside from not going back to its ME1 RPG roots. The biggest is the planet exploration... if we can even call it that. Orbit a planet, click a button and thats is all there is to it. Very silly and reminded me of playing ET on the Atari. The only challenge to it is to escape from the flying Reapers which was entirely trivial and mind numbingly boring. I liked how they tried to make every mission have an impact on the ending of the game. The more you complete the better your odds of getting a better ending. Unfortunately they completely dropped the ball on the impact of the score on the story as all the endings were pretty much the same regardless of score. I also hated the fact that you cannot get the best ending without playing multiplayer. I do not want to play with others in a 1 player game. Yet I could not get my readiness high enough to get the best ending. Besides, by the time I reached the end, I was so bored of the game I just wanted to end it not play more with people I never met. Next, I thought the ending was rushed. As it turns out, much of what you do in the game was not necessary because the endings would be about the same if you rushed through the game anyway. You are always presented with the same options and there is very little difference between the high readiness endings and the minimal endings. It felt like I wasted my time running around finishing missions especially since there was minimal RPG progression. I dont think the endings are terrible, but they were definitely not as exciting as I would have expected them to be given it was a trilogy. Last, there is only 1 real boss battle in the entire game and it was too easy. Most of the other battle finales were not really bosses but rather assignments like painting a target or surviving a few minutes. There were no imposing battles at any point in the game and I never felt like I was in danger. There were a few battles that were cheap since you did not know where the enemies were coming from but after you saw it once it became trivial. Which brings me to annoyance, there is no mini map. If you want to see the map you have to bring it up manually and it still did not show enemy position thus taking away any form of strategy you might want to employ. its kind of ironic that there was no mini map but you could always see your mission objective target painted clearly without the map. I ran into two game breaking bugs that could have ended my games early (and neither were ever fixed). One was on the deck of the ship. Shepard simply gets stuck near Joker and cannot move no matter what you do. This bug can happen any time in the game. It is a well known bug and has not been fixed. The only way to work around it is through loading a previous save and making sure to save before entering the area. If you quick-saved while stuck hoping a reload would fix the issue, then you can really mess up your game because you will load into the game stuck. The only other solution is to get a 3rd party save game editor where you have to manually edit your save and change your save position. The other game breaking crash happened while on a mission. At some point, as you progressed, you walk through a door and the game simply crashes every time. This is also a common bug and has not been fixed. Luckily there was a work around. You have to inch through the door and continuously quick save until the game crashes. If you quick saved inside the room, you will be able to load the new save inside the room and the crash will stop. Still, its unbelievable that this has not been fixed. Overall, the game was not great. It lacked any innovation compared to parts 1 and 2 and felt rushed when you account for the game breaking bugs, lazy endings, lack of exciting fights/bosses, and weak story tie ins. Essentially, all your decisions ultimately did not matter very much from previous games, and much of what you do in ME3 is pointless since the ending are all very similar. Its not a horrible game but it was definitely boring after the 1st hour due to lack of RPG progression and lack of gameplay-story impact. I do not recommend this game if you are looking for an RPG. If you are a heavy FPS fan I would give this a 6/10 instead of a 4/10.",4,2015-01-15,PC,user
Ghost67,"Mass Effect 3 was a difficult game to score. In fact it's been one of the most difficult games for me to review. You can tell right off the bat that something is off with ME3. Something is seriously wrong. And you know what is wrong with it? It was released way too early. And it shows. When the game begins, you are forced into auto-dialogue. The pacing is terrible. All of a sudden, Reapers are attacking and everyone is shocked. Really? The intro is ****. I remember the release for ME3, it was painful. Yes, this is the game with the near legendary infamous Day 1 DLC. The game release is an obvious console port. The textures are awful; the game looked worse than ME2. That's a big red flag right there. When a sequel's graphics are worse than the preceding title, something is up. Some people say that ""it's the journey, not the destination"", that matters, and I agree with that to a certain extend. The journey itself is not bad in ME3. It follows a similar formula to ME2. ME2's hybrid FPS shooter gameplay is enjoyable in ME3. It's been improved and built upon in ME3. I like that. It **** storytelling. The storytelling and choices, the choices and their results are lacking. Choices that have been made in previous games for some reason do not matter. If someone is killed off, they are convieniently replaced with someone else that has a similar sillset. Some characters are once again completely taken out and you can't get them back in your party. If you made some romance options in ME2 - you might find a half assed romance plot instead. These characters and their stories are just thrown to wind. There are scenes incorporated into ME3, but they feel like add ons and not the full experience. Once again, rushed content and development. These feelings of relationships of both friendship and romance being ""tacked on"" is felt throughout the ENTIRE GAME. And it ****. Bioware has gone to far to kill some characters off screen. That is a cardinal sin in a Bioware game. For example - I romanced Miranda in ME2. Guess what? In ME3, shes not there. She just - disappears. Literally. There is really not fitting conclusion to your relationship - unless of course, you cough up the money for the Citadel DLC. And for some reason, she is....completely out of character. Doing things and acting in ways that you would have never seen in ME2. Now, multiply this times 10. Painful. And unfortunately, the ending is completely and totally botched. Sorry to say it. The ending is awful. Not only is it dark and depressing, but it's relatively obscure in the fact that your choices did not really seem to matter. I understand that it tried to be a self contained game, but that just isn't going to fly for ME3. In the age of DLC's and online downloaded content, Bioware could have taken the risk of making ME3 completely dependant on ME2's save. The ending is so bad, gamers had to come out and demand that Bioware offer a better ending. Yep. You read it right. Bioware actually - was forced - to change the ending. Get it? Gamers had to tell Bioware - let them know - that the ending was botched. How utterly embarrassing for Bioware. This resulted in another embarrassment for the industry, with an editor from IGN coming out defense of Bioware in a stupid, arrogant video, something about ""Gamer entitlement."" Yes, you gamers are not entitled to a good ending. Bioware can do anything they want, and you better shut the hell up and enjoy it, damnit! In ME3, in order to gain resources you must play with other players online. This is a bad decision. Bad, bad bad for a single player game. This was clearly a result of EA meddling in development. The requirement to play online with other players is asinine. Though its not completely mandatory, if you want the ""good"" ending, you pretty much need to do it unless you want ****..""manually edit"" your game. Cough... Overall, ME3 is not a terrible game. But it is not a satisfying conclusion. In fact, the ending itself is kind of laughable. The whole ending sequence, even with the DLC is just too ambiguous and poorly done. It's a real shame. I wanted to like ME3 but its a poor and disappointing conclusion to the series.",5,2015-01-07,PC,user

zylaser,"A disappointing end of the series. It tried to be a self-contained game, but that just renders most of the plot of previous games irrelevant; you stop the Reapers time and time again, and they come anyway. Very few decisions in previous games matter - killed a character earlier? A very similar substitute fills the exact same role. The story has its ups and downs, but doesn't make much sense overall. And that's without getting into the ending - out of place, illogical, just plain dumb. The extended ending does give some nice fluff and closure, but doesn't fix the core issues. The gameplay is mostly the same as in ME 2, but with some decent improvements. There are more abilities and choices when levelling characters. Weapon modifications are nice, but limited in their variety. Having more movement options is nice, but the ""one button does all"" system is annoying as **** You want to roll? Or run, or press a button, or vault over cover, stick to cover, leave the cover? Too bad you're dead as you shuffle around desperately, fighting the contextual controls instead of the enemy.",5,2014-12-08,PC,user

Halefire,"This is an update to my previous review, in which I gave this game a 5. That review was written in the week after release when the infamous ending controversy was just getting underway with more and more people finishing the game. Since then, Bioware has released a large, free patch called the Extended Cut DLC. This was controversial as well, with popular gaming entities like TotalBiscuit still lampooning the game for the endings, but ultimately I feel this extended cut did what it needed to in order to rescue the game. To summarize the new endings rather pithily, while the overall endings haven't necessarily changed, both the final dialogue with a certain spoiler-y character and the actual endings themselves have been *greatly* expanded. Nearly every single issue I found fault with story-wise has been addressed in terms of loose plot threads. Better yet, you now get to see what happens to your companions post-ending, and the context of one or two of the endings has been *significantly* altered. Other DLC since then has also substantially improved my opinion on this game. This game is *by far* the best sci-fi RPG that we've had in a decade, maybe even several decades. It is absolutely beautiful, flows wonderfully, and features a multiplayer mode that initially everyone was apprehensive about but ended up being a wonderfully smooth, engaging experience. I'm re-writing this review again because in all my years of gaming, I think Mass Effect 3 is the one game I have not been able to replay after those first few months simply because I couldn't find enough time to set aside for the post-ME3 depression that inevitably sinks in. No other game has been able to hit me on such an emotional level, and I would argue games like ME3 and Bioshock Infinite (the latter less so perhaps) should be held up as prime examples of gaming as an extremely powerful storytelling medium. Those are the only two games I've ever played for which I need to remove the emotional songs when listening to the sound tracks because I don't need those feels out of the blue during the day. Honestly, were some in-game qualms fixed I would say that such an emotional effect would merit a 10/10. As it stands, what with the ending somewhat-retcon and the fact that Javik is a DLC character, I can only max it out at 9/10 (as much as I hate gaming scores)",9,2014-11-30,PC,user
Mudgee,"Where my interest int the first two of the series weren't strong, ME3 seemed to have that draw, that feel of combat and consequential decision making that I love so much. Any game that promotes choice and consequence is a winner in my books, and ME3 does that very well on many occasions. Whilst i've never been a fan of the combat systems in ME3, It does bode better then the first two. If you were only going to pick up one game in the series, this is the one. Luckily, you do not need an extensive history lesson on ME lore to understand what is going on.",8,2014-11-24,PC,user
Admiral_TSon,"Mass Effect 3 is a worthy conclusion to the Mass Effect trilogy and skillfully immerses the player in the hype and drama that the series has been building to. ME3 is the best written of all of the games in the trilogy, and the user is now able to see how past decisions will impact the expected climax of the series. The series also leaves the player with many choices to be made in this installment too, however, with some of the best political/diplomatic story arcs of any RPG series. While the ending is much chided by fans, I believe it is a logical ending to the series as it resolves the fundamental question/conflict presented to us by the plot in ME1. Pros: -Combat system perfected with options for heavy melee/more combo options/more abilities/options for biotic Shep -Exceptionally well written plot with very dramatic and well-designed cutscenes -Excellent graphics (for 2012) -More fulfilling Romance options + ability to romance select same-sex characters -Interesting and engaging side-quests -Ending resolves fundamental question/conflict in series in a thought-provoking way, making the ME trilogy not just a combat RPG, but a true ""video game novel"" Cons: -While the ending is very well written in fundamentals, the frame by which it is prevented does come across as a somewhat contrived ""Deus ex Machina"" -While side quests are enjoyable, many can only be completed after a certain main mission is completed (but will appear in your journal before you can complete them!) or must be completed before a main mission is completed. This forces a completionist gamer to occasionally research side-quests to make sure they get it done by x or y mission. ME3 is a fitting end to the ME trilogy. With the extended cut DLC, the much-chided ending should be found by gamers who enjoy a good story as a fitting resolution to the questions/conflicts presented throughout the series.",10,2014-11-21,PC,user
Rycr,"A good game with a disappointing ending. To be honest, I never really believed the hype about how every choice throughout the series would have a huge effect on the end result of the game, so in the end I wasn't really disappointed.

araut,"Although most of the reviews are negative, i must say i'm happy with the game overall. The end, tho a bit disappointing, in my opinion, fits (not perfectly) the story constructed so far. Is there a better fitting end? Yes, i believe so, but the presented alternatives are not that bad; but a surviving Shepard would be better, for sure. The major flaws of the game are not in the ending. It has many bugs, some inconsistencies in story line and lore. For example, in ME2 Samara told Shepard that only 3 Ardat-Yakshi existed (her daughters), and we (usually) killed one of them in game. Now in ME3 there are so many that they need a Monastery to remain apart and isolated from society. There are some places to go and many side quests to do, but the only place where you do spent some decent time is the Citadel. There are not huge places with many quests to do, like in ME2 where you spent some good hours in Ilium, Tuchanka, Virmine and Omega, just to name some. The side quests also seems a bit shallow (end too **** with exception of the some moments at the last part of the game, the quests are fairly easy to accomplish. There are some humor on the dialogues, but it seems that, through all the game, you have less options (and even less people to talk to) than you had in ME1 and ME2. The mechanics of armor and weapons and damage are also worse as they were in ME1 and ME2. You buy the upgrade of you current weapon, so shotgun 1 is bought into shotgun 2..3...4 and so on, which takes the ""happiness"" of finding a new upgraded version of your current weapon. Armor customization has its benefits, but it's a bit tricky to compare different armor configurations, since you lack the ""all info in one screen"" tab, so it is harder to see if a +10% shield shoulders do the benefits you're looking for. Mass Effect 1 did a great job in this camp. Here's another problem: percentages. All improvements - weapons and armor - are upgraded by percentages. This is problematic in terms that if you have a low damage weapon, and want to upgrade its damage (in a scenario where you like the other aspects of this particular weapon, like accuracy and reload speed), a 20 % dmg increase won't even show in your graphic readings of that weapon. You would get some results only if there were in game improvements around 200 or 300%. So all is in absolute terms, which in this case is not a good option. A numeric version would be better (like increases damage by 70 points or such). The reapers interfering on galaxy map traveling is a bit pain, and you hardly do some good deed in your travels, because exploration is in short supply here too. I miss Ilium, i miss all those colonies and random quests, but most of all i miss the heavy rpg element. There are too much cinematic sequences and fewer interaction in game. Overall i'd say you have less choices than the 2 previous titles. Bioware saw this so clearly that the next game on the franchise will feature back the old exploration of ME1 (with a better version of the vehicle Mako) and, with some luck, some good space exploration with had on ME2 (like docking on deranged space station). This surely is more an shooter with rpg elements than the otherwise. It is a good game, don' t get me wrong, but surely it was rushed into completion, and those of us who spent hundreds of hours playing the first 2 titles surely will miss a lot of the good elements presented on the past.",7,2014-11-16,PC,user
effataigus,"I recommend doing two things: 1. reading all of those negative reviews, 2. and playing the game anyway. I expected such an awful game after that that I was actually pleasantly surprised. Also, it's now being sold for ~$10 instead of ~$60, sooo... Oh, and the game is pretty annoying if you did play ME1 and 2 and don't have the ""saves"" for them.

HenriqueV,"Of course those bad reviews from gamers are out of place. The end was indeed bad, but it was still a pretty solid game. The gameplay is easily the best one in the series, and the game is really successful in creating an atmosphere where you get the feeling that the world is falling apart and there is little hope left. It wasn't a game that would suit a happy ending. I believe even if the ending wasn't rushed and incomplete, lots of fans would still believe it was bad because it was not a typical ""Star Wars everybody is happy and the world is in peace again"" ending. The big problem with the game for me was the lack of characters interaction. You never get the same depth you did in previous games, specially Mass Effect 2. If one character is not a love interest, then probably you only will get some random lines while you are on Normandy. Another big issue is that, after playing the game, turns out that your decisions during your journey made zero to none impact in the final outcome. ME3 deserved to be the best one of the trilogy, but at the end of the day it was easily the less enjoyable one, perhaps because the game could not fulfill the amount of expectation created by the previous games. But it was also a memorable game and easily one of the best of its generation.",8,2014-11-12,PC,user

Truth_,"I finally got around to playing Mass Effect 3. When all is said in done, I found it to be a fairly solid game. It's combat was not great, but not awful, either. Similarly, the story was excellent at times, and weak at others. Acquiring a crew, learning the lore of new and old, exploring the galaxy, and upgrading you and your teammates was a fulfilling experience, however, little was improved from Mass Effect 2 to 3. Combat was simple with predictable and unintelligent AI (for the most part). Your companions are not particularly useful and can be /very/ powerful if used well and used often. I played on Hard and it was quite easy, like most shooters. Luckily it wasn't too tedious, however. There are enough breaks inbetween combat, exploration, and dialogue which kept a good pace and felt organic. I thought the story was quite good, and I loved so many of the lines and conversations in the game. A+. Obviously there were some cheesy and not so good ones, but all in all I enjoyed it very much. However, I felt some of the dialogue choices were a bit wonky, some didn't make sense, some gave poor options, and some had silly responses that either Shepherd or the other person didn't make sense to me. In combat, some characters seemed to have a lot more unique/useful/interesting things to say than others, which I largely based my party picks off of (EDI, Garrus, and Liara always have interesting or useful comments or observations). Finally, I'm not a huge fan of being forced to pick one reputation type and sticking with it. I feel unless you do 90%+ in one or the other, you miss out on the best dialogue choices, dialogue results, and other things. Mixing and matching your choices, even if you feel they're the best ones logically or in your own role-play playthrough, give you a worse result and worse game. Note: I cannot comment on Day 1 DLC (which is these days quite common) since I only just got it. I also can't comment on the old ending, as I've only experienced the new one. Lastly, I cannot comment on the multiplayer as I have not played it (but I've heard good things).

I've always been far far more invested in each dialogue scene as I was in the action, and it seemed to just slow down for me every time I had to take on another hoard of cannibals.

A lot of the screaming here is likely because you become attached to Shepard and want to play her in a Mass Effect 4, you want it to keep going because you made her and you like her and you're invested in her. Trilogies are good for movies and books and they can be good for video games too. Let BioWare move on...I'm interested to see what they do after DA is done...they'll need a new adventure trilogy and look at what they've done/learned with their DA and mass effects series.

Firstly, let me tell you that the DLCs improve the game massively, and it easily deserves a 9 at least. Most if not all of the negative reviews are caused by the ending, which the DLC fixes, so no reason not to give the game a higher rating once you get the DLC, (which is available for free). The other DLCs need to be paid for but boy are they great! In short, the DLCs improve the game massively-especially the Citadel DLC, awesome, and I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish.

Pallowin,"This used to be my favorite franchise. I have put at least 500 hours into ME1 and ME2, all in preparation for ME3. I wanted to have the perfect save file ready, so I could see how my choices would add up in ME3. What I got, however, was a rushed mess, that didn't even deliver on half of the promises made. The game knew that it had a lot of knots to tie, relating to the different side missions and characters I had interacted with in my many playthroughs of ME1+2. This was solved mostly by lazily sending an email to you ingame, telling you that ""This char did this, and now he/she is dead"" or ""Hello, I am xxx you helped my with yyy a while back, thanks"" The characters didn't feel like the characters from the first two games, they felt a little ""off"". Like they were written by a different person (which turned out to be correct). This became blatantly obvious the farther I got. I often had the feeling that ""this person would not say this"" or ""this person would not do this"" The zones/planets/places you visited felt small and confined, I felt like I traversed one long corridor with no option to explore or branch off the given path. Decisions you made felt superficial, and I didn't feel like I had an impact on the world, contrary to the two previous games, This was mostly because the game focused on completing old storylines, poorly, instead of creating some new ones as well. The whole game I had a bad feeling about these occurrences, and when I reached the end, the game simply caved in on itself. I could only sit there and stare at the screen completely silent. Then, as something I can only assume was a joke, the DLC message popped up: ""Commander Shepard has become a legend by ending the Reaper threat. Now you can continue to build that legend through further gameplay and downloadable content"" I simply shut the game off, uninstalled Origin, and I haven't touched an EA game since. The fact that I stumbled over this in late 2014 and still feel angry, is a testament to how much this game disappointed me. This game has ruined my love for the two previous ones as well, as I sit back with a ""what's to point"" feeling whenever I feel like playing ME1 or ME2. If you haven't played the Mass Effect series, I would recommend you to only play the first two games, and forget that this stinker exists. ...And lastly, looking at the professional critic score, is a perfect indicator of what is wrong with game journalism today.",4,2014-10-16,PC,user

Kyle2086,"As far as the epic conclusion to the Mass Effect trilogy goes, 3 is a mixed bag. On the one hand, it starts out amazingly, where you feel like the fate of the galaxy is at stake and every race that inhabits it, for better or worse. Unfortunately, after a great start, it stumbles, then falls flat on it's face in the end. If by the end of ME3 you're left wondering what happened, even with the end game DLC, you're not alone. This game could never meet every fan's expectations, and there's no way bioware could have made all the choices the player made over the course of 3 games end in an exponential number of endings, but when it's all said and done, your choices are essentially rendered inconsequential. The game is very playable, and re-playable, and you can easily get your money's worth out of the entertainment values presented here, just don't go into it with high expectations.",8,2014-10-01,PC,user
RimJobson,"Bioware has been progressively dumbing down the immersion felt in the Mass Effect universe, starting with the transition from Mass Effect to Mass Effect 2 and now dealing the killing blow with the final game in this wonderful trilogy. Don't get me wrong, Mass Effect 3 was a solid single-player experience; however, this is not about a ""solid single-player experience"", this is about the third game in a series known for its immersiveness and ability to make you feel empathy for its characters. In this game, that immersion has been diluted to the point of many characters having their purpose in the overall plot made negligible and simply added in to provide a cameo for the fans of other Mass Effect fiction (see: James Vega), and this unfortunately includes our protagonist: the one character you were supposed to feel connected with given the game's status as an ""RPG"". Sure, some of this was solved by DLC, but the simple fact that we're talking about ""solving problems"" for a game that spent a sizeable amount of time in development means that there is a problem. But, that is all about the immersion. The crippling point of this game - for I had foolishly thought that the game could still be saved - was not the lack of immersion, it was the poorly developed plotline that had great beginning. Having been built-up by the first two games in the trilogy, I expected that the pacing and ultimate resolution of the plot would not leave me with a sour taste in my mouth as it did. The plotline is developed in a ridiculously cliché manner, to the point that it feels like I was watching a series of overly edited cinematics with gameplay only serving as a buffer between viewings. Is it a bad thing per se? No, but this takes us back to this game's position as the third game in its series, meaning that it has a certain standard to live up to and a certain method of gameplay that a player of such a series would expect. The new method of delivering the plot is disjointing at best and game-ruining at worst, with me leaning closer to the latter end of the spectrum. Finally, we get to the ending (with me addressing the vanilla ending, as I should be). While not absolutely terrible, it does leave enormous gaps of ""What happened?"" moments that should NOT be happening with the closer of a series. Sure, inference and speculation are alright if another game was to be expected, but the this is the final game of the series that would star Commander Shepard, so this game - as the other 2 provided - should have given us a sense of finality even if it was not decisively final. While Leviathan fixed many of the holes that were exhaustively mentioned by reviewers, there should not have been anything to fix (refer to my DLC rant). Tl;dr - The game was decent as a single-player experience, awful as a multiplayer experience, atrocious as a Mass Effect game, and the apotheosis of plot failure as a Mass Effect trilogy finisher. Mass Effect 3 made me experience a thought that should never be experienced with an RPG, much less one as wonderful as Mass Effect: ""Do I really want to play this again?""",5,2014-09-27,PC,user
Chr0m3,"Mass Effect 3 is a phenomenal experience, and a fitting end to the Mass Effect trilogy. The stakes have never been higher, the action never as intense, and by the end of the game, when you arrive back at Earth with every fleet you've gathered and finally bring the fight to the Reapers, it would be hard to not at least cheer for the Galaxy that you've known and loved for three games, finally putting aside old grudges and conflicts to work together as a united force. Bioware also hasn't held back in the emotional scenes of Mass Effect 3, from the opening scene where a Reapers destroyer mercilessly destroys a shuttle escaping with a child on board, to the deaths of many main characters and the nightmares that Shepard goes through, this game really pulled at my heartstrings. Of course, there is the ending, which caused much controversy for its abrupt end without providing resolution to long time fans of the series, however as I only played the game after the release of the Extended Cut DLC, I was satisfied with the ending, it was not the best way to end the series, but it was fine in my honest opinion, and overall, Mass Effect 3 was one of the most amazing and compelling games I have ever had the pleasure of playing.",9,2014-09-24,PC,user
Voodoo123,"I highly regret this full price preorder this is one of the few times I have ever pre purchased a videogame believing it a solid bet. I played and completed both ME1 & 2 but something about this title really offended me as PC gamer. The plastic and lifeless visuals coupled with a bland 'illusion of choice' script leaves the characters feeling unrealistic and the locations static. Maybe I have just been spoiled by recent gaming highs (TLOU, GTAV, BF4) but where is the quality this time? Where are 2012 level AAA character animations, voice emotion and smart dialogue. Makes me think then why bother releasing this rubbish? Looks like the space RPG genre still has room on the shelf. Highly regret this purchase.",5,2014-09-12,PC,user
rmcfc1988,I can sum this game up in one sentence....... Great game terrible ending. Mass effect 3 takes the refined combat of ME2 and adds further improvements out of the entire trilogy I feel that ME3 has the best and most balanced combat system. The main storyline is strong right up until priority sanctuary where it takes a steep nosedive. Overall Bioware plays to its strengths ME3 has a strong cast of memorable characters and a meaningful storyline that makes ME3 a nearly perfect end to Shepard's stroyline. That said ME3 does have its problems 1) Fetch missions are quite lazy and feel like an afterthought to the campaign 2) Poor animations at times characters will jerk and do physically impossible things head twisting being a memorable moment 3)Galaxy at war was not fleshed out and had no meaningful impact other than a red/green/blue ending (expanded on slightly with the Extended cut). 4) Kai Leng was poorly implemented and felt like a joke. Easily one of the more frustrating moments of the game given that he is made out to be your equal but is laughably stupid most of the time which makes his cutscene wins over you incredibly frustrating. 5) A more personal one for me was the treatment of Ashley Williams she had just two scenes and was only usable after the first half of the game. I've had this game since release but have chosen to review not to give it the score I think it deserves and not one based on the disappointment I had after release. The reason I can give it a 9/10 is due to the fact that the problems only represent 10% of the game and as such I enjoyed the other 90% enough to give it a good score. This is a great game and even though I believe it deserves a 9/10 I cannot help but focus on the negative aspects of the **** has to be the worst ending to a game that I have ever played. Get it right with DAI Bioware!!!!!,9,2014-09-06,PC,user

The game play is refined and engaging, the combat is very good, I really like the multiplayer and played countless hours with it, the story is very nice, I see tons of cameos and my decisions reflecting back from the first game and they don't feel forced at all. The buildup, the tension, the writing, the voice acting, the graphics are all brilliant. I deducted 2 points because: 1st obviously cash-grab DLCs that feel like cutout content (day 1 removed character, important story DLCs like Leviathan), 2nd the ending is a disgrace even with the extended cut. It was okay I mean, but the whole buildup for the final confrontation felt utterly pointless and I felt I was cheated in a way. I like how the company reflected on it (extended cut, free DLCs), but still there was no official apology.

Buu,"Mass Effect 3 seems like a experiment to get everything present at Video-Games 101 and throw it out of the window. Even the usual ""Boss Fight"" was sold as ""too videogamey"" idea and cut from it. Things that don't work include poorly designed introduction, quests that are gotten without indication or interaction with NPCs, and always end in a mini-game of scan-and-run fetch. Inventory still horrible to manage, and quest details and progress are inexistent. The great voice actors from the previous games are faded by the bad story and cheesy lines. In fact most of the older characters return completely ""out-of-character"", to progress a story with lots of violence and deaths. Even classic features from the series are defaced. The dialog wheel doesn't follow the classic options of decisions, investigation and actions anymore, and the amount of auto-dialog is significant. Besides that, most of the history is preset and don't change based on your decisions and what changes are only showed as scores, changing nothing in the actual game, until the very end, when you're just told that had a consequence. Not showed, just TOLD. DLCs still being sold only by Bioware points, which never change price. Thing that cause the each of larger DLCs, which are just a fraction of the game, to cost even MORE than the base game. And the worst feature of the game was the ending. One ending that retroactively ruined the 2 great game that precede it. An ending that was included in literature college courses as subject of how to not deliver a narrative. Mass Effect was once called the Star Trek of this generation, but this third game was so revolting that made writers from ""the Next Generation"" to rise their voices and protest to what was made with the story. It's an ending that will live forever in infamy and is revolting in many levels. If you're a fan of the franchise and loved the first two games, but never touched this third instance, refrain yourself, and consider the second game the end of Shepard's tale. There is always hope that in the future the IP will fall in more competent hands, and they will consider ME3 never happened, and write a proper end for this Epic.",0,2014-06-17,PC,user

Charlemagne,"It's mediocre as a movie but complete fails as a game. It's the kind of game where I would rather the game just play itself and I watch (twice - once good guy, once bad guy). There is no real freedom, you are on a railroad, and now and then there is a fork (a choice)... but usually the game designer has decided that some choices are less valid than others and will punish you for making them, basically forcing their moral world view on you. And the rhyme and reason of it is quite irrational - the game rewards you for picking fights with strangers doing things the designers expect you to disapprove of, but punishes you for not committing genocide of the last of some ant creature. It's fitting that it has such a bad ending, because the entire thing was bad. Most levels offer no freedom of movement, you are funneled by invisible walls, and have fixed objections that you must complete. Which might be right for a racing car game, but not in what is suppose to be an 'adventure' game... an 'adventure' game where you are not free to actually adventure. It fails as an adventure game because of the lack of freedom, and it fails as an action game because of the lack of depth to the combat... leaving the player with nothing rewarding except a mediocre story that the game demands you jump through hoops to see. I didn't play it through, I watched what I missed on YouTube.",0,2014-06-02,PC,user

Honestly, I don't get the hate. The ending is perfectly fitting. The game mechanics are fantastic, very polished, and rarely monotonous. Enjoy it for what it is, a perfectly good way to end the series. Mass Effect 2 will always be the better game, but for me this is not the great big turd some people want it to be. Considering the amount of sub-standard fare that gets spewed out by big game companies these days, the kind of re-heated **** we see regurgitated by Activision every few months, we should be glad this is actually a decent game.",7,2014-05-16,PC,user

Bioware ""fixed the problem"" when they killed most of them off by the Reapers. When I first read about Mass Effect Bioware had just finished Knights of the Old Republic. They were making a trilogy where your actions in all three games would affect the ending in third one. Bioware lied to me to the tune of 160 bucks. They only gave one ending with four options. In order to have your actions truly affect the ending, a happy ending has to be possible. The extended cut DLC is nothing more then damage control and selling Mass Effect 4.

FatherKarras,"Certainly a mixed bag, Mass Effect 3 is a game which is disappointing in a multitude of aspects, ranging from the bland action orientated combat, massive plot holes and poorly written characters and quite possibly one of the worst endings I have ever experienced in gaming. After a tense and emotional introduction, the game quickly goes down hill. Shepard, a character whom you define, is whisked away on an epic space adventure to save the universe after the Reapers finally made it to the galaxy. Somehow, this entire time no one had listened to Shepard, even though there has been excellent reasons to, now everyone is boned. After a game of boring combat (having chose my Infiltrator class who has been leveled up since the first game, I could one shot almost anytime of enemy in the game with a rifle), characters making stupid decisions and a forced character by the name of Kei-Lang, you finally reach the end... And oh boy... Did it ****. Terrible ending aside, the game had some genuine sad moments, such as the deaths of some of my favorite characters... But overall, a weak passage and pals in comparison to the amazing previous installments. Positives: Fun multiplayer. Multiple/difficult choices. Genuine sad moments. Great soundtrack. Ends multiple story lines and you get to say your final goodbyes. Negatives: Boring combat. Plotholes... Plotholes EVERYWHERE. Poorly written side characters. Vague motives. Horrible quest tracker.

Troublewalking,"I got this game free for my Origin account as part of the debacle that was the release of SimCity. To make up for that mess, Origin gave us a choice of one free game. I chose Mass Effect 3. Up till then I had Mass Effect 2, and Mass Effect 1. Though I have to admit I was never really a fan of Mass Effect 1, as I didn't discover it until way past it's due date. And by then the once top of the line graphics were horrendous to deal with. However, I think Mass Effect 2 explains why so many people love this series. For it's time the graphics were amazing. The mini games which added to the fun were classic. You got to chose good or bad options. You got to choose your class and skill set, and upgrade as you saw fit. The team member stories were pretty good. And it was just a solid game. So when I got Mass Effect 3, I had high expectations. However the reason I never purchased the game before was that I heard EA had dropped the ball on Mass Effect 3. Now there are certainly things that were disappointing about Mass Effect 3. But these disappointments need to be tampered by whether your a fan of the series or not. Obviously disappointed fans of the series would give this game much harsher than needed reviews of the game. Which needs to be kept in mind, because if I had never played a Mass Effect game. Mass Effect 3 would be considered a 10 to me. But seeing the drop in quality from iMass Effect 3 compared to Mass Effect 2 I can understand some of the fans strong feelings against the game. And is the main reason I give the game only an 8. In short Mass Effect 3 just is missing some of the core things which made the Mass Effect series so great. The mini games were gone. They tweaked the classes, mostly in a bad way. They all but eliminated the companions or team member side stories. They didn't really have tie ins with the team members you grew to love in the other stories. And then to add insult to injury the ending seems like EA was trying to put an abrupt end to the series. So you need to understand that the majority of the bad reviews are from loyal fans of the series who felt they were robbed by the direction EA chose to go with the game for Mass Effect 3. Again as a stand alone game for someone new to the franchise it is definitely worth getting. But as the 3rd in the series it unapologetically tries to rip the heart of the franchise out and stomp on it. They probably imagined they would win all kinds of awards for a hardcore story. But instead made a lot of fans unhappy. Fortunately EA tried to do some face saving and put in some patches that allow for some happy endings. Though it seems like you have to farm points to make that happen. And that takes away from the story. And story is one of the things Mass Effect is great at. So even though Mass Effect 3 is not nearly as good as Mass Effect in my opinion. It is still a solid game. Just terribly disappointing if your a fan of the franchise. The game is good enough to keep enjoying. I have all 3 on my computer. And purchased a cheap 1-3 Xbox 360 version. Also if your a fan of KOTOR the games are very similar. It's the freedom to choose the way you want to play, and the way your skills level up.

rhymesmatter,0...There is nothing else you can give this travesty and attempt from EA to leech money out of their fans not thinking about the consequences. BioWare did everything wrong here: from unimportant and speedy sidequests to a toilet flush ending where NONE of the choices you made mattered(Please don't give us the crap about The Director's Cut DLC...BARELY made an impact and a little to late) Everything good that ME and ME2 managed to do with our Shepared experience was beaten to pulp and into submission by this horrendous closing to the Trilogy leaving me (and apparently half of the ppl that played it) a bitter aftertaste that's impossible to wash off.Well Done BioWare! Well Done EA! you can have your ME . That was not the game we came to love and enjoy. ME 4 is DEFINITELY going to be CoD clone! i am counting on that,0,2014-03-01,PC,user
Dalesworth,"It's not perfect, but Mass Effect 3 is a fantastic game. It improved on ME2 in several ways and took some steps back in others, but at its core, I feel like it's a slightly different kind of game. 2 had a very personal and intimate feel, assembling an elite team for a deadly mission. 3 is much more grand and sweeping in its scale and scope, and therefore has a less focused story. The gameplay has seen a steady sense of improvement throughout the series (remember how awkward the first one was to actually play?) and the RPG elements make a more pronounced appearance in the third game, though it is still largely a shooter with some skill progression. The shooting mechanics are more fluid and the weapons and abilities more diverse. The sound design and voice acting are both fantastic (mostly), as is the art design. As for the writing, I feel like the writers manage the the more intimate and moment-to-moment writing more effectively than the large, overarching plot. the way the Normandy's crew interact with each other and move around on board makes the ship feel much more alive than ever before. There were plenty of nice touches, from meeting old friends to little in-jokes and fan service. Unfortunately it seems like the team wrote themselves into a corner with all of the branching decisions in past games, and not all of them paid off in meaningful ways. And finally, there's the ending. I didn't like it. I thought it was a cop-out and honestly it made next to no sense and was very thematically different from the rest of the story. It was unsatisfying and some of the fan-made theories that cropped up afterwards were much better. However, I respect the creative team's position and think that DEMANDING a new ending is childish and a sign of ""gamer entitlement."" The extended cut made the ending as good as it could have been without fundamentally changing it and in the end, it really is about the journey and not the destination. I had a blast playing though this game as well as the whole series. ten minutes of unsatisfying drivel at the end is a bummer, but this is still one of my favourite series of all time, and I wont let that ruin the hundreds of hours that I've poured into it. All in all, this is a Mass Effect game and I can look past awkward design choices and some poor writing to just enjoy the ride and hope for more in the future.",9,2014-02-27,PC,user

Annoyingly consolish controls for not demanding players, operated basically by one button to cover/use did not help either. Graphics were pretty good so not a complete zero.

dyspeptic,"Played: Jan 2014 Pros: + Actually wraps up the Mass Effect story arc + Inventory compromises between simplicity (ME2) and variety (ME1) + Additional Ending content is free Cons: - Character models don’t look updated from ME2 - Some items are highly missable and a bug seems to keep some from appearing in a store if missed I was introduced to the series through Mass Effect 2, which offered some significant streamlining to make gameplay more fun than its predecessor. I eventually played ME1, but based on reviews I’d read I didn’t want to splash out $60 for ME3 so it was some time before the price came down to what I was comfortable paying. I’m glad I waited. While the story arc is completed with reasonable effectiveness, it features at least one prominent fallacy that I found somewhat insulting to my intelligence. After some public outcry, Bioware released some (free) additional content to explain the results of your end-game choice-and it’s a good thing it’s free, since it adds about 30sec of content. On the other hand, this series ending compares favorably compared with the non-endings featured in the string of Assassin’s Creed games by developer Ubisoft (up to you to decide if that comparison actually says anything). Gameplay mechanics are mostly solid, featuring a more flexible inventory that that presented in ME1, but still simplified enough that it doesn’t feel like a loot game: there are only about 5 options for each weapon type. The player can carry and use any type of weapon desired, however “heavy” weapons (anything not pistol or SMG) severely curtail use of powers. I played this on the default difficulty setting (apparently equivalent to the “Hard” setting on ME2) and only died a few times; even on death the checkpoint system allowed me to return to action and complete the game+90% of sidequests in about 50 hours. Relevant to gameplay is the occurance of “missable” items, which are supposed to appear in a special store if you fail to pick them up. Unfortunately, through some kind of bug or other problem, these items did not appear in store for me (I looked them up online to try to figure out how to complete the remaining quests). The rewards would have been small, but it is annoying to be missing a feature that is supposed to come with the game. There were a few things that I found even more disappointing. The character models feature the same faces and hairstyles as in previous games, and don’t appear to be any better rendered than previously. In the same vein, the pre-rendered cutscenes look as though they came straight from 2005 and it is something of a relief when they end and you are allowed to return to your machine's real-time rendering. In short: the graphics don’t seem to have improved at all since ME2, though why this would be the case is a mystery to me. IN SUMMARY: ME3 is a decent game to pick up if you like the idea of a shooter/RPG hybrid with a team. It is certainly worth the $15 or so EA games is currently charging, but still suffers from some pitfalls and you shouldn't pay more for it.",7,2014-02-12,PC,user
RunicDragons,"I really want to give this game a 10. Or I really did want to. I do not think this game deserves a 0-5 because of the ending alone, like so many people are doing here. The whole game was very emotional and the connections between characters has never been stronger. I do admit that I cried in the ending, but at the time I thought I just got the bad ending and that I had to make better choices next time. But nope, it turned out that that wasn't the case. Like so many others, I was left hugely disappointed. But after having accepted the fact that that's the way it ends, I have seen this game in a whole new positive light. I also want to mention the official soundtracks. They're simply amazing, full of emotions and tension. Overall, Mass Effect 3 may not be the best in the series, but it's certainly not a bad game.

boshi,"a wonderful game and great ending to the trilogy. the story follows you as you try to find support from the other races of the galaxy to try to fight the reapers. the story, as usual is great,however i disliked the lack of loyalty missions that were in mass effect 2, as well as the much smaller team you have at your disposal, limiting your choices of squadmates. the graphics are top notch as well, as well as the game-play, aside from a few minor glitches i found. along with the single player, there is a surprisingly enjoyable co-op multiplayer mode, where you and up to 3 other people fight waves of enemies across various locations in the galaxy. the enemy faction variants are cerberus, geth, collector, and reaper. playing the co-op mode increases galactic readiness percentage, which in short, allows you to use more of your forces in the final push.",10,2014-02-10,PC,user

amorphousblob,"The good and bad of Mass Effect 3: Good: 1. Vastly improved levelling system that gives a noticeable upgrade with every skill point added. 2. Much more weapon variety. 3. Good weapon modding. Bad: 1. Terrible controls which rely on one button for virtually every action. Attempting to use an object while moving often results in the character launching themselves across the room or getting out of cover, also no crouch button means the character sometimes stands up in the middle of fire-fights. 2. Stupid ally AI. Allies are happy to stand out of cover while getting shot at, disappear in the middle of fights or refuse to shoot at enemies. 3. Levelling is way too fast. In the first mission for example I increased my level three times. 4. Side missions are boring. The majority of side missions involve jumping to a sector and right clicking a few times. These are necessary for game completion and a real chore. 5. Player interaction is limited. Much crew interaction does not occur in cut-scenes and player has no control over their own responses. Dialog during missions is within cut-scenes but player still does not get to choose as many responses as in previous games. A Cynical person might assume this problem is due to laziness on the writers/animators part. 6. Non player characters are boring. Character development appears to have taken a back seat in this game as both new and returning characters have little to say. The only interesting development I caught was jokers relationship but I managed to miss its resolution. 7. Decisions in previous games appear to have little impact. 8. Terrible level design. Levels are designed in a boxy arena style and clearly just recycled multiplayer maps, recycled so lazily as to have loads of ammo caches everywhere. 9. Mandatory multiplayer. In order to get a good ending player is required to play multiplayer battles. This effectively precludes players with poor internet from experiencing some of the single player content. 10. Dull, dull, dull combat. Most of the interesting enemies appear to have been removed: In combat I have mostly just faced a load of dudes with progressively bigger guns. 11. Plot points from previous games are ignored. Shepard appears to answer to the alliance now when he was a spectre in the previous game for example. There are tonne more issues but really it all boils down to this: In attempting to broaden their customer base Bioware have turned the most exciting and deep RPG/FPS ever into a complete mess with little appeal to lovers of either genre. Both of the prequels I have played many times, including all the DLC, but ME3 was only good enough to get me to play until about five minutes into the final mission once. A huge disappointment.

gobSIDES,"An absolutely terrible end to a great series. Reeks of a company trying to expand the target market of their game at the worse possible time and without taking proper concern as to the affect it would have on the game.

Gameplay is largely the same though let down by very far behind the times graphics and laughable animations.

COMThing,"Excellent game with much a more fluid combat experience than the previous 2 games. The Good: - Customisation is much improved over ME2. The number of weapons available has been greatly increased to roughly 8 per category and the upgrade system includes weapon mods/attachments. Amour is very customisable with interchangeable parts and a much more user-friendly customisation interface than ME2 - Combat is much more fluid and ammunition isn't really a problem (no more 15 rounds total carrying capacity for a certain shotgun) compared to ME2. The addition of heavy melee is another factor to consider when choosing your class and adds more combos. - Dialogue and voice acting is very well done overall, often times making up for the number of plot holes - Probably the best soundtrack of the series The Bad: - Lacks a decent inventory system: Picking up 1 weapon and being able to equip everybody with it makes it seem more shallow than ME1. In addition, not being able to sell items of any sort takes away from the role-playing experience - Side missions have very little reward and offer very little replay value. When they do have a useful function, they usually end up being tedious and are too simple to actually feel like a mission (Sometimes very close to being as short as the cutscene and dialogue that introduces the mission) - The plot has many holes in it and none of the DLCs fix these issues; rather just add more holes. Skip this game if you require a somewhat believable story. SIDE NOTE - there is a community edited cinematic ending that greatly improves the experience - Squad AI is still terrible and the limited interactions you can do with them just makes them a distraction so you don't die too quickly",8,2014-01-12,PC,user

stern,"In this third and final release, slowly the narrative coherence of Mass Effect eroded, until near the end, at a fast pace it completly crumbled. In ME2 you could say that the villains were unjustified and meaningless in a narrative sense, you could say that choices, events and positions were forced into your character and many were literally asspulls, but at least ME2 provided plenty of well written and thoughtful content in the form of loyality missions for example, to couterbalance this. In ME3 there is no such thing and what starts as a contrived, average to bad story, end as a complete mess with giant holes where obviously the writers or devs didn't know what they were doing. Or if you played Deus Ex 1, a classical and mind-blowing game unlike ME3, you'll simply know that ME3 ending is a rip off, out of thone, feel and athmosphere from the rest of ME series and even from the rest of the third game itself, not addressing any of the questions and propositions that the ending should address. Mission after mission asspulls are thrown at the player and they are supposed to contain core elements of the narrative without any connection with the previous games. ""Oh, you know, we found the ancient plans to this super-weapon, we don't even know what it does, but it's our only hope! Why didn't I mention these ancient plans before? I don't know"", ""Oh, the genophage was stabilished as a necessary evil, was even fully approached in a previous game? Too bad, let's use it again in the narrative in a total different way!"", ""You reproggammed heretic Geths? Nah, it didn't change anything!"", ""Forget Ilos and the Conduit, forget Haelstrom!"" and so on, with even poorer resolutions than before, sometimes even with implausible forever happy conclusions, where magically everything worked out for everyone and butterflies and rainbows are in the sky. As for other aspects, some can be praised: they finally fleshed out powers, cooldowns and shields/armors/barriers, even adding power combos, making the gameplay as a pure adept or as an enginner very interesting. Too bad the game fail to explain this and you are supposed to search in the internet for a guide to which power detonates the other and what defense is vulnerable to what power (for example, energy drain is useless against armor, carnage is useless against shield, etc). The combat system is finally fun and interesting if you have patience to micromanage your squadmates, because they are useless otherwise and never use the proper powers if left by themselves. Other aspects must be criticized: the missions journal is confusing and doesn't match the missions name in the galaxy map, the weapons customization is dumbed down and mostly useless, upgrading equipment is a chore, side missions are utterly boring and repetitive, re-using multiplayer maps and the same mission model (active console A, hold postion B, etc), there are plenty and I mean plent of bugs even so long after release, sometimes advancing the main plot makes side missions expire and several, several characters are out of character or at least with very poorly written lines. The game feels short and I wonder if this is because they decided to focus on multiplayer instead. Unlike ME2, I can't recommend any DLC except for Javik. Citadel is cringe worthy and apparently made for 15 years old, Leviathan is stupid, inspired by movies such as Abyss and presents more implausible asspulls than answers, Omega is boring and will make you skip full dialogues out of boredom. ME3 is so bad that makes ME1 a master piece in comparison, it'll age bad and be a waste of your time. I recommend reading the relevant plot in wikis and skip this game. Too bad they are making a 4th installation, I predict a even worse product.",3,2014-01-08,PC,user

m8cct,"Mass Effect 3 gets a bad rap, I'm here to say that it is the best of all the Mass Effect games. ME3 combines the best elements of the first two installments: it takes the vastly improved game play of Mass Effect 2 and makes it even more fluid, more stream lined and more exciting. I appreciated the slightly expanded level-up system and weapons choices, even if still lacking from the ME1 days. I didn't care for the graphics upgrade between 1 and 2, but I appreciated the overhaul in this one. Story-wise, ME3 succeeded where its predecessor failed. The fact that BioWare decided not to encore 15 hours of utterly unengaging ""team building"" was a great start. The plot feels less like a grocery list, and more like an actual moving timeline, where Shepard really is interacting with the galaxy at large and taking actions that effect it. The old crew is mostly back, and the Normandy is an alliance ship again. All is right with the world. I didn't struggle to find a reason to care. This game rediscovers the clarity of purpose that the series began with. I hear grumblings about how the Mass Effect storyline simply became too linear, and that complaint might be valid. I never said the game was perfect. I still prefer linearity to whatever the hell ME2 was supposed to be. It might not be very RPG-like with the little things it does, but it is still very much an RPG in the bigger picture. You made a lot of choices in 1 and 2 that are going to directly affect 3 and you're going to make more choices in 3. It's easy to forget how many branching story lines there are a play in this series and the kind of effort BioWare put into making sure the player feels fully invested in whichever one they might find themselves in, and as always, the script and voice acting is top notch. Are the last 15 minutes of the game unworthy of the Mass Effect series? Yes, it's all true. It's sad to see that the ending completely lacked the thought and care that the rest of the story got throughout the saga, but the ending has it where it counts; the final mission is difficult and thrilling, even if the bits following it fail to win hearts.",9,2014-01-02,PC,user

However this is the first time I totally regret not reading any reviews on ME3 before playing it. Although I admit i've been hearing countless praises for its prior titles. Mass Effect 3 was my introduction to the series as I have not played the prior games yet (and I must admit, ME3 is totally preventing me from playing it). Im sure ME fans know that this game has its own very unique atmosphere while containing many moral and philosophical twists. I was immediately hooked on to the game thinking this might be one of my favorite games in my life. To be honest, ME3 Gameplay was pretty good at the least above average in my opinion. It was very interesting, entertaining until the end where (keep in mind, ME3 was an introduction to Mass Effect for me) it just became flat out abysmal and insulting. Non, and I mean NON of my hard thought decisions throughout the game even mattered in the end and I can't imagine what it would have been like to the players who spent so much time on previous titles. Im not sure what the writers were thinking but when I heard that damned space kid at the end telling me the few options I have, I knew they made a BIG mistake.

The game play and physics are clunky, the graphics very outdated, the cover system gets you killed more often than it saves you. The Reapers, who are supposed to be the most devastating enemy we've ever seen, are so easy to take it, its laughable.

The characters the second game spent so long building felt largely absent except for cameos. The choices made in previous games had absolutely no noticeable impact. The lore from the first game felt completely abandoned by this point, and the replacement arc was nowhere near the scope or impact.

MarsLars,"It's been a year since this game was released, and still people cannot get over the ending. If I ask someone if they've ever played Mass Effect, the answer is usually a no, because they're uncultured swine, or because ""The ending of 3 ****, so I never started."" I am truly disappointed with BioWare's fans. This studio gave us one of the greatest sci-fi stories (and universes) of all time. It was lauded by critics and consumers alike. People developed actually feelings toward these characters. All of this is overshadowed by an ending that disappointed. Mass Effect 3 is a good game. There, I said it! Come at me Internet! Yes, it is a little more action/shooter oriented than the previous two, but hey, it's the third installment of a trilogy. This game was aimed at hard core fans (don't you dare disagree!) and those who were breaking in to the franchise, so it's obvious that they would want to up the ante, to appeal to those action game junkies (Thanks, Activision.). But why, WHY all the hate? Please everyone, don't penalize the experience just because of a conclusion that you didn't enjoy. People would've been distraught not matter what they did. I feel like most of these negative reviews are people just getting wrapped up in the internet fervor, not actual, unbiased reviews. I personally loved the ending up through the final choice, though I feel the results should have been expanded, but guess what? They did! BioWare appeased the masses with a free-of-charge expansion that provides better clarity. Anyways, what I'm trying to say is, if, by chance, someone reads this, I hope I can inform some lucky person with an interest in RPG's to not worry and to have fun, to see through all the bitterness. I can sleep better at night knowing I introduced someone to a new, exciting world. Thanks BioWare, and Reader, ENJOY!",9,2013-11-26,PC,user

avrell,"Storytelling, RPG elements and dialogue have all disintegrated a significant degree since ME2. Any illusion of some greater adventure is no longer there. You have an L shaped corridor after another to clear of enemies. With above in mind, this game can only be seen as a cover shooter such as Gears of War. Considering how other game elements have been either abandoned, simplified or streamlined, it is curious how clumsy and void of fun the shoot em up bits are. Nothing about moving and controlling Shepard feels intuitive. Decision to cram taking cover and sprinting behind same button results in plenty of mid combat situations where you really have no idea what will happen when you press the lottery button.

KotorFan3231,"KotorFan3231-This is definitely one of the best games i have ever played, and personally one of my favorites of all time. The story and characters are above average in fact they are the best i have ever seen in any game to date. There is so much emotion in the dialogue, the action is intense, well presented, and cinematic. The choices your character makes are more impact full. There is one instance in the game i won't spoil for anyone but it involves the Geth, and Tali, and one of the choices made me feel so much emotion i almost cried. Fortunately i ran into very little glitches. My personal favorite character from this game other than commander Shepard is The Illusive Man voice by Martin Sheen, he is well voiced, and character is well written. Now the only other problem with the game that i found was there were less companions, but each were interesting so that didn't bother me that much. For the people who say the ending ruined the game it didn't yes the original ending did not solve much it was just inconclusive but did not ruin the whole game. The ending did not interfere with my experience because overall the writing was extremely strong. There is a massive amount of content in this game. It took me 30+ hours. Overall i give this game a 10, and it does not mean that the game is perfect it just means the pros far outweigh the cons.",10,2013-11-12,PC,user
SneezeJunky,Without a doubt the best series i've ever come to play! So much replay value! Its insane and I can't describe it enough. THIS IS A MUST BUY AND PLAY EXPERIENCE. Trust me on this! I don't understand why people are complaining about the endings. Do not be scared of the low user score. trust me when I tell you. This game is awesome and you wohn't regret playing it Pros: Just... wow (useless pros. I know :v) Story and characters are so well done! Cons: Combat can get a little linear No coop :/ End of the series,10,2013-11-07,PC,user

raven5434,"Great continuation of the Mass Effect saga and a great improvement over the gameplay and combat of the prior 2 games. The storyline is also brilliant and really **** you into the game. I would have given the game a 10, however I gave it an 8 simply because of the rather abrupt conclusion of the game. I disagree with some of the other posts, in that I think the end choices are fine if the game didn't seem like it ended so abruptly without a lot of explanation. I was left Googling what the endings meant after I finished the game and I don't feel like I should have to do that. Overall, I put off buying this game for a long time due to the negative user reviews. However, after playing the game though, I do not regret getting it at all, and only simply regret not getting it earlier. Great game overall.",8,2013-10-17,PC,user

Pork_chops,"The game was fairly rushed, that's obvious, and very little has been done in the years after to help fix that. The storyline is solid, and after a BIG DLC patch, the ending isn't as eye gougingly terrible as it was, the multiplayer is semi-ok. It can be good for a laugh if you have friends in your own country to play with, otherwise, it runs like ass covered ass with a side of ass, and honestly, it's a big let down to the series as a whole. Still, if you played 1 and 2, play 3. If you haven't played 1 and 2, don't bother, save yourself the disappointment.",7,2013-10-10,PC,user
Nimbus1701,"Bioware promised too much with Mass Effect 3, and delivered an average shooter that was on-par with DeadSpace3. This is not an atrocious game. It's just average. Mass Effect 3's biggest problem is Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2. If this were a standalone production with a modular story I can imagine people would be more understanding. It had a lot to live up to but Bioware knew it didn't need to create a brilliant game to get the sales. In contrast to Mass Effect 2's cinematic rendered custscenes, ME3 only offers in-game cutscenes. The most notable problem in the character models are the eyes most human characters have a lifeless stare and feel like animated mannqueins. Environment and alien characters are however, very good. Combat is a tad nauseating at the start. It plays like DeadSpace, and differently to the previous two games. Many will feel that they're missing 40% of their screen to the large OTS-Character model. Ironically, one of the most contrversial features of the game, the ""optional"" multiplayer component, turns out to be better than expected. It may be annoying at the start, but you find yourself enjoying it more than the campaign storyline. I won't need to discuss the ""endings"" and the ""choice"" personally I found these issues to be secondary and would have been forgivable if I wasn't playing a rendition of Deadspace. It's difficult to understand why so many reviewers have marked this up in the 80s. It's definitely a reasonable shooter but not one for the books.",6,2013-10-05,PC,user
Pantheon,"Luckily this is a very small sample size of the people out there who have purchased/played ME3 because the rating is ridiculous. The game is nowhere near as bad as some people have made it out to be and the idea that someone can give it a 0 or a 1 or 2 is quite absurd (giving it a 10 might be just as absurd). I have a feeling that the people who so liberally hand out these low ratings do so for most every game they play. Now I played this AFTER the release of the extended cut, so in that light I'll say the following: The ending(s) made sense. A lot of the criticisms directed at the game because of the ending are borne from erroneous assumptions the various results of which were more dependent on your final effective military score than the actual choice you made, although obviously each choice resulted in some different outcomes for squad mates, people and the universe short term. Now for what I didn't like. 1) The game is still buggy, even over a year after its release. Origin let's you download a game that isn't even patched, so if you buy the game make sure you find the last patch for it this way you will avoid some of the bugs. I should note that EA/Origin ""help"" even missed this fact when called upon to resolve certain issues. 2) You almost have to play multiplayer in order to get the ""so-called"" best ending. I say multiplayer should never have an effect on single player. 3) Shepard still runs on 2 legs like an Ape and is about as graceful as an elephant, that violates my aesthetic appreciation of the game. More importantly though, ""movement"" around the playing field is clunky at best. 4) Side quests are truly uninspiring and the whole ""scan the planet"" to find an artifact is pretty lame. 5) Dialogue in general isn't quite as good as the ME1 or ME2, but not that bad. AND 6) Too many scripted cinematic events and Shepard is sometimes limited in response (and possibly out of character depending on YOUR Shepard. There are of course other issues (some involving Origin policies, etc.), but the total sum of all these issues (including those listed above) don't detract TOO heavily from the story/experience. It's still a fun ride and I give it a solid 8. Would have liked to give it a 9, but won't in deference to ME1 and ME2 but I suspect that's almost always the case with sequels to real good games, it's tough to surpass them as the novelty of their created universe wears off and expectations regarding how things should be and how things should be ""ended"" grow with each passing act/installment.",8,2013-10-05,PC,user
Isengrim,"Disappointment, is the word I would sum this game up with. Mass Effect 3, being a last game in a ME trilogy abandons most of the things that made Mass Effect 1 or 2 so successful. The story of this game, revolving around a mysterious alien device nobody knows anything about is full of plotholes and irrationalities. The gameplay is an improved version of Mass Effect 2, which still abandons most of RPG qualities as it's predecessor did. If that wasn't bad enough, Bioware decided to strip the player out of choices and if there is any they consequences are very similar making the choice itself meaningless. The characters and the world respond to every dialogue option in a very similar way making the whole Paragon/Renegade morality system totally worthless. While a player can import a save from the Mass Effect 2, he/she have to be aware that it doesn't make much of a difference, as possibly dead characters from Mass Effect 2 are replaced on the spot with another new/old character without any noteworthy consequence. There is no choice which mission you want to do, unlike in Mass Effect 1/2, here you just jump from one main mission to the other, linearly going forward to maybe the most disappointing ending in history of videogames. Bad writing, lack of logic, lack of choices and consequences means that this game isn't what it is advertised to be. Add annoying control scheme on PC and you have one of the worst game I have ever played and certainly the most disappointing one. Only redeeming quality of this game is it's soundtrack. Overall, 2/10 stay away.",2,2013-09-28,PC,user

Supernova722,"I'm not go to sit here and tell you Mass Effect 3 is perfect. I won't sit back in my chair and explain how it ""Doesn't follow a storyline."" Spoiler yes it does, as with Mass Effect 2, discussion you made all the way back in Mass Effect come into play. This is whole heartedly Mass Effect. Now dos the Arrival DLC give some crap intro to the next game? Yes. Does it matter that they wanted to explain it at all and release several online and magazine based articles detailing the events for those who didn't want to play? Also yes. They wanted to take the intense Third Person shooting that we saw in Mass Effect 2 and the more heavily driven RPG that we saw in Mass Effect, they then added meaningful weapon customization, upgraded cover, armor, and shield elements, and spiked the difficult. After playing ME3 on hardcore ME2 insanity was a picnic. But then we come to the elephant in the room. What about the endings? Are all those who felt betrayed be an ending 5 years old. I didn't have one problem with how they did the ending. They we trying to be artful and mysterious much like Kubrick in the movies. In fact movies have several examples of why you don't need to see every little detail. Do I like the new endings, yes. Well now for the outrange that was a relatively good (maybe great) horde mode multiplayer. I got 4500 force because I made go choices in the other 2 games. I still went through the multiplayer because it was fun, do you need to micro purchase. Well do you need to make them in any other multiplayer. It's not just EA every major multiplayer has come out with something like this so you can not and may not fault them. And now I come to the part where I get to be an mean. I don't know when you preordered your copies... but my collector editions were reserved for 9 months. I was one of the first if not the first to Pre-order the collector's edition from GameStop.

Unfortunately, EA has announced that it has no intention of supporting future RPGs that don't involve micro-transactions, so there may be more dark days ahead. ME3 is, however, a decent cover-based shooter. It certainly has more characterization than most shooters, which is nice. That is small consolation for RPG fans, who have plenty of options in the over-saturated shooter market, if that is what they wanted to play (it isn't).

But after adding the extended cut, (which if nothing else tries to help things) and playing it through with readjusted expectations as part of the trilogy, I have come to love 90% of it. Visually it is superb, the overall story keeps you engaged and the characters you know and love don't disappoint. My only gropes are: (The ending, but as I have already said I can live with it with a little help from my post story imagination) The lack of tactical choices; I wanted Shepard to control the Normandy in fleet battles and make big decisions on how to roll out the battle. And fire that awesome cannon!! :D The multiplayer element, which although is very good in its own right, should not impact at all on the single player.

Ruston,"To be **** my opinion...Mass Effect 3 isn't worse than 1 or 2. All games of Mass Effect's Trilogy are on the same level. I must say I didn't feel dissapointed playing this game, I was having fun since the first action to the last one. I can't understand why there are so many negative opinions. The main plot is nothing special but it's still good. Don't forget there are secondary missions which are just the cherry on the cake. ""Terrible writing"" I don't agree. For sure the best one is in Mass Effect 1 but we can't ignore this game because of it. Graphics Really Why we must care about it so hard... Anyway it doesn't look so bad and I am sure it's gonna be better in the next one. I am just worried about the fact ""Shepard Era"" is over. That's the only 1 thing which can hurts..

Gothic90,"Due to length constraint, I'll just talk about a few non-ending problems I have with ME3. I still don't think EC writes a good ending, because Bioware tries to use the ending purely to make a point about human vs machines, rather than make an ending to a story. Problems are here. 1) Horrible controls. 5 conflicting functions bound to the same space bar. Especially frustrating in multiplayer. 2) A large number of boring fetch quests as side quests, with unhelpful quest entries that have no progress indications. 3) The so called return of RPG elements. Turns out to be looking for upgrades scattered everywhere. I am okay with both ME1's loot and ME2's lack of RPG elements, but this is garbage. 4) Stereotypes, stereotypes everywhere. Suddenly there are stereotypical stereotypical weak and annoying Asian, and a football jock and etc. To appeal to the masses? Seriously? 5) A lot of miscellaneous things that I would find quite repulsive. Like they purposely put them there just to disgust people. Other than that ME3 is fine.

Littlefield,"The issue I have with all the low ratings... is they're by people who don't understand RPGs. RPGs are NOT about the end-game. They are irrefutably about the journey. So, when you're rating an RPG you need to view it differently compared to a cut and dry shooter, with that being said, the journey through Mass Effect 3 is unforgettable in my eyes. It brought closure to MANY issues in the mass effect universe. The story has some weak points, that's undeniable, but when the game is at a high-point it's almost unrivaled. Now that leads us to the ending... I will be completely honest, the 2 points that I deducted from this game, came solely from the ending. It is one of the WEAKEST endings to a video game series I have ever seen. The extended cut ending, fixes some issues, but not all, and still leaves more to be desired. The ending was unsatisfying, and left a bad taste in a lot of gamers mouths. With that being said, I feel as though they're options were somewhat limited as far as the ending goes, the trilogy built it up to a point where there was simply nowhere to go from where they were, and it caused the ending to come across as flimsy, unsatisfying, and somewhat disappointing. All in all, the game is NOT a bad game, and if you like the Mass Effect universe, get the game, play it, and enjoy it. The story is great throughout, game play is improved upon, much smoother, and contains some pretty difficult choices regarding your squad mates, and the galaxy as a whole.

I don't understand the bias of some people here, you can't just low-grade spam reviews for a game just cause you don't like the ending.

And ME 3 is great in every possible aspect, let's get that clear for start. It is improved compared to ME 2 in a lot of ways, gameplay, graphics, you name it. There is lot more diversity between classes, when you play a class it actually feels like your playing that certain class, unlike ME1, where every class was just a different mix of same abilities.

This was a stellar sequel and all the ones and twos out of 10 are just immature. As a long time gamer I'm used to disappointing endings; its a common weakness in video game storytelling.

NestLols,"Mass effect 3 is a fitting conclusion to the mass effect saga. It boasts significantly improved gameplay fluidity and mechanics, as well as a more varied campaign. The story is emotional, hard hitting, and diverse. The games visuals have been improved a lot, and the pc version looks quite spectacular despite and aging core engine, and runs smoother than the previous games to boot. In terms of streamlining which I hate the game is in between mass effect 1 and 2, the major disappointment in the game is the planet exploring, which has been stripped down. Imported save games determine a lot, from entire characters no longer existing in the story to conflicts that play out entirely different.Multiplayer is fun, and is not required to get the best ending in the game. In the end, mass effect 3 is special. As good as mass effect 2 in storytelling, and almost as good as mass effect 1 in rpg-like skill/item medications and exp distribution.

Aetohatir,"First off I'd like to tell you from where I come I finished all the games mutiple times and I read the three first books. I know all about the indoctrination theory and any other fan fiction ending. I gave the other two games both a perfect rating although they had big flaws because I am very keen to the mass effect universe. I must agree to the general opinion ME3 is BY FAR the worst of all Mass effect games though it has its strengths and this game definatly is not a 4.8 Yes the Ending is bad and I dont understand why they even wanted to change it. If people want to spoil them selves they shouldnt have read the leak originated on neoGAF. Anyway It was nice to dive back in to the ME universe once more even though the story line of the game wasnt all that good even though you were able to port your old ME2 save into ME3 this didnt matter at all. Bioware just went with it that the player played all the ME2 DLC which is not always the case. the war rating had NO influence at all and yes the endings.. well you know the backslash The game had its good parts though too. The Soundtrack again was alsolutely superb following the more orchestral style of ME2. Visuals also were better than the other two games, and well the gameplay went a long way butis now actually playable as a cover based shooter. Or at least to big titles like Gears of War not an absolute catastrophy anymore. I absolutely recoment the first two mass effect games and if you enjoyed those you will at least want to play the third one. And this what it comes down to: This is not the grand finale we hoped for but it still is the finale and even though I cannot understand Bioware not just putting the Indoctrination theory slyly into the game via free DLC and makeing the recond straight once again we are stuck with what we have. The Multiplayer is fun to a certain extend, I played it about 20 hours but the micro transactions bug me still had a lot of fun with a friend in that mode. This is not a trrible game. And its not a bad game its just mediocre. the fault of the game failing so badly in compairsm with the first two you might push to EA, or to Bioware itself it still is worth while, but I wouldnt spend anythjing above 25€ on it. 6/10",6,2013-07-24,PC,user

It was like the developers completely forgot about the fact that all of the games are based around choice, but the ending betrays that fact. All three endings are incredibly similar, which made us feel as if our choices never mattered in the first place. I love the Mass Effect games but the ending of this game just brought it down.

Vonnd,"I played this game a long time ago but just decided to come back and reflect. I thought the gameplay was good. But the best thing about this game was the atmosphere. It felt crushing at all times. I felt that there was no time and all would be lost, so I had to try something. I could really get into the mood of this game and I thought the ending reflected ME3's atmosphere as a whole perfectly. I think this game has had one of the best storylines in a game yet. The most important thing to me was the music combined with the few glimpses of light and hope spending time with those close to the protagonist. This game shows to me how creating a coherent structure for atmosphere can make for a unique, amazing and touching experience. I understand that this came at a cost of some features, but I still loved it. I also felt the game series had matured to beyond the black and white. I understand that the younger audience might find this annoying. I loved it. Finding an answer to all the questions after all that, would've been the definition of anticlimax.

SourHyperion1,"After hearing a lot about how Mass Effect 3 fell short of Mass Effect 2, I came in expecting something totally different than it delivered and in the best way. Mass Effect 3 picks up a bit after the events of Mass Effect 2 concluded. Shepard has somehow got himself free from Cerberus and grounded on Earth by the Alliance. Mass Effect 3 shows how dark the series can get allowing for the series to end very strongly. Gameplay: The game has updated its style, mainly when on a mission. The cover system has dramatically improved and both armor variation and the number of weapons has dramatically increased. The AI does get caught up quite a bit and this can lead to wasting a lot of medigel, but you can at least run over and help them up without the use of it. Most of the other mechanics of the game are the same, but missions now impact how ready your forces are to fight the reapers, which I thought was an excellent addition similar to that of Fable 3's, but much much better. There is also the improved scanning system where you just scan from the galaxy map, but in some systems this will alert the reapers. Graphics: Mass Effect 3 has gotten a bit of a face lift allows for more detail in almost everything and it looks brilliant. While the graphics are not the best, I don't think I've seen such a beautiful Sci-fi RPG to date. Story: The campaign takes Shepard to the far reaches of the galaxy, but sadly not all of it. I went on quite a few side missions and I never felt that I went as far as I could have. However, this is made up with some of the incredibly painful decisions you are forced to make. Most of those decisions are toward the end, but they will make you second guess yourself and even regret them. Then comes the infamous ending, which I thought was probably one of the most dramatic and depressing endings to a trilogy I have experienced. No spoilers, but if you were expecting a happily ever after, you will be disappointed and or surprised. I'm not quite sure why this game has received such bad reviews, I have played the entire trilogy through and I feel that each game brought something new and exciting to the table and Mass Effect 3 was no exception. You will not find an experience equal to that of this trilogy and if you are on the fence as to whether or not to buy it, go buy it and enjoy the many hours of brilliance it will give you.",9,2013-07-12,PC,user
Syrius00,"This game, well, is the conclusion of an incredible journey. All the Bioware team made a great work, overall. The game features great graphics and a captivating storytelling (even if the best one is in the second chapter IMHO). It is so fast paced that it can be exhausting at high difficulties. The finals, this time, are FINALS and even if they may leave you with disappointment (or tears, like my case) are original and EPIC. Multiplayer is OK, but I would definitely exchange it for more ""single player"". So, why nine? Actually, I would have liked to give a 8.5, but 9 is for the excellent references and the emotions I felt while playing. Anyway the game is a bit buggy now and then and some things seem to have been completed in a hurry. Anyway this won't ruin the experience at all. Want the best experience? Buy all the trilogy and ""grow up"" your Shepard. For me has been the best non-real experience of my life till now. Keelah se'lai!",9,2013-07-11,PC,user
WookieChestHair,"I can completely understand where people are coming from when they say they hated this game because of it's ending and whatnot, but what you can't ignore is the fact that until that point, the game was incredible. Seeing the characters from that past two games and even having a couple of them join your crew again brings great feelings of nostalgia and while I admit, the 'space bar to do everything' concept was quite poor, the reason I play Mass Effect was for the intricate storyline and the lovable characters, not the gameplay. The basic cover shooting mechanics and the games ending stopped this from getting a 10, but, in my opinion, it's still one of the greatest gaming series of all time, and I can't wait to see what Bioware gives us with the next instalment.",7,2013-07-05,PC,user
Floxer,"Mass Effect 3 (2012) Mass Effect 3 ist ein Science Fiction/Action Rollenspiel. Es ist die Fortsetzung und der Abschluss der Mass Effect Trilogie. Wie bereits sein Vorgänger, basiert das Spiel auf der Unreal-Engine 3 und wurde ebenfalls von BioWare (Baldur's Gate, Dragon Age) entwickelt. Der Publisher ist Electroic Arts. Das Spiel wird wieder aus der dritten Person gesteuert, sodass man einen guten Überblick über das Schlachtfeld hat und die Gestaltung der Spielfigur direkt erkennen kann. Die Spieldauer beträgt ca. 40 Stunden. Nachdem im ersten Teil ein abtrünniger Spectre (sowas wie Geheimpolizei mit unbeschränkten Befugnissen) namens Saren aufgehalten wurde, eine Reaper-Invasion zu initiieren (Reaper Maschinenvolk mit der Absicht alles Leben auszulöschen) und im zweiten Teil die Bedrohung der Kollektoren (von Reapern indoktrinierte Spezies) neutralisiert wurde, konnte es das Maschinenvolk nun doch schaffen in die Sonnensysteme der Völker der galaktischen Allianz einzudringen. Als Commander Shepard sieht man nun erneut der Gefahr ins Auge, einer gewaltigen Übermacht gegenüber zu stehen, die alles einsetzten, um das Leben in der Galaxie auszulöschen. Zusammen mit altbekannten Charakteren aus Mass Effect 1, sind die Völker der Allianz zu vereinen um den Reapern eine finale Endschlacht zu bieten. Dabei trifft man des Öfteren auch auf alte Bekannte aus dem zweiten Teil der Trilogie, die einem Aufträge anbieten und Unterstützung im Kampf gegen die Reaper zusichern. Durch die Möglichkeit Spielstände aus den vorher gespielten Teilen der Trilogie zu importieren, kann der Verlauf der Story sich ändern, da z.B. einige alte Crew-Mitglieder nicht überlebt haben oder Entscheidungen anders getroffen wurden als die Standardeinstellungen eines neuen Spielstandes es darstellen würden. Das Spielgeschehen kann maßgeblich beeinflusst werden durch eine Vielzahl verschiedener Entscheidungsmöglichkeiten, die den Spieler stellenweise mit z.B. ethnischen und moralischen Fragen konfrontiert. Durch ein ""Gesinnungssystem"" kann man so zu einem rücksichtslosen Tyrannen oder aber zu einem hilfsbereiten Helden werden. Zusätzlich bietet das Spiel die Möglichkeit sowohl als männlicher als auch weiblicher Charakter das Geschehen zu erleben. Dies verändert ebenfalls das Verhalten der Crew-Mitglieder. Der Wiederspielwert des Spiels ist also enorm. Durch weitere DLC's (Downloadable Content) erweitert sich die Story. Jedoch sind einige dieser Erweiterungen mit Kosten verbunden, bieten aber dementsprechend auch mehr Inhalt. Alles in allem übertrifft dieses Spiel trotz Neuerungen im Kampfsystem nicht die Vorgänger, zieht jedoch auf Augenhöhe. Für Mass Effect Veteranen ein Muss. Science Fiction Liebhaber und Rollenspiel Fans werden auch voll auf ihre Kosten kommen.",9,2013-07-05,PC,user
cappugino,Repetitive game! After 3-4 hours playing the game is going to get boring. Bad and boring K.I. and sometimes unfair difficulty. Only for fans! For people who never played such games its wasted money.,2,2013-07-03,PC,user
Tecco,"Best Game series out there, great story and better and better gameplay for each game that tops in Mass Effect 3 Abilities on different carracters that can be used in combination with each others, gameplay that makes you want to play just to play. A awesome story with characters you build a great personal relationship to, great laughs and great sorrows, that makes you go 35-45hours straight skipping work/school and forgetting to eat and sleep. Sadly people cant seem to review the game as a whole and focus on the ending that could be better, but even with the endings there is very little to put a finger on as a whole. Still it not even that bad a ending, just not how people want it to end making them butthurt, that they dont get a sugar sweet ending. I read trough afew critics in the ""red"" and alot of the stuff i just cant reconize from my playtroughs. Some state the exact opposite(Lies? but why?) of how the game works, some state the character acting and story is bad, even though i think both tops even the top end movies we have on the market today. This game made me play the ME1 and ME2 several times over to get the different coices and i have 5-7 playtroughs of the ME3 game itself, and besides that the surprisingly good Multiplayer i used a good 1000hours om itself. This game has been worth every penny!",10,2013-07-03,PC,user

In fact this series the one of the GREATEST GAME TRILOGIES ever made.Please don't undervalue this game just because the game didn't end the way you wanted(No Offense).",10,2013-07-02,PC,user
Turk,"After the dust had settled and the brutal ""star child"" wars have been waged, I returned to ME3, and it still serves as the definitively example of how to disappoint on all levels. This game must have been designed to be a blockbuster with all those troublesome expenses related to quality cut out. The depth of the universe is gone, replaced by petty 3rd party dialogue microcosms that read like bad soap operas. The gameplay is as simplistic and vapid as the ending- even the hardest levels offer only random chance as a mechanic rather than strategy. Level design, if you can even call it that, is reduced to a corridor with walls to hide behind. If you are on a planet there is a nice background of a vibrant world that you will by no means be able to interact with ever- kind of a final ""f-you"" from EA. There is more, so much more, but I'm getting tired and my love of the first two games can only create so much antipathy towards this one.",4,2013-07-01,PC,user
Rennn,"Another masterpiece from Bioware. First, I've never played the game without the free Extended Cut DLC, which alters the endings. Keep that it in mind. From what I'm told, the original endings were horrible, but they're not bad with the EC DLC. Many of the complaints are just NOT true. Characters do not randomly die. I imported a save which I'd used in both ME1 and ME2, and all of my choices mattered. Mordin lived, Tali lived, Garrus lived. Liara lived, and I was ecstatic to notice that she's back as a permanent companion in ME3, because she was my romance interest in ME1 and ME2. Everyone relevant lived. I even got the Geth and Quarians working together... I guess I don't understand the negative reviews for ME3. If you make too many mistakes you'll get everyone killed and be a sad kitty, but if you put some time into the series (all 3 games) your choices really accumulate and you can save virtually everyone. The reapers are a galaxy-destroying terror. Yes, it's hard to get the good ending and requires a lot of effort on the players part. You will need to play all three games and get everyone working together. You'll need to mediate disputes between your companions, and you'll need to earn massive amounts of loyalty if you want to survive the reaper onslaught. It wouldn't make sense any other way. Maybe modern gamers don't typically understand this, but an epic victory means way more if it's difficult to achieve. The reapers are powerful... It takes a very skilled and diplomatic player to defeat them without your friends dying in the process. it's sad to see an amazing game like Mass Effect 3 get bashed simply because players weren't willing to put in the effort to save their favorite companions.",10,2013-06-27,PC,user

Lynnux,"Obviously the parallel development of Star Wars: The Old Republic took a toll on both games. ME 3 seems to be hastily assembled to finish the series in the given time frame. The ending strongly reminds me of another game series of the Cyberpunk genre which I also like. But this ending style is imho not fitting to the ME series. The last two missions felt right out of place. But face it: these are the most the negative points of the third part. ME3 is still clearly above average and is never worse than a 7.0. No way Sorry, just because you've expected a happy end doesn't make the whole game bad. The ""Galaxy at War"" mechanics is simply brilliant. It allows all your deeds of the three parts and two additional games, the cooperative multiplayer (included in ME3) and the mobile app ""Infiltrator"" to be integrated and add to your effort to save the galaxy. And don't believe everything you read here. E.g. multiplayer is not necessary at all to get the best endings but you need a pretty good score which is maybe not possible if you killed everything and everyone possible in the first two parts ;-p You'll just feel the consequences of your previous actions. And this is clearly a benefit of this game series which also contributes to ME3. My advice to all players who gave a score below 5: play the ME series a second time and you'll see the game a little bit differently.",7,2013-06-25,PC,user
braeden,"Again, the user score is more than unfair. Mass Effect 3 is a good game, but it just doesn't live up to the expectations people had after the second part. The main problem with Mass Effect 3 is the storytelling which builds up to whole lot of nothing. And with this, I don't mean just the ending which is unsatisfying to say the least. The whole coming back to Earth part seams rushed after spending the whole game preparing for it. Also one of the main elements of the game, collecting war resources, seems to affect nothing in the end (maybe some cinematic is slightly altered). Overall gaming experience is also not quite as immersive as with Mass Effect 2. On several occasions, I couldn't help the feeling that I was just running around completing some random tasks to get to the next place. Also NPC characters didn't feel quite as deep as in Mass Effect 2. However, compared to storytelling these are very minor issues and the overall gaming experience was still very good. It's hard to say if this game can be recommended or not. Basically everything, except the storytelling, is done as it should or better. However, one of the worst things game can do is leave players unsatisfied at the end. Thus I wouldn't at least wait some kind of bargain before considering buying this.",8,2013-06-25,PC,user
Smartchoy,"Such a disappointing end to a series. The problem with the ending is simply that it such a waste of opportunity. If Bioware wanted whatever ending is their decision but they don't really go through it, no funeral, no wedding, no epilogue, just laziness, just nonsense. FFXII opens with a great wedding and a funeral in its opening animation, I don't care if its happy or sad, I just wish to enjoy the feelings, I am paying for this. Mass effect 3 had the perfect opportunity to make you feel so much, you have been playing so long with this crew, a reunion, or funeral, or big closure would have made me feel so much, but is just a big ""thank you for playing, but we wont say what happened, bye""",1,2013-06-24,PC,user

EliteAmatuer,"Mass Effect 3 is a good, good, good game. Yes, the part of the ending with the child makes no sense (not to spoil-y I hope). But other than that, Mass Effect 3 is a great accomplishment in gaming. With ME 3, Bioware found a good balance between action and RPG elements. For RPG fans, there is a long list of skill trees to mess around with and weapon modification to match your gameplay style. They removed the class limitation on weapons and simply let you choose which of the pistols and rifles you want to use. All of the powers have been balanced so that all classes are equally viable on the hardest difficulties. All in all gameplay has been greatly improved from ME 2. The story is still great. You have less squad members than ME2 but they are more fleshed out. If you haven't played the first two games a lot of the story might be lost on you but for people have played both ME1 and ME2 in order, ME 3 finishes up the Story arcs of each character(s) in a beautiful and cathartic way. You have a lot of influence and involvement with how the stories end which increase the player's investment in the game. I plead with you, dear reader, ignore the bad user reviews and give this game a chance.",9,2013-06-20,PC,user
Toffenuff,"I cannot, in good conscience, give this game any lower than a 6 because up until the ending the game was superb and truly enjoyable for me. It's epic to gather the fleets of the universe together and to warp into battle like they do in the ending portion of the game. It builds upon the (in my opinion) great and enjoyable gameplay of ME2, and as usual the graphics are beautiful. Splendid voice acting bring each character to life and the relationships and character development are all there. One of the best things about the ME series and Bioware is their whole, ""what you did in the previous game impacts this game"" and while there's still a cop out in some aspects that some of the things you did only are acknowledged or shown in a minor way, I think that's still impressive enough that it makes you feel you have truly impacted this universe beyond simply completing the missions. You've made choices, and those choices have had consequences. One thing I wish they had added was the ability to control real control of the Normandy and have some space maneuvering (as in simulation, not the Galaxy Map) and more importantly, space battles! Amazing game, but horrendous ending that was only partial fixed by the DLC. Would've given this game a 9 were it not for the ending. After dozens of hours of gameplay through various replays of each game to test different combinations of choices... how could you end the game like that? It was just... devastatingly disappointing.",6,2013-06-19,PC,user
Fallrim,"We really do need to stop rating this game on its ending. Let's be fair to Bioware, they had a damn difficult task giving us a fitting, satisfying conclusion to a goddamn fantastic franchise, and for the most part, they achieved it. Let's get the positive stuff done first. The game has much improved combat, and the voice acting, dialogue and story (for the most part) are as hard hitting as before, with several emotional scenes being some of the best character endings I have witnessed. The games inclusion of multiplayer should really have been story co-op, but the horde, co-op mode serves as a nice distraction for when you tire of the core game. The music is good as ever, and the graphics have improved. The game does a good job of getting the atmosphere of all out war right, and it feels like the universe is fighting the reapers. Now for the bad stuff. Before we address the ending, there were other things wrong with this game. Some idiot at Bioware for some reason decided to remove mission tracking in journal entries, so we never know how far we are in a certain mission! There does feel like a bit of Michael Bay EXPLOSIONS EVERYWHERE action going off here, but despite this it would have been nicer to see all out battles going on rather than linear small skirmishes. Now, the ending. Yes, it was bad. It was an A, B, or C option like we were explicitly promised would not happen. And yes, it had many plot holes and felt irritating and out of character for Shepherd to go along with it. But honestly, just because 20 minutes of the game was bad, it does not mean the whole game was bad.",8,2013-06-15,PC,user
dam1730,"First of all, the user score for this game is in no way indicative of the quality of this game. Mass Effect games are very different in the world of gaming as they are a hybrid of several different genres. Obviously Mass Effect games are RPGs, but they also incorporate FPS, adventure, and even strategy elements all into one game. The best part of the Mass Effect series is that you get to know the characters well. Whether you like the character or not, you know them very well by the end of the series and become connected to some of them. Another great thing about the series is that every player has their own Shepard that they can come to identify with as well. Their are many things that I like in ME3 when compared to the other games in the series. First of all, the graphics look much better, especially in gameplay itself. The storyline is pretty good. If you've played the first two games of the series, you could probably predict some of what was going to happen, but after putting at least 50-60 hours into the first 2 games, this is probably to be expected since you knew this was the final entry of the trilogy. As far as combat goes, as with the other games, it can be as difficult or as easy as you want it to be. I've found different classes to be much easier to play because certain enemies are overly strong at the higher difficulty levels and certain classes make it much easier to defeat those particular enemies. The decisions of this game are heavily influenced by past actions, much more so than ME2 as ME1 and ME2 actions both have a large effect on decisions in this game. A lot of controversy surrounded the ending of this game, and it did certainly deserve some controversy, as when I first finished the game I sat and stared at the screen for 5 minutes in disbelief. I do encourage every player to look into the ending more, there's a lot of stuff out there which is interesting. For example, I find ""indoctrination theory"" to be a good explanation. The amount of emotion that this ending caused shows the amount of passion that this series creates. I really believe this series is a must play for anyone who likes games because I think it has a little something for everyone. This game is not perfect, if the ending were better if would be close. I give this game an 8.5, but it will show up as a 9. Lot's of angry people reviewed the game two seconds after they finished it and were upset. There are also people who fell in love with the original game and don't like how 2 and 3 play. ME1 is very different, and ME2 and ME3 are similar but with slight differences.",9,2013-06-14,PC,user
Bestpony,"There's a whole litany of problems with ME3 and, well, just look at the user score here. That disastrous ending will be remembered 10 years from now (and the Extended Cut DLC doesn't really help), the writing is very uneven, the facial animations are almost nonexistent, the journal is next to useless, and then there's that dreadful business with day 1 DLC adding a character that is essential to the story and yet ends up being rather boring. And you know what? None of that matters all that much because ME3 still completely delivers on its promise of bringing an end to an epic story and doing so via a tight and very fun to play rpg/shooter game. You meet a ton of old friends (in fact, you meet pretty much everyone from the previous two games), you make some new ones (Vega, Cortez, and Traynor are all great and quite down-to-earth compared to the crazy suicide squad in ME2), there are memorable battles, tough choices, historic events, tragic sacrifices... pretty much everything I wanted from a Mass Effect game. It's a rushed product, made by a team that was obviously tired and wanted to be done with it as quickly as possible, which is unfortunate, but at the end of the day, it's a powerful conclusion to a great trilogy.",8,2013-06-07,PC,user

It also doesn't provide much direction at the beginning, so if you play without using a wiki (like I did) you can miss out on a lot of content that I would have liked to play. That said, I have no other complaints about this game. While you don't get as many squad members, you can still develop meaningful relationships with them throughout the game. The world is fantastic. I'm probably going to be crucified for this, but I think the Mass Effect story/universe is superior to both Star Wars and Star Trek.

obscurus166,"Mass Effect 3 is a basically decent game which is irretrievably spoiled by oversimplification and lack of dramatic direction. The game looks marvellous, but, as with many Bioware games, the locations are Potemkin villages: Shepard and her squadmates are restricted in their movements, hemmed in on all sides in small arenas with convenient chest-high walls, with no potential for interaction with the scenery. Combat largely handles well, but never strays from the mould of ""cover-based shooter."" The lack of any real challenge from the enemies discourages tactical thinking and the awkward use of the ""F"" key as a melee button makes the use of melee an unrealistic option on the PC. What is particularly frustrating about this game is how the stripped-down interface divests the gamer's experience of any verve or life. So many of the side missions are no more sophisticated than a text-based DOS game. When exploring a planet to find resources for the war, a player is simply told that he had recovered something of use, but there is no game-driven, interactive imperative to treat those text notifications with anything other than apathy. The ""Citadel"" DLC adds some welcome opportunity for character interaction and development, but really ought to have been part of the original game I can only imagine how shallow and unsatisfying ME3 would have been without it. The ending of Mass Effect 3 has attracted opprobrium quite rightly. Labouring hard over the course of three games to save squadmates, or entire species, has little or no dramatic payoff. The destinies of squad-mates and their unusual pairings are left ignored and untold. The narrative justification of the final denouement is weak and unsatisfactory, and somewhat contradicts established canon. This is particularly disappointing when the stripped-down, simplified gameplay mechanic runs the player on rails towards the choice of four such unsatisfying conclusions. For all those gripes, there is some fun to be had here, but ME3 deserves to be remembered most for squandered opportunities.",6,2013-05-11,PC,user

dumle,Mass effect 3 disappoints in several important aspects. The writing in the game is extremely uneven which really drags a game like this down. Sure there are some cool moments here and there but the story is overall really weak and the game is full of awkward and cheaply written moments. And it doesnt help that the conversation wheel is dumbed down too the absurd. The dialogue options are extremely binary and quite often they lead to the same result. The only difference is whether you get some paragon or renegade points in the end. And when you do get to make an important choice then the dialogue wheels poorly explained choices in simply not enough. The renegade/paragon options in the cutscenes also feels really cheap since you have no idea what kind of choice you are making. Overall the game lacks the kind of interaction you would expect from a roleplaying game and the games mission-design feel extremely linear and more like an action game than a roleplaying game. Another thing worth mentioning is that this game is much more combat oriented than previous games in the series. There are very few hub-based areas in the game and you will spend the majority of your time in combat missions. Now the combat is quite good for a roleplaying game. For an action game however the combat is extremely average. The combat is a pretty basic cover-mechanic based shooter with the normal peak-shoot-duck and wait for the shield to recharge type of gameplay. It is by no means a catastrophe but it simply cant carry an entire long game like this. And chances are that you will get bored of the combat before beating this game which is a shame since that is what you are going to spend your time doing. The focus on combat sadly also mean that a lot of the environments you are in are nothing more than boring grey/brown ruins which is kind of sad since there is a lot of cool places to the explore in the universe. You do thankfully also get to visit some pretty neat places in the game which is nice. The exploration in the game do however leave a lot of things to be desired. The maps are often extremely linear and the lack of side quest and stuff to find leads to you not feeling the need to explore. I should also note that both the item and enemy variety is quite limited which i really thought hurt the game. I believe that the limited enemy variety is particularly sad since games like this can make up all kinds of cool faunas and cultures to fight. You are sadly forced to fight the same quite boring enemies over and over again which doesn't really help the combat. The visuals are for the most part alright but there are some low-res textures in the game here and there that just look awful by contrast. I also have issues with the weird camera angel they have chosen for the game. Something you cant fix in the extremely basic options menu. Now despite being quite critical of the game i must mention that the game is by no means so bad that some people make it out to be. I would say that its extremely average. The game have a long list of flaws but it also have a decent amount of alright content in it. I picked it up for a cheap price and i dont regret doing that despite the games flaws. if you however go into this game expecting a traditional bioware rpg or a worthy continuation of the mass effect saga then chances are that you will be disappointed. I should also mention that the were some quite shady dlc practices involved with this game. But you should try to make up your own mind regarding that.,5,2013-04-30,PC,user
mckw,"Apart from the ending, let us not forget that it is still a great experience, I may have many gripes but I still had a fun and enjoyable time with this game. It does hit the high tension mark at times but ultimately it is a step back or two from the previous game. With smaller team roster and less interesting back stories to them (except Legion's which was pretty BA). The quest system is just bad and was really overlooked by developers, though I do prefer the scanning in this game compared to searching for ores in the previous game. Overall the experience of this franchise is a 10/10, however the end leaves you wanting and very disappointing.",8,2013-04-29,PC,user

silverwolf12711,"I know many people are very angry at this game, and I understand that. Mass Effect 3 is just as much a step backward as a step forward from the previous iterations of the series. ME3 is much more action-oriented than the previous two games, something which I don't mind, There are more weapons in each category, and each class can now use every weapon. For me this opened up new gameplay possibilities. I could be a sentinel with a sniper rifle, a shotgun-wielding adept or engineer. While I like some of the new combat changes, the loss of RPG elements annoys me. Shepard can still pick his/her squad, but now there are only 6 squad members to chose from, 7 if you bought the DAY-ONE dlc, as opposed to the 11-12 there were in ME2. Loyalty mission are also gone, which takes away a personal element. Long-time fans of the series may be a bit disappointed by all this, but ME3 makes up for it in other ways. The Graphics are actually impressive, with nice lighting effects and great CGI space battles. These battles will be in great abundance, as now Shepard is facing the full force of the reaper onslaught against the galaxy. Shepard will have to unite the races of the galaxy, no easy task, to successfully fight off the reaper invasion and recapture earth. Choosing which races to side with, and some actions that Shepard chooses have an effect on and overall ""readiness"" bar which indicates military strength, and chances of victory in the final battle. Unfortunately, none of the other decisions Shepard has made throughout the other games will have ANY impact on the final ending. The end of the game feels rushed and lazy. For this i find that EA is probably to blame, rushing the game out ahead of schedule. An ending DLC does fix many of these issues, but leaves many unanswered. The fact that there even is an ending DLC to me shows that bioware cares for the universe it created, even if the messed up the first time around. Another good thing is that the awful mining mini games are **** be replaced with a less annoying, simpler, ""find stuff on planet to help you in the war effort"". One final thing that annoyed me about the gameplay was that instead of multiple factions and enemies, there are only three: Cerberus, reapers, and geth. This feels like another move away from more rpg elements to action elements. The AI is adequate; on higher difficulties some of the bigger enemies can be troublesome. Despite the changes, ME3 still feels like Mass Effect, a third person cover **** hybrid. Using Shepard's powers and squad mate's powers to effectively combat enemy strengths and weaknesses is something true fans of the series will find fun and familiar. The soundtrack is great, the characters still great, and the story only slightly less than what most expect from Mass Effect. Which brings me to the multiplayer. Many people were worried it would take over from the single player, but it doesn't, in fact, it provides a welcome distraction from the reaper attack. Multiplayer is a horde-based mode in which up to four players can fight against waves of enemies of different types as many different races and classes. Ever wanted to play as a quarian engineer? A drell assassin, turian soldier, or even Krogan and Geth? There are also scores of weapons, upgrades, and attachments available. So far all the MP DLCs have been free, but MP still feels like EA trying to make quick cash sometimes. Multiplayer can still be fun, though. All considered, Mass Effect 3 feels a slightly rushed ending to a series dear to many people's hearts. It is still a good, dun game, but lets down in many things fans have come to expect form Bioware and the series as a whole.",8,2013-04-28,PC,user
48Laws,"****/watch?v=gu731UtTFqo I wish I could have seen this before purchasing ME3. Personally, I was a loyal follower of the ME franchise since a year or so after the first game came out. I watched as a high-quality RPG turned into a fun storytelling-driven shooter hybrid. I enjoyed both of the first two games, but worried that Bioware may have been taking too many creative liberties with game play design. After DA2 became a malignant tumor on the whole DA franchise, I worried that marketing was steering video games toward a more obviously profit-driven path. I enjoyed seeing some of my favorite characters in ME3, but having the entire series to compare the game to I felt disappointed and wished I hadn't purchased it before it's price plummeted. The game screams linearity, entire plot lines promised to have wildly different conclusions were railroaded and some of the characters with strong convictions pulled a 180 in the (choo-choo) 6-month mandated shore leave Shep was put on after Arrival (whether or not it was even played). James Vega was chosen by Bioware, knowing fewer squad mates would be included in this game, to accommodate newer players and have someone dumber than them on the Normandy. 17% of your squad is new, has no clue what's going on, and was included solely for first-time players; It really sends a message to those who have played the game for 5+ years (notice Vega wasn't made DLC; he must have either been considered more 'essential' than a Prothean by the devs or EA thought nobody would buy it). A broken journal system ensures players will constantly be wondering whether they scanned the right section of space for an item or have yet to drop it off to the NPC on the citadel who's conversation Shep overheard (these are laughably called 'side missions'). After you're confused by wtf just happened after the endings, you can buy all the answers in DLC form for $10 in Leviathan. This game is complete rubbish without the answers in that DLC pack (and even so, the plot further devolves into a joke). What's worst of all for me: this game makes me feel embarrassed for all the recommendations I gave out for the series after ME1 and ME2. I know I've personally brought 6 friends into the Mass Effect world, and only one of them enjoyed the ""experience"" of ME3. The rest still joke about the endings over a year past the game's release, and according to much of the polling done the majority of the fan base feels the same way. After this debacle, I won't be making that mistake with Bioware products again.",4,2013-04-27,PC,user

The only people who don't think the ending is bad are the fan-boys or those with ADD who didn't pay attention to the story. The choices you make in the game do not affect the outcome of your ending. You get to the end and are presented with A, B, or C choice for an ending like Deus Ex did. On top of it the ending makes no sense, and contradicts itself.

nkaduthod,"As a beloved fan of the Mass Effect series, I was without a doubt quite disappointed with this game. While the game play is good and offers a more fluid experience, I fell that they dumbed the combat down to much. They also took away most of the RPG aspect of the game I loved. The story I felt was really lacking compared to ME1 & ME2. The new characters like Diane and James were very uninteresting and the graphics and animations have barely been touched since ME2. My decisions imported from the first two games didn't really impact the story and I feel like BioWare and EA were turning this game into a clone of Gears of War except in space. And what the is up with Day 1 DLC From Ashes? For a very important character relevant to the entire series and basically what it is based on? EA is obviously trying to pressure BioWare into making a more ""mass-appealing game"". No! Also, the quest system is complete and utter And what happened to my narrative structure. I sometime barely see the wheel in conversations anymore! Also, the score of this game was lackluster. Some good about the game. I thought most of the main missions were fine ad well-crafted although they ended anti-climatically and the weaponry was good. The main teammates and old puns and people from the old games appear and make the game more enjoyable. Combat is great. Checkpoints are forgiving. Powers are good. Multiplayer is fun. And then, theirs the end. The ending of the game was so outrageous, disgusting, unethical, the biggest hypocritical scene made by BioWare that it made me mad. Even with Extended Cut DLC, it was terrible. I could have picked a better ending from my mother****ing ass. All in all, Mass Effect 3 was hyped up to be an excellent, but failed to deliver on so many levels. However, I still enjoyed the game for what it was. But seriously, DLC in this game is pretty OK, but they make it so short for 15.00 im spending for it",6,2013-04-05,PC,user

Minigun,"Here's a different kind of review: I actually liked the ending! Ok, so I started my Mass Effect journey with a bargain purchase of the first game in 2010, followed by a bargain purchase of the second part of series in late 2011 and now the final part in 2013. I still clearly remember the whole story and the feelings I had while playing it, so I can speak both for ME3 and the trilogy as a whole. Technically speaking, ME3 had superb audio and nice graphics. Very satisfying and enjoyable audiovisually. Game never crashed, I did not encounter any bugs either. Game felt very solid all around. The Origin requirement is a downer, but a small one. The atmosphere of the game (ie. the despair of the war) was a bit forced at times, but in the end held quite nicely. In ME1 I liked the feeling of vastness, how the plot spanned a lot of places on a huge scale. ME2 had perhaps did not have as epic a feel to it, for most of the game you spent hiring squad members from not-so-epic places and fights. I think ME3 went back to the roots in the epicness of scale. In ME1 I liked the fighting system and finding and upgrading new weapons. ME2 kind of streamlined the combat, but also removed all those micro-management details such as weapon mods. ME3 took somewhat a middle road in that regard: weapon mods return, but the weapon arsenal is quite limited. The biggest problem in fighting I had was Shepard getting stuck in cover when trying to run, resulting in a couple of unnecessary deaths in some of the harder fights. Other than that, gameplay felt pretty smooth. On terms of dialogue I think ME2 was the high point of the series. I really liked especially the female Shepards delivery of her lines. ME3 is not that good, but certainly not bad, either. The galaxy map mini-game this time was avoiding reapers, who were alerted by scanning the space for artifacts etc. I think ME1 had the best mini-game in that you actually landed on the planet and searched for stuff, even though it did get quite repetitive after while. In ME2 the mineral scanning was just dumb, as it did really not offer any challenge and there really was no big difference in the tactic you did it. The reaper mini-game in ME3 is again quite unnecessary, but at least you can apply some tactics to it, and it isn't really that much of an annoyance. And then there is the ending. I did play the extended cut, but also watched all the original ending videos from YouTube. I didn't really see the necessity of the extended endings, although they were perhaps a bit more satisfying. And the fourth ending type was indeed a smart move, which should have been in the original release also. On a side note, I also have played Eye of the Beholder, which threw you right back into DOS prompt after finishing the game, so I'm used to not having any fancy ending scenes. Anyway, most comments I've read about the ending being bad had two things in them: previous choices in the games had little to no effect, and not everything was explained. I think both are wrong accusitions. Choices in the previous games mainly affected your companions: who you were working with. At no point do I recall making any huge decisions directly regardin the forthcoming reaper invasion. Killed or saved the rachni queen in Noveria? Who cares, no one probably even knew she was there in the first place. Killed Wrex or was his best friends? Doesn't matter, there are plenty of krogans to be their leader, and plento of people on Normandy to be your wingmen. My point is, all the choices you made only affected the people around Shepard not things on a galactic scale. Therefore, I don't see how can someone expect so see any huge change in the outcome no matter what they did in the previous games. On the other hand, I still think they did a hell of a job with all the different combinations of who are alive and who you are with: dialogue changes according to the setting, and there are a huge number of different settings, which your previous choices _do_ affect. And the other thing, about leaving stuff open. I think the ending tied all the knots there were to be tied regarding galactic scale. Again, what happens to your mates is a different story, and left open. But that was not the point of the big picture. The point was the reaper invasion, and that was concluded in satisfying enough a way. The multiplayer requirement for the ""better"" endings was a stupid move, but I hear it was removed in the extended cut patch. I wouldn't know, as I ended up hacking my save game just to be sure I get the best ending: there were no multiplayer games anymore to boost your rating. All in all, a highly recommended game, and nowadays very good entertainment value for the cost: I only paid 9,95 in Origin store. I would give the game 8.5/10, which rounds to 8 just because of the multiplayer thing possibly affecting your single player campaign ending.",8,2013-03-29,PC,user

AlexFili,"Mass Effect 3 takes all of the plot pieces in the previous two games and delivers on a massive scale. The first thing you see is Shepard being put on trial for the events between the previous games. Just as the council get going on their debate, the Reapers launch an assault on the Earth, destroying a large portion of it. Shepard literally has to fight his way off the Earth, getting through some Reaper forces and just trying not to get hit by gigantic lasers and all the explosions which are occuring everywhere. Once you leave Earth, you have to try to get the support of the alien races to prepare against the Reapers. Unfortunately, the Reapers have already started attacking Palaven, the Turian homeworld and Tuchanka, the Krogan homeworld. You have to get the Krogans on your side for the Turians to help. Later on you’ll be attempting to gain the support of the Salarians, Asari and Quarians. There really is a feeling of tension and excitement that the other games didn’t have. For once, the enemy is a large opposing force and the whole galaxy is feeling it’s effects. The war is happening on three fronts. There are the main attack force of the Reapers, which utilise other alien races in their army, such as the Turian-style Marauders and the Asari-style Banshees. Then there are the Cerberus troopers, which are being led by the Illusive Man and are attacking colonies for an unknown reason. On a lesser front you also have the heretic Geth, which are attempting to keep the Perseus Veil under control. In most single-player missions you’ll be darting in and out of cover, attempting to pick off enemy forces. The overall intelligence of the enemies in this game has improved dramatically. Different units protect themselves in different ways. For instance, the Nemesis uses a sniper rifle to deal large amounts of damage, while the Phantom attempts to defeat targets instantly with it’s sword. When put together this is a deadly combination. There are also enemies that utilise smoke grenades, shields, turrets and more. Fighting is hectic and tense, using squadmates powers is recommended. You have a total of six squadmates in the main storymode and an additional squadmate exclusive in the extra Downloadable Content mission. While there are overall less squadmates than Mass Effect 2, the relationships between them and the character are more pronounced. Between missions characters will move around the ship, get into discussions and think about certain things. In the Citadel, each squad member goes to a different place, where they can talk with the player. Commander Shepard is the player character (which can be Male or Female), who is tasked with making lots of choices. Some of the choices are very difficult and will require the player to think forward. The choices made in Mass Effect 1 and 2 will dramatically affect the story. Such as how you dealt with the Rachni Queen or if you saved Maelon’s data on the genophage cure. You have a total of six classes, each with different unique skills and strategies which apply to it. For each additional form of support gained in single-player, you will gain another War Asset, with a numerical value. These values effect the strength of the forces attacking the Reapers, determining the overall success of the final attack. Mass Effect 3 is a fantastic game and a definitive Sci-Fi experience. Fans of the series will not be disappointed.",10,2013-03-28,PC,user
TheCuteKitten,"The only good thing about this game is the amount of weapons and customization for your skills. The voice acting is brilliant apart from Jessica Chobot. That's it. The story is full of plotholes, contradiction, retcons and downright nonsensical at times. The enemies and AI behaviour is subpar. Everything just bumrushes you and and do not use strategy of any sort. There is too little gameplay and too much cutscenes which makes the game feels like an interactive movie. There is also almost no RP element in the game apart from power customization. Your choices do not matter. The ending introduces new concepts altogether.

Gargus,"I'm not here to rip on ME3 just for the sake of doing so or because its what's cool to do on the internet like so many others. Basically ME3 is the worst of the series in every way possible compared to the other 2 games because it doesn't build or improve anything. It simply just tries to hurriedly finish the series for the sake of a cash in on the title. 1- There is no sense of exploration. The game as efficiently as possible holds your hand every step the way and has you actually being on the ground doing things the least amount possible. Side missions are carried out by quickly scanning a planet ala ME2 and then firing a probe. That's it. You don't explore, you don't get to check out uncharted worlds simply for the sake of curiosity or anything. Scan, shoot probe, side mission done all without even leaving the galaxy map. This tactic accounts for the majority of side missions. ME1 you could explore the galaxy drive around in that horribly handling buggy and had a sense of discovering things, ME2 you could land on planets and explore doing side missions with some not even firing a single shot like the crashed cruiser balanced on the mountain peak but all of those things are gone in 3. The game just holds your hand and ushers you from mission to mission. 2- You don't get to actually chose anything, everything is pre determined for you. Even if you chose the renegade or paragon path you get the exact same result and no one treats you differently and you get no alternative paths depending on your karma scale which makes it all incredibly pointless and just window dressing for the fact the story is entirely linear and so is your character. 3- The characters are all the same ones, only less compelling. There are a couple new characters but they are highly disposable and not even worth messing with. James for instance is basically just a guy who talks 90% of the time like a generic white guy, 10% of the time he throws out some Mexican phrases like saying ""loco"" a lot in his generic white guy trying to impersonate a Mexican guy and he looks like he was taken from the show jersey shore. When a old character returns you can see it coming a mile away. For instance you go into a area where the mission briefing talks about geth then you can see 45 minutes before which old character is going to come back. All the characters themselves seem hollow and rushed, they lack the personality that made them endearing in the other games and most are there only long enough to be overly obvious in a very specific mission or they simply show up for 3 minutes of camera time practically winking at the player with a nod and then are gone. 4- The story compared to the others ****. The other games had side stories, character stories, side missions with their own short stories and so on. ME3 on the other is basically this ""Everything is going to be destroyed"". That's pretty much it because no matter where you go or what you do its always about the war specifically and nothing else. I also got sick of hearing phrases like ""were here to save lives"", ""were doing this to save lives"", ""this weapon will save lives"", ""we need to stick together to save lives"", ""billions of lives are on the line and were here to save them"", etc and after about 8 hours I was sick of hearing about the war and saving lives. 5- The game play was basically just one big shooting gallery and hiding behind chest high walls. Every single fight is basically you hiding behind chest high walls to peak out and fire a few rounds only to hide back behind said wall. It was incredibly boring and has been done to death in dozens of other games. The combat was mindless and mediocre. It felt like they put absolutely no effort into the combat at all and rushed you through it in order to get to the next scene of hearing Sheppard say ""saving lives"". 6- The ending was atrocious. This is a series that prides itself on story, characters and dialogue. We all spent over 100 bucks playing all 3 games and spent over 100 hours playing all 3 games but bioware seemed to say ""This is the end of the trilogy so who cares about the ending"". The ending is the most important part of any story of any kind because its the very last thing you leave the person with and its supposed to be a reward, the climax to everything leading up till then, basically the ending is the most important part of any story. But the ending of ME3 was over in just a minute or so despite the dozens of hours of dialogue, cut scenes and story in the rest of the series they got lazy at the end. It gives no satisfaction at all. I can honestly say it is the laziest segment of the series. I did like though they had the balls to do what they did with Sheppard, but the ending still **** and doesn't make you glad to have finished the series.",1,2013-03-07,PC,user

Alsvha,"It could have been so good, but it fell short. Mass Effect 3 is a decent game, scared by some bad design decisions and an awful, inconsistent ending. The combat in the game is more fluent than the predecessors, the graphics is generally crisp despite Shepard still feel sluggish when running around and navigating the (static) world. The writing is decent in this game, however it does occasionally feel very 'soap'-television. Some of the characters are also very under represented in this game (especially characters like Jack, Miranda and so on). Even Ashley feels tacked on. Bioware's attempt at trying to set a dark atmosphere of doom and despair falls short in the game and it feels like many of the games 'sad' moments are so obvious that it's like trying to force an emotion more than build an emotion. Save perhaps for 'Mordin Solus' which is as brilliant a character in this as 'he' was in ME2. Weapon modifications are back (yah). Although you quickly learn to just pick the best weapon and use. The most redeeming part of ME3 is the music. Brilliant music. I can even listen to that while not playing the game that's how good some of the pieces are. However the quest system in this game is bad, very bad. Basically you have some main quests which drive the story forth. These are mostly gotten via the main characters. Then there's some side quests which is gotten via the mail terminal. Not much different than ME2. However then there's quests gotten from listening in on random people which pops up and requires you to 'scan' planets, and then pick up the item via the scan. However the journal system and lack of inventory works very much against this type of quests. The 'escape reapers' type-mini game or what it is, is just awful. And I don't know what they thought of bringing that into the game. And of course, the over shadowing ending, which invalidates and contradict much of the storyline from ME1 and ME2 (really obvious if playing all 3 in sequence). Makes most all of your choices throughout the previous game irrelevant. It did feel like leaving the game without an actual conclusion. The extended cut ending did not make matters much better, except as an insult to the fan groups which were disappointed. The DLCs for the game are decent, but no where near the quality of Lair of the Shadow Broker for ME2. Omega is very combat orientated, which is okay in itself, but it's not really Mass Effect. Leviathan felt tacked on and much more like an attempt to build an in-game foundation for the ending more than anything. Citadel fun, but eventually irrelevant as it feels strange to put that into the middle of an all out war for the survival of the universe as 'we' know it. But well it's a farewell and a last money grab by Bioware. Mass Effect 3 is a decent game. It's not an action-roleplaying as ME1 was. It's a better shooter than ME2, but it's properly too much shooter for many RPG fans, and not enough for the shooter fans. Bioware tried to grab both, but for what it could have been it falls tragically short of the target. Potential but lack of implementation. Bioware basically dropped the ball. It's worth a playthrough from the bargain bin, but knowing what I know now, I would not have bought it at release.",6,2013-03-07,PC,user

Jaz,"The third part of the ME trilogy had to compete with two masterpieces. It failed. Combat is ok, but combat was never its strong point. The trend to remove RPG components like ME2 did, continues. For example in order to get side quests you don't even talk to NPCs anymore, you simply overhear conversations. But ME2 had a saving grace, its story was still very strong. ME3 doesn't have that and its not just the ending. Main story is predictable and boring. Last but not least, your companions are simply not interesting this time. Their stories too. An average game, nothing to really set it apart from other shooters.",6,2013-02-24,PC,user

Anyway, it's a closing game, and because of that its great. have the flaws, but yet one of the best experience in 2012. And for being one of the best trilogy ever, deserves a 10 points.

oliver1h,"What to say that has not been said already? Importing your save files from the previous games is a must... Meeting old friends, and doing missions with them was the biggest fun for me. The story was decent, even some characters were total clichés (Kai Leng the Asian space ninja for example...). The combat was slightly improved compared to ME1 and ME2, but the cover system remained a litttle crunchy. RPG elements felt a little less developed than in ME2 (Renegade options for example were pure evil...They could have balanced the reputation system a little more...). Everything else basically remained the same as it were in ME2. I think the developers stayed on a safe ground on purpose. The music and sound effect were really good. Now let's talk about the infamous ending. Well they really screwed this up, and the ""Extended cut"" did not really makes it much better (When I first finished the ME3 my gaming experience was ruined...They can not make that back anyways with some cheap slide show, sugar coating stuff!) About the indoctrination theory! I think the developers at one point (might ...not sure) wanted to implement it, but they did **** theory is now refused by Bioware and EA so it is not part of the original Canon. Overall a decent game that stays in the safe path, with a bad ending. Could have been the best science fiction game trilogy ever, but they failed!",5,2013-02-07,PC,user
Vilyn117,"This game rightfully earns a 7. And while I could just blabber on about the ending, the subpar game mechanics, and most of the horrendous design choices in general, I'll just sum this review up simply. Don't buy this game for a satisfying single player game, but it for co-op with your friends. Co-op is the only reason I own this game, with a whopping 500 hours played on it, it's fantastic. And with free DLC content being added, you can't go wrong. The MP is fantastic in my opinion, and while it doesn't feel ""like mass effect"" because it's a 3rd person horde mode and not a story driven emotional title, it's fantastically done. Do yourself a favor and skip the campaign.",7,2013-02-07,PC,user
thatkid1995,"In my mind, Mass Effect 3 is flawless. The combat is rich and solid, the story is the best I've ever encountered, the characters leave such a raw, visceral sense of emotion that I actually teared up on a few occasions. There is no other game that is such a complete package. The endings were well written and fantastically executed. This is how you make games. BioWare have touched the sky here and there is no turing away from such a well written and well made game",10,2013-02-06,PC,user
KillerCornflake,"My first experience of the Mass effect series was through the second game in the trilogy, and that really did set the standard high straight from the off. I thought the best idea would most likely be to purchase the 1st game before playing the 3rd one as to account for decisions made throughout the saga. This turned out to be a rather meaningless venture as determined by Mass Effect 3. With the good, the graphics in this game are neat and arguably the best out of the bunch, it's polished and tidy with a few exceptions that require the gamer to overlook. Combat has been unstuck slightly from what in my view was a more static system in ME2 and ME1, refinement can be observed. With the bad then, bearing in mind that most fans of the series will (rightly so) compare this title to it's predecessors, thats what these points are based off. The dialogue options came as a shock to my system, they took away what made the previously fun and exciting conversation choices and beat them down to formulaic two way cutscenes. Even if a player is to explore every single option in a wheel with more than two choices, it merely serves as providing information that mostly accounts for the people who have never played ME before, this trend is also visible with BLATANT repetition of the lore of some species (geth quarian war) that it makes long term players sit and think 'hmm i knew that'. Compared with the other two games, the ""sidequests"" in ME3 are for the most part dull fetch and return tasks to introduce a feeling of galactic warfare, yet in actual fact it is just another way of EA herding people to spend money in a cash shop to upgrade for the multiplayer seeing as it is the easiest way to increase ""galactic readiness"" which is ESSENTIAL if you want to end up with a ""good ending"", i won't get into that one. In short ME3 takes a few steps forward in combat and graphics departments, even so these are still not perfect by any means, even small matters of convenience such as in ME2 your squadmate's ability they were using was highlighted on the tactical menu so you could see what you selected, here it's not, little things like that. ME3 takes a major step back in terms of dialogue choice, i can't even talk to my own companions without the game deciding when it it ""the right time"", even then i can only say a selection of similar phrases. I'd get the game purely for it being ME3 and the end of the series, but don't go in with a high expectation of it matching what you had come to expect.",5,2013-02-05,PC,user
alsec,"Mass Effect 3 will not force you to make tough decisions on a galactic scale. The RPG element from the first one has been taken away, and replaced with longer action packed combat. Having 3 games to tell a story, but leaving the player with an ending less desirable, greatly disappoints. If with those gripes, I give it a 7 because it is still a fun game, and the story leading up to the ending held me with suspense. It is no means as good as the first, or second games in the series, and that does disappoint. But taking a seat back and looking at it for what it is, I enjoyed the game.",7,2013-02-05,PC,user
AlienSpaceBats,"Painfully disappointing, and I can't have been alone in expecting better. 50% of the game is mindless pandering and fan-service (unnecessary). Corners were cut and the game was clearly rushed out the door, worst: lies were told by members of the development team pre-release. Mass Effect 3 is a minefield of immersion-breaking lazy (or poor) coding, audio and graphic glitches, low res textures, no DirectX 11 support, horrible animations and embarassing, fan-fic quality writing. The dialogue wheel is now completely arbitrary and the auto-dialogue is very poor, the journal is an unusable mess (bordering on non-existent) and the game cannot correctly import a character file without it looking FUBAR. In terms of gameplay, the shooter element is better than ever (fluid, fast-paced), and action sequences are great fun (although BioWare's insistence to use the SPACEBAR for everything borders on the ridiculous). Dialogue in general is riddled with clichés (the line ""I'll sleep when I'm dead"" is actually spoken, without irony) and the less said about the god-awful ending the better. Despite all this, the game is enjoyable at key points and some semblance of what-could-have-been is glimpsed during the Sur'Kesh, Tuchunka and Rannoch missions, however this means the game peaks halfway through before taking a nosedive. Special mention should go to the soundtrack artists (Sam Hulick especially) and the fantastic cut-scene direction, Most surprisingly though, the much dreaded multiplayer (pre-release) turned out to be an excellent addition that for me has extended Mass Effect's life by 9 months (and counting).",6,2013-02-04,PC,user
Bryjoered,"God this game just isn't very good at all and seeing it in the top 10 for 2012 kind of sickens me. Yes, the combat is equally as fun, maybe a little more fun that its predecessors, but the skill system is this stripped down 3rd person shooter now. Also, the great storylines and side missions that were the absolute best part about the first two games are pretty absent from this one. The side missions are so dull and I just rush through them not caring at all about my dialogue choices, and the main story is pretty sub-par as well. Let's all face it, Bioware has sold their souls to make some cheap bucks. It started with the horrendous Dragon Age 2 and now this.

Positives: Main plot is just epic, great and awesome Gameplay is finally refined, making this a fun shooter Emotionally impacting story AMAZING soundtrack As always great voice-acting (especially Mark Meer, Brendan Keener (sp?), Keith David) Javik! Quite good multiplayer, even if lacking Negatives: Scrapping of old characters (most of the characters from ME2 are only featured in cameos Side-quests aren't as good as they were in ME2 (still better than ME1) DAT ENDING, really WTF. Some plot points were left hanging (dark energy, proto-reaper from collector base, actually whole collector base decision is nonexistant) Handling of MAJOR decisions leaves much to be desired (Rachni queen, already mentioned collector base, rewriting/destroying geth etc) Aside from the main ENDING cutscenes, the last mission (priority: earth) which was advertised to DEATH is the worst, most boring missions in whole trilogy. I highly recommend the game, even in its flaws it's an amazing conclusion to epic trilogy. TBH, if the last mission (Priority:Earth) wasn't so lack-luster, noone would mind the **** endings.

It is a mediocre sequel and a disappointing finale to a well-loved series. Most unfortunate of all, however, is the way in which it and several other big-name titles of the last few years have come to represent the baldfaced corruption and lack of integrity within the video game industry. Games should judged as good based on their own merit, not on how many reviewers the publisher can manage to bribe. I give this game a four, for ""bad."" I would have given it an ""average"" of 6, but I subtracted one point for the paid-for reviews and one point for the way Bioware instructed journalists to attack their more critical fans. I regret having to look beyond the game itself and into the murk that surrounds it, but as the games industry continue to make video games less about games and more about the surrounding hype and media buzz, I have no choice but to add those factors to my score.

vazait,"This game is not good as an RPG, it's not good as a cover-based shooter, and it's certainly not good as a hybrid of any sort. This game is atrocious, it truly is. And this comes from someone who liked ME2, despite its flaws. But anyways, what's wrong with the game? Well, I think the ridicilous ending has been covered well enough by a lot of other reviewers, so I won't go into detail on how stupid it was. Let's talk about the dumbed down dialogue instead. BioWare and EA apparently thought three choices as a standard was a bit overwhelming when playing ME1&2, so they had to remove the middleground. What is left is the **** and ""Good Guy"" options, and the occasional Renegade and Paragon option. The Renegade & Paragon system is also pretty stupid. 'If you aren't nice to people, you can't make rational choices'... The **** kind of sense does that make? And with the removal of dialogue options, comes the removal of dialogue too. Which I can see makes all kinds of sense. Why would you shift the focus from shooting endless hordes of Cerberus troops, over on the thoughts and psyche of the interesting and beloved crew. We all know thats why we loved the original games, right? It was the neverending cover-based shooting that attracted us all... ... right? With all irony aside, I find it pretty annoying that the crew is even less talkable in the third installment, than in the second. In like 19 hours, I had the total of THREE, unique dialogues with Liara (whom I had romanced in the previous games), whereas only TWO of them were private and on the Normandy. That kinda ****, especially since she's one of my favourite characters in the entire series. Also: what's up with the character design? How come everyone dresses in the sexiest ""armor"" in the entire universe? Don't get me wrong, I am in fact a fan of the female body. But, why did Ashley throw away her giant power armor from ME1, in favor of the sleek, sexy outfit in the third? It looks stupid, and it doesn't make sense. But if she hadn't changed the armor, it would be significantly less time to show of her enlarged bazoongas. I'm not **** you when I say that the size of her **** have been increased from the first game. The entire game is so sexualized it just becomes silly. And to top it all off, they had to make EDI sexy too. I'm actually surprised she isn't a romance option. It would go along with the rest of this **** **** perfectly. And while we're at EDI: what's her deal? Why does she act so out of character? She's not an AI, but she acts like one. When I think about, practically everyone acts out of character. The only one who doesn't do so, is Harbinger. He does the best job of sticking to his... 'personality' and agenda in the entirety of the game. Even Shepard acts out of character. What's the deal with the homosex-romance? I don't dislike homosexuals in any way, but the sudden change of sexuality is just weird. So, is there ANYTHING good about the game, you may ask. Well, kind of. The skill system is decent, better than ME2's (worse than ME1's). The weapons and attachments are pretty good, I prefer it over both the first and second installments' take on it. The armor and armor customization is vastly superior to both 1&2, so there are some good things about the game. One could say it looks pretty too - and I somewhat agree, but you feel like you don't always belong there. The game shows off what it can do and how beautiful it is, and sometimes, one ends up just as a watcher. My final complaint is in regards to Cerberus. Why did the story shift the focus away from the Reapers, and onto Cerberus? I don't feel like I'm saving the galaxy most of the time when I'm playing. Battling wave after wave of Cerberus-troops isn't fun, it doesn't make you feel like you're saving the galaxy, and it only makes you wonder why you are bothering with it. Feels kinda like busywork. All in all, this is one of the most disappointing games I have ever encountered. Mass Effect was one of my favorite games, and together with sequel one of my favourite game series. But now I can't even thoroughly enjoy the first installments, because I know it will all be in ""vain"", as this game is so butt****ingly stupid. This game is abominable. Steer clear away from this thing. The only reason this game isn't getting 1/10, is because it has Liara, Tali and Garrus in it (even though none of them want to speak with me).",2,2013-01-05,PC,user
Daverid,"These days I play just RPG's (And the occasional session on WoW), I have all but lost faith in the FPS and RTS Genres. Nothing quite **** me in like an RPG with a; Riveting Plot, Interesting Characters, Good Gameplay and a powerful sense of Immersion. Mass Effect 1, although lacking in the Gameplay department, was 10/10 on every single other aspect of the game. Mass Effect 2 corrected the Gameplay errors that were extremely evident in ME1, however the plot took a MINOR hit, but still was extremely engaging. Then Mass Effect 3 rolled around, and I don't really know what went wrong. People blaming EA, People blaming BioWare... Who knows, all that's evident is this game was nowhere near the sequel we were waiting for. The gameplay didn't really improve from Mass Effect 2, but it was good in ME2 so it remains good in ME3. The Characters are still as interesting as ever (and as cool), but of course instead of the massive party selection we got in ME2 it was reduced down to ME1 numbers. And the plot, was just ... A mess (And that's giving it credit). If there's one thing I can say positive about BioWare, is that at least they still know how to write engaging and interesting characters. I cried several times throughout the game, simply because you get so attached (Or from the previous games) to these 3D people and it's hard to watch some of the tragedies happen, even if you can tell there was going to be casualties in the game. If it wasn't for BioWare still doing such an amazing job in the character department, this game would be lucky to receive a 2 or 3. The plot is just an abysmal mess. You can't really explain the mess without massive spoilers so I'll simply say this. Alot of people (Inlcuding myself) claim that it's 'The Ending' which was at fault, but frankly we just used the Ending as a scapegoat, we didn't/don't want to admit that the problem is in reality the entire game. Singular planet plots like Rannoch and Tuchanka is great, because you're concluding something that was setup in the other games, but the whole 'War Assets' and the nature of the 'Overarching Plot' is just a disgrace. And then after being taken on this wild ride where you go from, 'What the heck this doesn't make sense' ... To 'Omg this is fking awesome we are doing something massive and important' ... Back and forth multiple times, just to end on the 'This doesn't make sense' side of the fence was just the Ash sprinkles on top of the Crap Cake, and it hurt the fans deeply. It's clear alot of the story was designed with players who had been with the series for a long time in mind. Moments that would leave a normal person lifting an eyebrow, was leaving us fans who had been playing since ME1 bawling our eyes out. But then they made this Overarching plot to serve, I don't even know who, because it didn't make sense to the fans and it didn't make sense to anyone else. It was just some kind of strange mess. So if you're going to play this regardless of reviews, enjoy the characters, enjoy the locations and enjoy the decent gameplay. Enjoy the Single planet Arcs like Tuchanka and Rannoch, but don't expect to understand the overarching plot, and certainly don't expect to be satisfied and the end, because most likely you won't be.",4,2013-01-05,PC,user

The_Blackmoore,"So the holydays are soon to be over. Every xmas I end up playing old games or trying out titles I skipped when released, sometimes I return to old mmo's or fire up battlefield or COD. This year I ended up buying (among others) the Mass Effect series on the cheap. I played ME1 a couple of years ago, but being a hardcore mmo player the streamlined gameplay somehow left me disappointed back then. Treat it like a interactive book or a movie instead To be honest the problem was, I misunderstood the whole concept and compared it to computer games and mmo gameplay I general. When I returned this winter I choose to treat it as a interactive book or a movie instead - and boy was I in for a ride. I played thru ME1 and ME2 and finally in ME3. For the first time I have actually cried during certain moments in a computer game. As an interactive movie or book the Mass Effect trilogy is one of the greatest games/stories of our generation. It's a trilogy and should be experienced like one straight up. Gameplay is pretty streamlined, but Bioware leaves you with a ton of hard moral choices within the story itself making the game taking some really different turns depending on how you decide play it. There at least three different endings - each of them depending on the decisions you made during the game(s). The replayability is not all that great, the core of the story will always be the same, but the relations with your comrades, alliances with other races could change dramatically. It's the little things that stand out and stay with you. The deep comradeship with Garrus or the fact that there at least two crewmembers being openly gay. The different romantic relations you can pursue. Or the moments when you have to sacrifice one of you teammates. In my case one who had been with me from ME1 If you're looking for cheap games on Steam or Origin the Mass Effect series is a great choice if you likes me missed out earlier. It's breath taking. The Mass Effect trilogy is one of the greatest games of our generation, and you would be a fool to miss it.",8,2013-01-04,PC,user

Orlandu84,"It wasn't bad, and it wasn't superb either. I cannot comment upon the original ending because I played it with the extended ending. Having said that my complaints with the game have to do more with character interactions, scope, and pacing than anything else. First, unlike Mass Effect 2, Mass Effect 3 never made me care about the characters all that much. The magnitude of the Reaper War made characters and their own personal problems quite trivial. This point begs the question of scope. The game attempts to achieve an epic feel while maintaining familiar with the main characters. Unfortunately, it fails in this respect. Despite its giant space battles, the game never created an atmosphere that conveyed the gravity of the situation the characters found themselves. Then again, this could equally be my failing as much as it is the game's. For after two previous installments of Shepherd saving the cosmos, I am kind of used to the stakes being very high. Lastly, the pacing just felt off to me. The final battles did not seem to build all that much dramatic tension. Also, we learned too many important facts too quickly at the end for their significance to be comprehended. Having said that, the game is still good. The plot does make sense. The voice acting is really good. The action is engaging. I had fun. Unfortunately, it was not the masterpiece most of us were hoping it would be.",7,2012-12-31,PC,user

fartbarfunkel,"Not even taking the endings into consideration, I don't understand how people can actually think this is a good game, let alone a success from BioWare. Mass Effect 1 had its faults, but brought us an expansive, detailed universe and a solid story line. Mass Effect 2 was a disappointment (Cerberus. Stripping RPG elements.) but still had very engaging characters and enjoyable recruitment and loyalty missions. Mass Effect 3 is by far the weakest of the trilogy. It's completely abandoned the things that made the first two games memorable. The characters have largely become caricatures. The most prominent example of this that I can think of is Wrex. Many of his lines are painfully OOC, as if BioWare decided to superimpose Varric from DA2 onto him. The cheesy, cringe-inducing lines are piled on thick. I played through a second time as a full-paragon, and ended up skipping as many of the horrible lines as I could because it was so embarrassing. When the game forced me to listen, there were times when I found myself saying ""SHUT UP."" The completely blatant fanservice strips the game of sincerity. The entire game I felt like BioWare was just humoring me and those bizarre threads on their forum with pictures of FemShep pregnant with Garrus' baby or whatever. The content is just offensive to those who have been playing since the first game. But the worst thing is that you're forced to play as action-movie protagonist Shepard. The dialogue options are extremely few and far between, the neutral options are gone, the interrupts have been slashed. You watch a character that you may have been creating over the span of three games talk for minutes on end without any input from you. Because of this, the things Shepard says are really odd. Sometimes a full-renegade Shepard spouts bizarre idealistic bleeding-heart lines. And in turn, a full-paragon Shepard can act very insensitive. WITHOUT ANY INPUT. You can't shape anything about Shepard except some of the choices he/she makes, when before you could both shape those choices and WHY Shepard would make them. Obviously there were so many other issues. The PC controls, the animation (FemShep's running animations on the Normandy reminded me of Steamboat Willie or Popeye or something), Origin, Day 1 DLC, the massive plotholes, Shepard is even stupider than usual (WTF is Avina, durr),Cerberus, the missed opportunities. The endings are still stupid with the extended cut, and the giant middle finger of a refusal ending shows you exactly what BioWare thinks of the fans who have brought them here, the ones intelligent and dedicated enough to point out that a paragon Shepard has always found a way to get missions done without sacrificing their beliefs and would never accept the Starchild's logic. When Casey Hudson talked about dismissing a final boss fight because it was too ""video-gamey"" for the endings we received, it all made sense. Hudson just wanted to make an action movie. That's it. But instead of an action movie, or a good game, we got the steaming pile that is Mass Effect 3. This series had so much potential. But its potential AND everything it had already gotten right was squandered in this title in the name of trying to please both action game lovers and bizarre fans with banners begging for fatuous dialogue options, romances, etc, and for the egos of Hudson and Walters.",0,2012-12-24,PC,user
runeron,"I bought this game since I've played through both ME1 and ME2. After reading a lot of bad reviews, I didn't play it until recently. I have to say, after finishing it I don't understand why it has gotten so many bad user reviews. Sure, it could have been a lot better in many ways, but the game is fun to play and offers many hours of entertainment. I'm also positively surprised as to how fun the multiplayer is. If you haven't bought the game already, it's well worth the money. Don't rush through the game, and I'm sure you'll enjoy it as well; It's not all about how good/bad the ending is (the way it is done was actually a bit disappointing).

Knyte,"Well... You can really see the difference that EA taking over Bioware has made in this game. Essentially, they improved the visuals, and left everything else by the wayside, making what should have been an outstanding final title in a great series just another mediocre sci-fi shooter. The cutscenes and voice acting are weak compared to ME1 and 2, the storyline, while interesting is not very innovative, especially when they had so much to work with from the previous games. One thing that really annoys me is the combat; it is more twitchy and the controls are not as intuitive as the previous games. Add the ridiculous FPS style hit counters and you get a sub-par combat experience. The game does have some nice visuals and the scale of the combat/war is cool at various points throughout the game, however that isn't nearly enough to redeem this. What EA did to this series is a travesty... It could have been so much more, and I have never been so dissapointed with a game. It's really too bad Bioware sold out to the big kids before finishing off one of their signature series.",0,2012-12-10,PC,user

Hint: you should play the prequels with all available DLC:s to get most out of ME3 - all on insane difficulty, of course. I really do not get people who complain about the possible endings. I found them satisfying. The only flaw I found in this game was that I could not holster Shepards weapon.

The previous games had some great gameplay mechanics, but were **** out of this game. It's like the game is Mass Effect 2 with some improved graphics, but much lazier organization, atmosphere and character development - it all just feels sloppier.

Why should someone buy an incomplete game and then spend extra money to buy ****ing dlc's just to understand and enjoy the game. You know what I never even looked what dlc's you looters have released for this ****, buying is far away. This game could have been a master piece if released as whole not in game and dlc's manner but your money hungry and looting desire destroyed and disgusted it. All the dlc's released throughout the series were part of the whole story and yet were released in main games but as dlc's. What if some one has bought ME1, ME2, ME3 only. Why look and buy dlc's just to understand the whole story and enjoy it. But if you think this strategy of looting our hard earned money will work then you are wrong. We have other means to show you that this strategy is a big mistake and is going to loose customers and fans. BE AWARE. Other than that lets talk about main game i.e. ME3.

It's quite **** then I enjoyed...Damn...Catching up with characters from the series I guess...That's about it. The SP campaign felt like a real chore to me. The textures were pathetic in places. Pretty much no graphical options on the PC. The animations are laughable sometimes. Lots of clipping. There are a ton of bugs and glitches that I encountered and a few random freezes/crashes. The cover system is a completely broken mess. The writing was half-assed. Getting through the game to see the conclusion was a massive chore and not really fun at all. Regardless of any of your choices, there are only 3 endings with very slight variations. None of them are satifiying, and if you want to see a different one from the one you chose the first time, you have to sit through about half an hour of unskippable cutscenes and painfully...Really painfully slow 'gameplay'. I am not kidding, I actually put a weight on my keyboard, on the 'w' , went and made a cup of coffee and came back and I had only just arrived at where I needed to get to...Really, REALLY poor design, story and gameplay **** just feels incredibly unpolished and unrefined, and generally a step back from the 2nd game.

This is a very poor game design because I actually played both ME and ME2, but I didn't keep the game saves. Without the saves, ME3 makes many assumptions that didn't match with my personal experience from previous games. It gives me limited dialog choices and event outcomes. I had to act out of characters in several occasions. It's one thing to enhance experience using previous game saves, but to require it to unlock main event outcomes is a very very very poor game design.

The ending is simplistic and the lead-up to it is long and tiring (the fight to the tower never seemed to end).

TomSEA,"It's six months after release and I finally played and finished the game with the extended DLC endings. Guess I'm going to be in the minority who believe it was an excellent gaming experience. The cinematics, story (touching bases or bringing back old primary characters into the story), music and combat fights were epic and top-notch. I had all the DLC content that ended up being about 35 hours of game play which I felt gave me good value for my purchase. As far as the endings, I thought they were fine. I'm not sure what else you could have done with the story. I'm glad that Bioware didn't go with the cop-out ""it was all just a dream"" ending - could have been easy for them and they probably wouldn't have received a fraction of the grief. I went and looked at the original endings on YouTube and think that people who gave the game a ""zero"" or ""one"" score have some serious problems separating gaming life from real life. It simply wasn't that bad. And even if it had been the worst ending in gaming history (go look at the ending of Far Cry 2 if you want to see that), the rest of the game should have warranted at least a 6-7 score from reviewers. At least those who give honest reviews instead of trying to be spiteful. But I do give props to Bioware for listening to the complaints and coming up with some additional ending media. They didn't have to do that, but they did. I only have two real complaints - 1) the ""duck and cover"" command (spacebar) was problematic. Often I would use that command, end up behind a barrier and I couldn't move away from it - or at least without some difficulty. A bad guy would flank me and blast away and there was nothing I could do. And 2) the log-in sequence to the EA/Origin was atrocious. Nearly a 5 minute boot-time for everything to be up and running and synched. Ridiculous... In a nutshell, the whole series is a one of the best gaming experiences a gaming enthusiast can play and ME3 was the crown jewel of the 3. Put aside what you've heard from naysayers and if you haven't played the game, give it a shot - and start from the beginning. You won't be disappointed.",9,2012-10-31,PC,user
dreamreaver,"I have one message to ppl who want to play ME3 and..; 1) loved ME1 because: a) it developed believable world b) introduced to great characters c) had logical plot d) had many flaws, bugs, but beside this was sth you could love 2) swallowed ME2: a) which had good character missions, tho it lacked true main plot b) which was a step in different path rather than repairing mistakes of the first game c) which simplified many elements, tho took many aspects in favor The message is: ME3 has some (few) advantages to the second installment, still it isn't sth which ME1 fans were dreaming. The change of the franchise with ME2 has more depth now; acquiring side-quest by (only!) hearing some conversations would be nice if it was some fetch missions... but all?!

The main gameplay mechanics have been dumbed down, this time being squad combat. There are less squad members, the new members are generic, unecessary and just plain boring, you cant see squad member health in the UI AND dialogue options have been reduced to nothing more than a simple response for every longass conversation instead of choosing an option for replying to every segment of these conversations. The gun modification/upgrade element is gimmicky and dont reflect the sophistication of the original game's upgrade system nor the simplicity and accessibility of the 2nd game.

Its just a bit disappointing that the game looks and plays amazing just as Mass Effect 2 does but they made it shorter and ****ed the ending story of the series. Since release they have fixed the ending, released more content, and the biggest DLC to date, Omega, is to be released soon so my score for this game is certainly improving.

I would play this game if one of the following were not true: (1) Same graphics; What was very advanced in 2007 (ME1) par in 2010 (ME2) is now simply sub-par in 2012. (2) I like to sit back with a logi/xbox360 style controller. A keyboard, while very good, can limit you in certain situations. While many games released in the past 2 years have instant support for controllers, this game has none. (3) Same engine. ME2 was a great game but I struggled to finish due to the robotic engine. The great story, art, music and characters kept me playing through the bland game. Adding a halo-blade animation to your punch and changing health to blocks instead of bars doesn't change the gameplay. My skills were 90% exactly the same as the last game!

I implore you to enter this game with an open mind, not clouded by the hate of the gamer ""community"" and see this game for what it is, it may have drifted from its RPG roots but I think for the better with my play style, I've thrown hours into ME3 and enjoyed every second of it. The leaving Earth scene is both awesome and saddening at the first time and sets the tone of desperation for the story to come, the Reapers are a terrifying and brilliant foe and the gameplay represents a challenge in many areas of the game. I didn't even think the ending was bad at all, when I finished it I put my controller down in contentment without realising it would be so badly bashed by whiners everywhere.

vincesz,"Not a terrible game like people make it out to be (after hating the ending) but it's not as good as the last two either. For me ME2 reflects the pinnacle of the series and this was definitely the nadir. The main issue with this game is that it's been 5 years since ME1 came out and 2 since ME2, but there's been virtually no innovation since then. ME2 didn't have too much innovation either but it streamlined everything down and expanded on ME's strengths with a better class system and weapon's system etc. This game feels more like an expansion of ME2 rather than a full fledged stand alone title, sadly. There's also a very distinct 'cookie-cutter' feel here that makes it seem like you've played this game before beneath a different coat of paint. It doesn't really feel like a lot of love was thrown into the project, just following a formula and spitting out the results. It feels very artificial and contrived and there's very little in the way of surprises. It makes the whole thing feel a bit tired and boring. As negative as this all sounds it's still a decent game; you can't really **** when you copy ME2. Not as thrilling or as suspenseful and addicting as its predecessors.",6,2012-10-10,PC,user
Muchomexicano,"Mass effect 3 has his flaws but overall it's a great game. Bioware has exceeded as always with their story telling till the end. If you ever think that is a unfair assumption then consider the fact that their biggest selling point of the game since day one is that your actions matter. This is completely taken away in my opinion by the progress bar instead of adding as many upgrades or doing hero missions and hoping for the best. Also in accordance to the ending I would've preferred a sequence of screen-caps and text like fallout did which would go over your choices and their consequences in more detail instead of being rewarded your choice of 3 different colors. Ignoring the dismal ending the story and universe in my opinion is more realized and alive then any other game or even movie for that matter, I'm a Star Wars fanboy and I enjoy the mass effect universe better.

I follow the herd in mourning the way it ends, but personally I don't care as I never invested much in this franchise emotionally. The whole franchise is a long interactive movie. Thank God its over, and lets hope Bioware will take the basis assets and ideas and use them to build some better games that let the players tell their own stories. The cities were always WAY too small in this game. The levelling and RPG elements were never very good. But the visuals, the voices, the NPCs were all phenomenally good.

The internet classed Mass Effect 3 as poor. All those bad comments made me think Mass Effect 3 would be poor. I wanted to see for myself. Now I can firmly say - the internet is filled with idiots.

Commander Shepard would be dissapointed with these people giving Mass Effect 3 a bad score.",10,2012-09-26,PC,user

mowca,"Your first impression on this game may be good. But after all i need to give it ZERO. i played all classes, with multiplayer and all side missions and seriously this is not even a game. It has fine moments of story and THAT IS ALL, and to be honest i bought this game because i wanted to see how this story ends. THE ENDING IS HORRIBLE and without DLC extended cut its not even an ending. Maybe it is an action game but i completed all content using just ONE F***ING KEY. You can put match in your keyboard and focus only on mouse to complete this game. There is only ONE moment you need to use something more. They way you do your side missions is so annoying i wont even write about this. Don't buy this S***.",0,2012-09-18,PC,user
dpark189,"It has been so long since the release and I'm sure if anyone did some basic research there would be nothing I could say that would be new to them. This franchise started out promisingly but it seems that the quality of the writing went downhill somewhere along the way. it's almost as if bioware just started thinking that ME was too big fail to a certain extent, so released a sub-par product. I put in more than 100 hrs into the first 2 games but after playing less than 8 hrs of ME3 (completed with full EMS rating) I never touched it again, even after the new ending dlc. I felt that watching the new ""cutscenes"" on youtube was better than having to drudge through the game again. This game just felt like a chore. There was nothing in this game that it did better than any other game in the market. As an action game: if you are going for an action type game there are 2 things that you have to make sure are on the money at the very least: good controls and for single player games: a decent ai. for me3 there is one button that does every single action. sprinting, taking cover, opening things, talking to people etc. it's all one button! didn't someone think this would be a little much? and how come there is no way for the player to bind these actions to a different key? The AI is also pretty bad. they only do 3 things back pedal, play peek-a-boo from cover or just blindly charge. even in the hardest difficulty i never found myself thinking of using a clever strategy or anything like that. most of the time the only reason why anything is even slightly difficult is just because the AI just gets a damage and hp buff but still act like complete idiots without the slightest clue on whats going on. as an rpg (gameplay-wise): a big part of an rpg is customization. armor, skills, weapons, and the feeling of accomplishment when you get that one rare item. me3 fails on all counts. there is a very minimal amount of customization in all of these categories. armor and weapons are one of the biggest disappointments, everything is just a recycled item from a previous game that many of us had already unlocked/found/bought in a previous game. So there is no real sense of accomplishment but more of just recovering what was already yours to begin with. As for the skills, sure there are different classes and 2 branches of any single skill but these skill trees are some of the most watered down ones i have seen. There is little to no real depth in combining skills and playstyles. if your an adept/sentinel you just invest in biotic explosion combos, if your an engineer you go for overload and the cryo/incinerate combo, if your a vanguard you just charge around, if your a soldier you invest in adrenaline rush and concussive shot or carnage since grenades aren't that useful, these are if your going to stay light for the recharge speed otherwise you could just go and stuff yourself with guns and just get run over. the class with the most variation is really the infiltrator since they can use a shotgun instead of a sniper rifle and that's it really. the game gets monotonous really fast, since all your doing is just doing 1 thing respective to the class you are playing. story: There isn't much i can say about this that everyone has already pounded into the ground. you can tell when a story is good when you feel immersed, you imagine yourself as part of the story in some way. at certain points you do feel this, but you are abruptly jerked out of it as some nonsensical plot device or quest jumps out and just slaps you across the face. so many of the quests are just fetch quests with little to no real significance and just drag out the story, leaving you to sit impatiently thinking ""get on with it!"" and it feels like shepherd is just a plain idiot sometimes. he says and does things that no rational person who is supposed to have gone through the same experiences would say. The whole first game was about finding the conduit which was a way to ""teleport"" to the citidel, yet in ME3 when the alliance needs to get to the citidel they just plum forget that this conduit even exists. not to mention shepherd seems completely emotionless as his friends die right in front of him (ie: thane, grunt, mordin, samara, legion, and pretty much anyone else). by the end of the game i hated shepherd, i felt like he was more of an impediment rather than a character you project yourself on to. This game is not worth the money. If i had known what this game was like before buying it, i wouldn't have even been willing to pay $30 for it. I feel like I would have been happier just ending it at ME2 and just thinking of it as a cliff hanger ending.",0,2012-09-17,PC,user

AutoNix909,This game is utter garbage compared to ME one and two. I seriously cannot understand why so many people propped this game as a wonderful experience when the ending was boring as could possibly be. The fact that NO new characters were available and that they wanted you to mix and match characters from the first two games who had no correlation to one another on most fronts didn't help either. The voice acting is terrible and overall it's a huge let down from two's ending let alone one which was rough around the edges yet ultra playable.

Nemo888,YOU MUST GET ALL THE DLC. With that this is the best Mass Effect. EA stripped out 5GB of content for the initial release. That is about one third of the game.

Chapa9dj,"Many things went wrong with this ME, starting with all my decisions in previous ME's that didn't worth nothing in this game. It was all for nothing. They simplified way too much to appeal new users and added an unnecessary and crappy Multiplayer. I didn't like the idea of seeing some of my team dying without having any choice, this was by far one of the worst thing they did with the game. The Soundtrack is pretty good but not that good compared to ME1 and 2, still is one of the strongest point in this game. . I took a lot of time to review it because i decided to wait for the Extended Cut and it was well worth it. Although it didn't clarify all my doubts and plot-holes in the game, it changed things a lot and made the endings make more sense.

Gqwewqewq,"Haven't finished the game yet, but so far I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised. The combat is improved (not much, and still not great ofc). They've made the galaxy exploring much better than the last 2 games. And there's a lot of nice touches, like crew members moving around the ship, having conversations etc. Also like that they've focused more on characters who can't accompany you on missions - I always thought that was a stupid self-imposed limitation. And the bad..... Dialogue has taken a nose dive (not all the time - some is still pretty good), but worst they've removed a lot of the options you have, moving far too many moments purely into cut-scenes. This was a problem sometimes in Mass Effect 2, and its got worse. Basically, certainly a step down from Mass Effect 2, and due to the first games incredible story probably from Mass Effect too.

That said, it's actually still a fantastic game, and I felt as though I was going to give it a perfect 10 throughout all of it, until I hit the ending. It's not a great ending, and I have many reasons why I don't like it. It does seem to mar the overall experience, but after some consideration, I did remember that there was a genuinely great game before that. Was it a satisfactory end to my Shepherds journey? Hell no.

gravothermal,"The Mass Effect series contains some of the best character writing in video games, period. You will never feel so close to and feel so deeply about NPCs in any other game. The hatred expressed on this site is a kind of perverse testament to that---people cared so deeply about the game that they are willing to troll because the ending hurt their feelings. But do not make the same mistake: the ending will make you sad and maybe angry, not because of bad writing, but because it is so unconventional and involves so much loss. The number of onboard conversations with the crew has exploded since ME2, and I would say the dialogues are the best of the series, save except for the amazing Lair of the Shadow Broker DLC for ME2, whose excellence was not topped in ME3. There were a few too many corny references to famous lines from ME2 such as ""calibrations"" and ""definitely worth it"" that slowed down the dialogue at times. The gameplay is a slight tweak and improvement on the ME2 experience. I would say that I am about done with the ME style of gameplay---spamming singularity+warp combinations has definitely gotten too old by the end of the game. There is much gnashing of teeth in the endgame on Insanity, but well worth it. Well done, Bioware---I hope that you keep true to yourself and don't bend too much to the rage expressed here and elsewhere.",9,2012-08-22,PC,user

The game itself is great, aside from a few bugs, but the ending is just so **** atrocious, so offensive, that I never picked up this game again after I beat it the first time, and this is coming from a guy who beat mass effect 2 5 times (I counted).

Jimbobbrown,"First off the multiplayer is fun, totally enjoyed my time on that even if it is rather limited. Secondly, I have to put the boot in over the single-player part. Its a shame cause its obvious so many people have put such hard work into it. The graphics, programming and overall story arc are fine but let down so fundamentally by the dialogue writers. Half the time I wasn't sure what the hell was supposed to be going on, or why x character had just been bumped off in seemingly quick and nonsensical fashion - I began to find it all rather funny waiting to see who'd get the chop next and how cheap and quickly it could be done. The ending isn't the problem really the whole single player game is poorly designed - the lack of choice, the overly long cut-scenes which the player has no input into, the lack of interesting side missions... fixing the endings won't help this game it needs to be re-booted (we get so many film re-boots, why not game ones?) preferably bring back Drew Karpyshyn too. I loved the first two games but felt compelled to finish this one only cause I had payed money for it, the single player game is that inconsistent and low quality. I rate the game as a five only for the multiplayer content and the hard work put into it by the development team (aside from the writers who seemingly didn't feel they had to trouble themselves too much). I don't blame EA for this, not too fond of origin but at least I got some money's worth out of the multiplay.

Gamtu,"The length of the game is acceptable. The graphics quality is poor. Including aliasing and lack of realism and no way for high end pc's to significantly adjust for it (likely because of monetary greed with no other focus in mind). The game play quality has been reduced from previous releases (likely because of monetary greed with no other focus in mind). For instance planet scanning has been all but removed. When you find a planet that can be scanned any items from the planet are recovered with probes only. You never actually fight for the scanned items you simply live or die. Living through it is quite easy to do. A lot of adventure was removed from the game because of this. I thought it felt like an easter egg hunt in a big hotel, all the rooms are identical and so are the eggs. The eggs are just hidden in different places in each room. This game is not an RPG it is an action game with a sprinkle of role play. I thought the ending fit in well with the rest of the game. I didn't like the ending or dislike it. I'm glad I didn't pay release day price for this game. These days those of us PC gamers really have to be cautious of paying release day price.

Yes, it does feel that good while playing. Just those last minutes leave you with a feeling of ""That's it?!"" Mind you, the free Extended Cut DLC did make the ending slightly better, and I can't wait to see what the upcoming Leviathan DLC brings.

ArMoRofGOD,"There are a few honest reviews on here who are not trolling bioware for the ending of ME3. Heres my honest opinion. Mass effect 2 was a terrific game, it had great progression, great squad missions and an amazing long ending all leading to a pretty great boss fight. One of the best games Ive ever played. Mass effect 3 brought some terrific editions to the series, the best of which is the mutiplayer. That aspect alone gives the game much more credibility but if you just into single player than your still in for a great game but not as great as ME2 but a long shot. The intro is epic, the art is amazing, the music is great, and its optimized so well it runs at an incredibly smooth framerate at 5760 x 1080 resolution which says a lot. The immersion was great during the midgame, missions are very fun and well thought out, the voice acting is great and beleivable, the characters make you care about the universe and saving it so all they needed to do was wrap up this great series with an equally great ending which isnt easy but weve come to expect it. Without spoiling the ending, it had one great moment that I loved and the rest of it fell very short. Nothing at all connected to the player from their choices and it feels very lazy and very non unique to me and left a sort of dissapointment in the end. Despite that though, it was a great experience and the multiplayer ahs kept me coming back fro more for almost 50 hours now. On top of that Bioware has been giving FREE updates with maps, characters, and weapons and they released a better ending for FREE. All this equates to a fair 8.5 or so but ill round up to a 9.",9,2012-08-06,PC,user

piccina808,"As a huge fan of previous games, especially Mass Effect 2, to say that I am disappointed would be a serious understatement. The ending of Mass Effect 3 is not only the conclusion for this game, it's for the entire franchise, so for it to be like this is an insult to the fans. But to forget about the ending for a second, and look at the entire product, it's not at all brilliant. Combat is faster and yes you can now climb. roll, etc. but it just feels awkward, especially on the pc version, where one button for all makes your head explode. Tons of auto dialogue, many of the previous choices don't matter at all, it's like you didn't have any choice in the previous games, side quests are not side quests, they are fetch quests, extremely boring and idiotic, and to make matters worse, journal is a complete mess, there is no information about any of the quests, have you collected anything, is it 75% complete, no, so you better prepare piece of paper and a pen and get working.

Rayken,"Many people rate this game under 4 because of it's ending. Well, to be honest it had way more problems than the ending alone. The running animations were really bad (especially Anderson's) , there were loads of auto-dialogue which is not acceptable for a game like Mass Effect where dialogue is a gameplay mechanic, wasted potential for characters ( see: Liara as the Shadow Broker) and killing characters for no reason (see: Legion). Also, the sidequests (or lack thereof). The game had very little sidequests that involved actual gameplay, 75% of the sidequests being fetchquests. Then comes the horrible lore breaking ending. Even with the Extended Cut DLC it still is one of the worst endings to a trilogy I've ever seen. It also has little to no replayability and is extremely linear. Talking about replayability it also destroys the replayability of the other 2 games aswell, seeing as the ending doesn't show the consequences of your choices. The only good part about this game is it's combat, return of weapon mods and actual skill trees. Therefore I rate this game a 5/10.",5,2012-08-04,PC,user
jerjud45,"Most people may concentrate on the ending, but there is so much more that this game got wrong, especially when comparing it with previous releases in the series. The writing in many parts of the game was absolutely terrible, and Shepard did not feel like Shepard in many scenes. The overusage of memes from previous games was cheesy, out of place, and down right irritating. The journal/quest system, which they nailed in the first and second games, is an absolute mess in Mass Effect 3. The people responsible for the new journal system in 3 should be shot in the face for their incompetence, when they had 2 examples to build off of in the previous games. The ending, even with the Extended Cut, is still very unsatisfying and breaks the flow of the entire trilogy. I will give it props on its combat system, which is an improvement over Mass Effect 2's system. Personally though, I would have preferred it to stay more like Mass Effect 1, since these games were intended to be rpgs and not shooters. Although the writing **** most of the time, there were indeed some memorable moments and decent scenes. Overall, this game just needed more work. The game seemed rushed, and is not a typical Bioware release because the quality just isn't there. It's really disappointing to see this happen to such a great franchise and developer. Since DA2, Bioware just can't seem to do it anymore. First DA2, then SWTOR, and now ME3. Bioware is a developer to stay away from in the future as their quality has severely diminished, and I am sure this is largely due to EA's influence. If you have never played the Mass Effect series before, I would recommend staying away from it, as you are in for some disappoint in the 3rd installment. The first 2 are great games, but you will want to play this one too, which will ruin everything for you.",3,2012-08-03,PC,user
Feriatus,"I gave the low score to this game because it is not a quality game, it is just a cheap knock off mash up of RPG and 3rd person shooter. Ending story was good except you didn't have any choice, but why complaint, the choice was always just an illusion in this game. You choose something, watch different cinematic and then the game just goes on through the same small linear levels with the repeating boring enemies. There is nothing epic about this game. Mass Effect 3 is just an outdated game with super claustrophobic linear level design with one very very small quest hub called Citadel. There is not much to explore and if you do you just rewarded with missions to defend from the waves of enemies. It is not a triple AAA title if you measure it based on the gameplay, Mass Effect 3 world feels dead and empty, this is a below average game except for a few dialogs. And I bet if it wasn't for Bioware brand on the box it would receive critic average score of 3 out 10 here on metacritic.

MustisTheCat,"Very good game, but not as good as ME2. First off, it is even more simplified so it is not even a RPG anymore. Second, the searching for resources is dull. The graphics is merely average. There are much less NPCs to interact with and take on missions. The ending is dissapointing, even after the Directors Cut DLC. Where Me3 shines is general gameplay - the fights are very emotional, fast paced and offer a lot of ways to dispatch enemies. It feels like a movie - you interact with many things but you rarely have influence on anything. I`d rather call it an extended First Person Shooter. Nevertheless the multiplayer is very addicting with new stuff coming every few months. Overall the game is satisfying with some of the above average features. Solid title.",8,2012-08-01,PC,user
Ageoffan,"Ending killed it, completely, 1000% nuked it to jesus's 8th coming, killed it. The good: Combat, i actually enjoyed the combat alot, the cover system is well done and you had to use it for some quests which is great. Melee, who doesn't love a sexy holographic fistweapon to pwn your foe? Customizing my guns, sure it feels like it is taken from BF3,but it still made me able to design my weapon to my playstyle (one of the guns you get at the end, one that has a large clip, if not for the recoil reducing addon would be left in my closest). The Bad: Ending, horse is beaten enough, but the ending just ****. Great, 3 different colors, and for some reason all the relays are blown up although only one of the options was supposed to destroy em (i believe). And your crew on earth magically appeared on the ship, and for some reason Joker wasn't on planet earth, wtf? Story, i honestly felt 0 connection. ME1 I wanted to kill sarin, I was sad that i had to let my crew mate die back there (i forgot his name). ME2, Collectors must die! killed by crew, blew up my old ship, destroyed my relatinonship with Ashley. Must die! Harbinger was a pain as well, i really wanted to stick it to him. And the ending was influenced by how well you maintained realtionships with your crew. Mass Effect 3 had none of that. your standing with the crew doesn't matter, **** got removed, who comes with you on the final mission is also pointless. All your decisions are meaningless in the end. So, would i recommend it? Yeah sure, if you want to play the game and just kill some time, but other than that, i would not. Worst 60 dollars i have ever spent.",6,2012-07-31,PC,user
Jouna92,"Amazing game! Amazing trilogy! This is story driven game and good one where you choose what is going to happen. This game have epic moments, characters, voice acting, music and more.

yogibbear,"Oh my god. No spoilers here. If I explain why this game is PERFECT (even pre-EC) I will ruin the experience for you. Just believe me when I say the gameplay is somewhere between ME1 & ME2. The missions and excitement leading up the end for this trilogy are a lot of fun. The multiplayer works, you don't have to play it, but it is better than I expected. The singleplayer is 10/10 ignoring the MP. The ending made me cry and you got me Bioware, oh how you got me good! You actually made me stop hating you after DAII (oh I'll just pretend like that game doesn't exist). I finally bothered to play this game and I should have done sooner. Somehow avoided all spoilers and I am SO glad that I did. The reason why this game gets a 10/10 and not an 8 or 9 is because the ending is perfection. People complaining about it were not paying attention! Seriously, pure genious! Shutup and take my money!",10,2012-07-29,PC,user
Isaac_adhd,besides the much complained about ending ME3 lacks a lot of good rpg gameplay that ME2 did have. In ME3 there are too many cutscenjes although the graphics are awesome. Another miss is that you cannot see if you have completed your quest correctly. This is only possible when you search for the person who gave you the quest.That and many more little off things make this a pale release when compared to it's predecessor who was already receievd as an alltime classic but maybe part 3 stole that status from it again...,6,2012-07-28,PC,user
drSpockwa,"This has been a love hate purchase for me. * The story is good, although not the Epic everyone raves about. * The controversial ending is not as good as it could have been, but not as terrible as hyped * The combat experience is great! Leveling character kits from experience is a fun mechanic * Graphics aren't that great for this day and age * Lip syncing with dialog is horrible. They shouldn't have even bothered if this is what they came up with. My primary problems are around game stability: * I played this on the PC. I suspect console gaming is more stable. * The cover system is awful. They chose to use the same button for running and going into cover which means you spend about 10% of combat fighting the game itself to get into cover when you want to, or out of cover when you didn't want to, because you ran too close to a corner and it thought you wanted to go into cover. * If an enemy comes up behind you while in cover, good luck getting out of cover to run/melee. You can't melee from cover. * Waiting - You get to wait at least 30 seconds after pressing any key for the intro when the game starts, till you get the main menu, because the game insists on connecting to EA's servers then validating your DLC. Why couldn't this happen either quicker, or start during the intro? And why is this even necessary if I'm playing single player campaign. * Multi-player - This is really the part I like most of the game because it is pure combat. However: * The match making system is SLOW and flaky. You spend a lot of time waiting for the servers to place you with a group of other people. Very often I cancel and retry and it gets right in. * If you get sick of waiting for the Quick match to add you to an existing lobby/game, you can create your own, but plan on waiting at least 5 minutes for anyone to appear in your lobby. More waiting. * Once you get into a multi-player game About 1 in 10 games will have some type of syncing issue with the servers or peers. You'll shoot at enemies that are stuck pumping ammo int an enemy with out it's health meter changing, and then they magically appear next to you and kill you. * About 1 in 10 games ends with an enemy stuck in a wall or 20 feet off a ledge off the edge of the map, so you better hope someone has an area of effect weapon like a grenade to kill it or your stuck ending the match. * Experience and game $ is only awarded at the end of an 11 wave match. This makes some sense because you don't want people being flaky and jumping in and out and messing with the team continuity. But when the game goes nuts, and you get dropped or quit because there is no other option, you get nothing. * You get to the end of a multi-player game and there is an awesome stats screen to see how you did. But the guy that hosted the game decided he is done and leaves, so you don't get to review your stats anymore. * About 1 in 20 in game purchases will lock up during the transaction. Purchases are made from either real cash through bio ware points( I've never done it, and won't) or game $ you earn from matches. About 50% of the time, after you restart the game from the lock up, you see the pack that you purchased during the previous crash. * For a while, I couldn't launch the game till online research uncovered that I had to start Origin (EA's required digital distribution system) in Admin mode. I really wish this game were more stable, so I could enjoy it more Fortunately, I got it on sale 50% off, so I don't feel too hosed by EA and BioWare.",4,2012-07-28,PC,user
ImBigking,"The Mass Effect trilogy is just amazing and Mass Effect 3 is one of my favorite games ever. It shines in every single aspect but one: the ending.

kane148,"I really enjoyed this game up until the very end: the last 10 minutes or so were tedious and confusing, and the standard ending leaves you feeling very unfulfilled after all the time you've put into making tough choices and developing relationships with characters. Hopefully the extended edition will fix this problem. For most of the game however, I was happily immersed in the Mass Effect universe, and appreciated the epic scale of this final installment. ME3 seems to have backed away from ME2's simplistic upgrade system and re-introduces different weapon models and mods to allow you to customize your arsenal. I felt that it was a fair compromise between the unwieldy inventory of ME1 and the boring linear upgrades of ME2. While this game does have its share of flaws (lack of exploration, few side-quests, and the usual plot holes), it is a good game overall and well worth playing.",8,2012-07-24,PC,user
MelonPan,"the removal of neutral dialogue options was a huge disappointment for me, as I enjoy playing these games as a mixed paragon/renegade as opposed to going 100% for one or the other. What I loved about the previous games was that you could go full renegade, get an ending that was totally suited to your decisions, and it was a perfectly acceptable way to play. Being renegade wasn't ""bad"", it was just a different way to get things done. Neutral and paragon were simply other, equally viable ways to finish a game and experience it differently. But in mass effect 3, that all changes. Renegade becomes very much an option that the developers punish you for choosing, while paragon becomes the obvious ""correct choice"" option, and neither of the better outcomes to major situations are available if you mix paragon and renegade. You will also be punished for playing the game as a neutral character; you either go 100% renegade or 100% paragon. But in the end all of that is meaningless, because no matter what paths you chose earlier in the game, you will be shunted into the same 3 choices of endings",6,2012-07-24,PC,user
Mudget,"A great finish to a great story. This is indeed a series worth playing through from top-to-bottom. It's pathetic, truly pathetic, that this game has gotten such a low user score here at Metacritc. Seeing Mass Effect 3 in the ""4"" point range is enough to make anybody who has played and enjoyed the game as thoroughly as most people have avoid places like Metacritic for information altogether. Games get ""4'""s because they were rushed, crappy, or broken, and ME3 is none of these. It is a solid conclusion to a remarkable and already classic series of games. A definite videogame highlight of 2011. If you've never played the series at all, start with part 1 and move your way on through.

TheFlaminboy,"Just finished the Game with the Extended Cut, then compared it on Youtube with the original ending. I can see why many people didn't like the ending, there really are a few too many things left open in the original ending. The Extended Cut is therefore a nice addition to give players more closure. However, I have to say, that this is one of the most beautiful games I've ever played and definitely does not deserve the criticism it got about it's ending. I personally loved all the endings, even though I only chose the bad ending to see what it was like, normally I wouldn't choose it. This game is an amazing and perfect conclusion to the Mass Effect Trilogy and true fans will love it like I did. Mass Effect 1 had the most epic ending, Mass Effect 2 was the most epic game overall and Mass Effect 3 was the most beautiful of them all. Also, since it mainly used music from the first and second game and didn't show that many more additional good soundtracks (apart from the beginning and the end of the game) I give this game a 9 out of 10.

AdamTheDullBoy,"The biggest issue with this game is its failure to deliver what the overall story arch of the previous Mass Effect games was leading up to. Mass Effect 3 is nothing short of magnificent and plays very well until its last few hours; during which, however, it starts to fall apart in an unprecedented manner. Unlike during the brilliant final mission of Mass Effect 2, almost none of the thematically important choices the players made during the game (or the previous installments) manifest themselves in the moments where the Mass Effect trilogy should have reached its climax. This ultimately renders all Mass Effect games a letdown, even pointless, since the overarching consequences of our decisions have been the M.O. of the series from the very beginning. Likewise, the infamous ending of the game (even after the Extended Cut) is a textbook example of inconsistent script writing that feels incredibly disjointed from the core themes of the series, as if the writers responsible for the rest of the Mass Effect universe had nothing to do with it. In the end, it is irrelevant whether the third act of Mass Effect 3 is so cheap and rushed because of EA, greed, Bioware's obligation to implement a multiplayer into the game, etc. The bottom line is that it's a failure of the concept and the storytelling that made the series unique in the first place, in short, it is a failure of artistic integrity.",4,2012-07-19,PC,user
GeorgeA,"Forget the terrible, plot hole-ridden abomination Bioware calls an ""ending"". This game has far worse problems than that. An incredibly lazy deus ex machina plot involving super-mega-awesome reaper destruction device known as "" The Crucible"" to some of the most ridiculous scenes in the history of video gaming(Tali's possible death sequence, for example). The writing is atrocious and seems to be done by a seven-year-old fan-fiction writer. The ""neutral"" dialog response is now completely removed, so most of the time you have two illusionary choices in dialogs, which don't affect anything at all. That is,if dialog wheel even appears, as it has been mostly replaced by auto-dialog. The world of Mass Effect has shrunk from the quite large Citadel areas and dozen of huge,explorable (though empty) planets in Mass Effect to six crammed locations at the citadel with bland grey architecture and bleak Normandy in the third game. Not even four relatively small, but at least completely different hubs like in Mass Effect 2 .But the final nail in the coffin are ""**** way it works is already anecdotal-you wonder around the Citadel, ""overhear"" two people talking about some stupid item, your journal will update, you go to that area, scan the planet via boring planet scanner, ""retrieve"" that item and give it back to those idiots at Citadel. That's it. No dialog wheel, not even a cutscene, nothing at all. There are other kind of RARE side-missions, where you go to a boxed area and kill everything on your way to... retrieve data or item. There is not a single side-mission, which even remotely looks like an RPG quest should, let alone being interesting. The combat is the same as the second game, a boring cover-based Gears of War like shooter with million enemies per level to kill. Weapon mods are almost completely useless, armor sets are literally copy/pasted from Mass Effect 2 DLC. Hell, most of the time you can't even talk to your teammates on Normandy. The only reason I don't give it a zero, is because some really good moments here and there. In all, a disaster of epic proportions, no doubt. Bioware managed to destroy an interesting and promising science fiction action-adventure game with RPG elements and that's not easy even if you work deliberately to do just that.",2,2012-07-19,PC,user

It does what it set out to do: And that was entertain as a cover-based, third-person RPG-shooter.

It takes a while to get going but I was rewarded with an occasionally epic midgame and a reasonable ending to the whole saga. The combat scenes are far, far too easy though so I recommend pumping it above normal difficulty. It's also about the quietest game I've ever played so I had to drive my volume settings to about double what I normally use. Also I got the distinct impression that most of my travels were completely pointless since you fairly quickly reach the ""Minimum"" Force level to complete the game - I doubt greater values matter.

Gamers are not defined by gay ideologies or self-righteous straights, for crying out! we are just gamers. Fun games should not be used as devise where staff writers bow to the political right or left. So, with these three negatives I will not buy this game.

It is when game developers force you to play their way instead of allowing the gamer to make their own personal choice, then I say **** you Bioware and EA, I will start downloading free games from torrent sites from now on, until you stop nailing gamers up the ass with your nickel and dime DLC and politicking ideology crap.

Mojo_Spriggs,"I'll be going over various aspects of Mass Effect 3. However, for people trolling this game on Metacritic for the ending, this is not the place to cry. Don't give the game a bad rating because you ended up with the worst ending. Moving on to the graphics: Graphics: DirectX 9, runs very smoothly on most GPUs. An improvement from Mass Effect 2, but it cannot match the new DX11 games obviously. Story: I was very disappointed in the story. It was just ""Okay"". The storyline got boring after the second time playing it. It was also very short compared to Mass Effect 2's. Combat: Combat was improved dramatically from Mass Effect 2. Multiplayer: This topic is a hot one. In my opinion, i enjoy Multiplayer. It can entertain me for hours. Characters: There are very few characters from Mass Effect 1 & 2, and very few new characters that are introduced. This should give you an idea on how quick the campaign goes. Anamation Effects: By this, i mean ""Character Animations"". These improved a little from Mass Effect 2, but not by much. Issues I Found: The big difference between Mass Effect 2 & 3 is the combat. ME2 was about the 'Story', while ME3 focuses on 'Combat'. ME3's story get shortened compared to ME2, but it compensates by indroducing Multiplayer. I think Mass Effect is turning more into a Halo-like game. In the next Mass Effect, i'd like to see a deeper story that was more like ME2, however, i'd also like to keep the combat from ME3. I want to see a Co-op option and the MP taken out. I'm also hoping for DX11 graphics. Overall, the game gets an 86. It's a great game to snag 'On Sale'.",0,2012-07-10,PC,user
gambit1892,"I' ve played all 3 mass effect games, I believe the first one had the best scenario, the second was also interesting and improved as far as game play is concerned. The third installment left me with mixed emotions, I enjoyed the gameplay which is much more realistic and fun, you have more freedom on the battlefield and a larger variety of moves and enemies. The quest system where you search for Assets on planets is similar to the one M.E. 2 had, I think it is a quite boring, I would prefer to search for Assets with the Mako like in M.E. 1., but I guess that is subjective because others believe you could easily get lost with the Mako in M.E.1 resulting in frustration. Anyway, the weakest element in M.E. 3 is, in my opinion, its scenario and particularly the ending. I do not wish to write in detail about it, somethings are better left for others to judge on their own. However I must point out that it seemed sloppy and hasty, almost like fast food, quickly rushed off the grill and on a plate. I played the normal edition and the extended cut, which was slightly improved but still it just went from hot-dog to burger. I strongly believe EA rushed Bio-ware to launch the game in order to start generating income and unfortunately the end depicted that. I remember some years ago I played and finished Star Wars:Knights of the old Republic, also by Bioware, a great game by my standards mainly for the scenario. But.... KOTOR2 was a different story... published by Lucas Arts and developed by Obsidian because Bioware refused to succumb to the pressure of an early release, anyway that's not the point, the important thing is that when I finished KOTOR2 I realized I didn't understand anything, not just the ending..... So I' ve seen worse cases than M.E. 3, but unfortunately I've also seen better work from Bioware. If only they delayed one more month the game release, M.E. 3 would have had a different, more solid ending I believe, besides, it took them one month to release the extended cut dlc, and it probably cost them more, perhaps not financially, but ethicly and in terms of brand name, I don't think many people will pre order Bioware games from now on.......when glass breaks, it can't be glued, same goes for trust.",6,2012-07-09,PC,user

dragonxrage55,"I waited for the Extended Cut before submitting a review because I felt that was the most fair way to rate the game. As a stand-alone game, I think ME3 would have been pretty good. I enjoyed the combat system and a good portion of the plot. The characters are written in such a way that they truly become human to you, and you come to care about them. However, I feel this game was only average because I followed all the developer updates and advertisements on it, and I played the first two games in the series. I do not agree with the people who are giving this game a 0, because that certainly isn't fair, although I do understand that some people feel betrayed by Bioware with this game. I also feel that a perfect or ridiculously high score for this game isn't fair because it does not take into account that so much more was promised for this game. I will detail this as best I can without spoilers. The first thing I have to talk about it the multiplayer. Time and again, Bioware said that it was completely optional and that it was an alternative way to get the best ending. However, it turned out not to be true- mulitplayer was required to get the best possible ending. The Extended Cut changes this, and so that problem is rectified. However, I feel it is worth noting that Bioware claimed time and again that multiplayer was optional, and yet the only thing that caused them to fix this problem was the fan outcry. Something amazing that I have to say about this game is that the soundtrack is the best I have heard in a game in a long time. I wish they had this kind of soundtrack for the previous two games, because it is just that good. The bulk of the plot includes a pretty good story and side stories, as I said, but in the scope of the trilogy there are some problems. Many of the choices from previous games have little to no consequences. While I understand that it would not be possible to incorporate every little choice into this game, the game was advertised to show the consequences of the player's actions. Some choices were even stated by the developers to have ""huge consequences"" only for such statements to turn out not to be true. There are minor variations in the plot to account for player decisions, but at no point in the game are there ""huge consequences."" Another good thing about the game I found was the improved combat system. Combat is much more tactical and fun than the previous games. Even the multiplayer is a lot of fun. As stated previously, my only issue with the multiplayer was that it was forced initially. The combat system is fun, regardless of whether it is single or multi player. Finally, there is the controversial ending. If I could submit a review solely on the ending, that would be a 0. However, if I could review the entire game except for the ending it would be a 6 or 7. The initial ending would have been mediocre if it were the end of a standalone game. As the ending of a trilogy the prided itself on choice, the original ending was downright insulting, given that despite the player's final choice the endings were almost entirely the same. The Extended Cut keeps the endings thematically the same while essentially making them look different. It provides a significant improvement, and for many (including myself) it adds replay value to the game and the series. I have to say though, as someone who has been a fan since the original Mass Effect, that ending was not the ending that Mass Effect deserved. To people who have followed the trilogy, the ending was a massive disappointment. I am not letting that fact influence the score I give the game, because I do not think that is fair. The majority of the game is pretty good, and if it were not for the couple of other problems, the score I gave would be a few points higher, but the emotional part of me wanted to give this game a much lower score. Again, that isn't fair, and that is why I didn't, but to anyone who was a hardcore fan of this series, the ending, which essentially leaves what happens up to the player's imagination, is ridiculously disappointing.",5,2012-07-09,PC,user
Yazour,"After looking at all the red scores this game has received I have been compelled to speak out. I don't think most users have given this game a fair go. It has received this negative criticism for many reasons. Some of the criticism is fair, but most of it is drivel written by petulant children that didn't get their cookie. Firstly there had been unrealistic expectations placed upon it. It is the third of an epic trilogy. Not only did it have three times the attention that an original release would have done, but it also carried with it two games worth of changeable back-story that needed working into the plot. That is a serious amount of baggage for any development team to work with. Pleasing everyone was never going to happen if the game was ever going to be released. I am amazed however how smoothly the game plays out having played through it now with three different save game imports. Bioware have done a superlative job in simply getting a coherent story out of two games worth (70 hours worth) of loose threads, and should be commended for their efforts. Secondly plot has developed in line with the popular hero trend. If you want your hero",9,2012-07-08,PC,user

scifi_lover,"As a stand alone game, it was mediocre at best. As the 3rd installment in a trilogy, if failed in almost every way possible. Your character is no longer yours but a forced character by BW. Autodialog forces conversations in directions that go against the players choices. Boring, uninspired fetch quests inundate the game. Exceptionally linear in design, unlike the pseudo-free style of the previous games. Endings that nothing to smile about and everything to hate. Infused with massive, game breaking, space magic. Overall, a childish attempt at ending a trilogy. Not worth the purchase price.",2,2012-07-07,PC,user

AidanByrne,"The entire game focuses on a story which doesn't relate to Me and ME2 very well. Most missions you do come across as tacked in just to add gameplay hours, at least 3 Deus Ex Machina plot points (We don't have a cure for the **** we do now; How can we know what the catalyst is? Hey, there's prothean beacon over there! Reapers cannot be defeated. There's a thing called crucible, no one knows what it is or what it does, but hey, it's big! Must work!), and many more senseless things happening. Also, using cerberus as villains was simply a **** cop out for enemies, and they ruined TIM in the process, turning the ""ultimate renegade"" into a deranged power hungry maniac. It's just sad how they handled ME2 characters, especially when romanced. The gameplay flows a bit soother than ME2, but it still has rather stupid cover mechanics. Also in the gameplay, the auto-dialog... Probably the worst idea they could have! Now, to the endings... Well, it is said that if a part of the story feels completely out of place, it can be disregarded from the plot so logically, the game ends before the companions are picked up by the Normandy during harby's nap time, therefore, I'm still waiting for the endings.",3,2012-07-06,PC,user

I invested to much time and money on the series, only for it to be sabotaged by EA and their minions. I loved the mass effect universe, it got me through tough times, it meant a lot to me, I know that sounds gay but its true, The first two games hit the right buttons for me. But now I feel worse.

roboticsun,"Mass Effect 3 is a well made experience to say the least. The overall combat action is very fast and fluid though there are quite a few animation glitches here and there but aren't serious enough to ruin things. The six basic classes are played differently, so the combat itself had replay values. The enemy AI are improved a bit but still feels weak most time. The pause function really ruined this game imo which made this single player game rather easy. The story is epic in scope compare to the previous two entries but some new plots are not well explained. I wont put spoilers here, but the game indeed will confuse you if you ever played the first two mass effect games. the newly released extended cut added more explanations, though I do not feel it helped **** playable characters are significantly reduced compare to mass effect 2 which leads to a shorter story line. the playable contents in single player part are noticeably less than those in mass effect 2. you should be able to finish most single player contents in 30~35 hours. However, the game did add a quite fun multilayer portion to compensate the shorter single player game. there are lots of unlockables in multilayer, so it should keep you busy for one or two months. despite the flaws, I still would say mass effect 3 is a very solid game combining fun combat, epic storyline and interactive cinema. It's still a memorable adventure and a must play for people who loved storytelling in video games.",8,2012-07-04,PC,user

I cannot understand why EA take companies such as Bioware, who have been immensely successful in the past, and absolutely rip the creativity from them. The ending is disgustingly inaccurate to the rest of the series (no surprise thanks to the 1 million writer changes), and gameplay seems to be a child's interpretation of the previous games, the graphics seem half done thanks to all the cartoony looks on humans, and the game in genral, ABSOLUTE FILTH.

Dheu,"So, I share the same gripe that everyone else has with ME3: it only has 3 endings. And by 3 endings I mean 1 ending with 3 different color overlays. Red, green and blue. Now the 1 ending is fine, but I was expecting no less than 6 distinct endings and frankly I was hoping for more like 9 or 12 given all the hype over how our choices would impact the end. But no, all those choices culminate in 1 ending with 3 color overlays... That said, ME3 is a great game. Graphics are great, story is great, the soundtrack is excellent. It has in depth character development and ties up all the loose ends. You will meet all the (surviving) characters from the first two episodes and help them out at least one more time. It will make you smile, laugh and cry... or at least look really solemn. The game does NOT deserve a score less than 5 from anyone. It is a shining example of the kind of games the industry should be producing and deserves your vote and purchase. How the user score on this is lower than the likes of Alan Wake or Duke Nukem Forever is beyond me.

If you read into the indoctrination theory and follow the correct ending you will probably see the ending as one of the greatest ending's of all time.

lordythegreat,"The main problem with mass effect three compared to the last two is that all these decisions, all those player deaths, all those events and consequences that you have caused to happen in the lead up to this game, most of them seem to have very little final impact on the finale (which was rubbish btw). some plot lines just plain dont make sense (The reapers, a killing race of machines, were sent to destroy us because in the future we would create a race of machines that would end mankind. um wtf?!?!) the build up to the last few battles was nigh on brilliant, all the characthers you fall in love (or hate) with have their fitting stories and some fitting conclusions, but then the final battles and final outcome takes all of those stories, completely discards and disregards them and gives you a supposedly ""artistic"" end sequence. again i call bs, its a cop out, its like the script writers went on strike for the last month of development so they called in a college psych student to finish it off. I wasnt angry the night i finished it, but sleeping on it i woke up really p-off. the combat is improved from number two, and the multiplayer is a nice touch if lacking any real depth, i would say it feels like an experiment rather than a key part of the game. You will find yourself in some explosive chaotic moments that hold you on the edge of your seat, which is great, but the final pay off is just a big nothing, could be the worst ending to a game since metal gear solid 2. In conclusion, its a great end to the series BUT it sacrifices great rpg elements for third person shooting elements that gears of war did better. To add insult to injury bioware is now making dlc to change the ending. So... is that an admittance of failure on your part Bioware? cheers bro",6,2012-06-23,PC,user
AgeofLeon,"Mass effect as a trilogy is by far one of the better action RPGs out there. Mass effect 3 is an excellent addition to it, though its ending may leave you feeling unsatisfied. You play as Commander Shepard, on a quest to save the galaxy from the Reapers, who are these ancient synthetic aliens hell bent on wiping out all organic life. It's a shooter RPG, and while the gameplay is quite nice especially compared to earlier mass effect editions, the heart and soul of this game is not in its gameplay but in its story and characterization. You'll care about your squad members in a way you wouldn't in other games. You'll actually want to know what happens to them. This is bioware's strength: creating games with characters you actually like and want to know more about. For most of the game and especially the Tuchanka mission, the game is an absolute blast. It is more challenging than Mass effect 1 and 2 in a good way, and they've removed the distracting mini games. There has been much written about Mass effect 3's ending and for good reason, if you are like the majority you will wonder what the hell happened. Its ending is not its strength, but don't let that dissuade you. It's mostly a really great game. To get the most out of it, I highly recommend playing mass effect 1 and 2 first, as your choices will carry over into 3 and make it that much more meaningful.",9,2012-06-22,PC,user
TheTypeOfGuy,"Mass Effect 3 was the worst game in the series. While Multiplayer was a nice addition, i think that the singleplayer suffered a lot. Most time there are only two choices (the middle option is missing, except in some parts), the journal system got worse from me2 to 3 (how can that happen?), no vehicle exploration or little mini games and to much Auto-Dialog (Story- and RPG-Mode). Now lets go to the multiplayer. The matchmaking is the worst I have ever seen and the anti-cheating system is overly sensitive (Everyone can report someone and he gets banned even he didnt do anything. Happend to me 2 times already. Had to report these mistakes and got to play multiplayer again). The good Aspects of the Game are that the dialog with your squadmates are unique and funny. You could have though BioWare looked directly into the souls of the fans. Some Missions were so unique and awesome (Tuchanka for example) that it could have redeemed BioWare for all those bad aspects. But the one thing that is the worst piece of yeah i think you know what i mean are these super intelligence-insulting endings. With that ending and the bad aspect of the game bioware not only ruined its reputation but lost a lot of (good) fans. I'd rate this game minus (over)9000 but because of some awesome moments i rate it with good will a 2 out of 10. BioWare please take these critism to heart and change while you still can!

Amig,"A weak ending to a promising series. It had it's moments, but the absurd finale and overall low budget feel of the game kill it completely. Gameplay-wise it's still a linear third person shooter with subtle cRPG elements like exp, skill points and minor dialogue choices. The combat isn't as dull as it was in the previous game, but it's still not enough to keep you from falling asleep during some of the longer firefights. The new teammates we recieved were rather uninteresting too, especially when compared to the weirdos we had to put up with in ME2 (Jack, Legion, Mordin, Thane...). On the other hand, Shepard himself seems a little more human and less BA, which is an improvement. Still, in the end the only thing that keeps this game alive is the multiplayer mode, which doesn't get boring quite as soon as one would think.

Based on the huge numbers of negative reviews I came very close to passing this game by, but I'm glad I gave it a try. It is a whole lot better than people have been saying. Good graphics, good crisp game action along with well developed characters and story. The game allows you to import saves from of the prior verisons and the decisions you made in those games play important parts in this game. Over all this is a hybrid action shooter coupled with RPG elements. The Biotic and powers have the role of magic systems in similar games. I've been reading that many folks have had problems with the ending, but I believe the most important thing is if the game is fun to play and does it drag you into the story so you care about the characters, your decisions and the outcome of the war. In fact, the decisions and consequences in this game are much more difficult and far reaching than in the other two, a fact that has caused me to replay missions I'd already won because I couldn't get comfortable with the moral decisions I'd made. Anyway, don't pass this game by you will be sorry.

ZaPaAl,"I have not been a fan of Bioware since the Dragon Age 2 disaster or the ME series. Especially ME 2 with it's nerve wrecking harvesting, story unlikeliness and blank environments had me building up high levels of denial against it. But i just had to see the ending in ME 3, and i'm glad i did. I regard ME 3 as the best part of the series, it's good enough to compensate for all the flaws and drags in the previous 2 parts. Few Games today have such high quality and enjoable amount of content. To some minor extent i can even understand the weak last minute DLC ripping. POSITIVE: Believable Story that makes you play along, interesting Dialogs, strong Atmosphere, Gameplay is fun (played as Vanguard), nice and smooth visuals. Good difficulty on normal (being careless get's you killed). NEUTRAL: It does need a few tweaks to get it in shape, check the ME wiki on how to. 6x speed for scenes and walking really can make a difference. It's not an RPG and shouldn't be marketed as one. Weapons are interesting, but most of the them are pretty much alike. Personally i found myself always coming back to the particle rifle. Nothing overly new, just a perfect wrapping up of the universe they created. Some low textures now and then, but nothing really disturbing. NEGATIVE: A few more customization options for armor would have been nice, currently I'd regard them as mainly cosmetic. Character relation's were a bit of focus this time. It had to end, and i would have preferred a stronger and more personal ending, but honestly i'm ok with it. Large scale problems do call for uncompromising solutions.",9,2012-06-10,PC,user

After all false statements in advertisements used to deceive the customers and generate more sales isn't considered artistic integrity, it is called fraud. Bioware spent months to explain that in Mass Effect 3 our choices will shape the world, and as they don't plan to continue the story, we can get very different endings. The world can be very very different based on our choices. In the end, our choices didn't matter. Lack of choice and strange ending alone wouldn't be a problem. After all we know stories of games can't be perfect and the last 3 minutes aren't that important. We are free to imagine any different ending as the story won't continue. Who cares? And the game was fun until that point. The problem is: The game was a let down, because Bioware lied to us, deceived us. And after a huge let down, players can be disappointed and it can turn the gameplay experience sour and can remove any replay value. This feeling isn't here for 5 minutes at end, it is here the whole time we try to replay the game, would try our luck in multiplayer, etc. As long as EA doesn't understand that we buy games because we want to have fun, and being angry at a publisher and feeling anger whenever you see an EA game can ruin the fun. If you ignore what Bioware has promised, buy the game now, it won't be a disappointment. But otherwise even good graphics, entertianing gameplay, etc. wouldn't redeem the issue about ending and forced multiplayer farming. So the game doesn't deserve a ""Better than mixed"" rating.

I've heard that the team's ""artistic integrity"" has to be preserved, so they won't change the ending, although I did expect a new DLC. There are different problems with this game, starting from its movement away from ME 1 and its RPG style and ending with the numbers to signify your military strength.

JohnnyBeGood,"As far as combat goes, this is the best, cleanest, most fluid Mass Effect yet. I would say that it is the best 3rd person game I've ever played, combat and control wise. Story wise, it is easily the worst. The game lacks the bonding with the characters that Mass Effect 2 contained. The dialogue is mostly poor. We have all heard the gripes about the ending. To have an ""A, B, and C"" choice to end a game based on countless Paragon and Renegade endings is offensive. It's clear to me Bioware wanted to wrap up the series. It seems like they really rished it, even though they had a huge amount of time to work on it. The multiplayer is surprisingly enjoyable, and t made even better when played with friends. The countless unlockables are a nice touch, and free map packs are quite amazing. However, smooth gameplay and captivating multiplayer are not enough to save the game from its deplorable story. This is made worse when you remember that the reason you play a Mass Effect game is for the story. There's even a ""narrative"" difficulty setting for the campaign that tones the enemies' difficulty down to as though they are being controlled by toddlers. Overall, the game is worth a buy for die hard fans, but you'll end up trading it in after a few weeks.

elhive,"The way people are talking about Mass effect 3 seems harsh. I believe the game was just as good as the second,while the first being more of a classic then it's sequals. The dialog was excellent and on the same level with the second game, I would say. The moral choices are also very appealing and varied, and it feels like the stakes are higher with each choice you make because,well, the entire living galactic population is on the verge of annihilation. The gameplay elements are mostly identical to mass effect 2's which means the game plays very intense and spactacular. People might complain that the characters don't offer as much variety and quality in the dialoge but I dissagree. Most of these characters have already made their full appearance in the last games, so you can't really expand too much on more then established characters(like Garrus, for example). The plot is very cinematic and the game feels like a giant dramatic Sci-fi movie that always keeps you on your toes. The major problem people have with this game is the ending. At first I felt the same;I thought this ending is ridiculous, but as I looked in the internet, I saw a brilliant explenation to that odd and unfulfilling ending. I won't give out spoilers but I think the entire game seems a lot more clear when you see it in the right angle. This game is fantastic, it truly is.

Xehlwan,"On the surface, Mass Effect 3 is a worthy sequel to a great trilogy. It has amazing cinematic scenes, while still letting you control the action. It brought back a good amount of customization and upgrades for your party. It even tells some really good - if somewhat overly dramatic - stories. After the amazement over the brilliant touches of returning characters and story-progression from the previous games calms down, some problems start to show. First, you will start to realize that the game is even more linear than ever. Sure, some missions are ""optional"" - that is if you don't mind getting worse endings for your story arcs. Side-quests have been reduced to small text pop-ups when you survey the correct planet, and side-stories are almost exclusively put in chunks of text in your log. The grand main campaign has obviously forced the developers to cut corners on other content, but the main story is presented beautifully. Until the last moments of the game. Some 10-15 minutes before the game ends, all semblance of a coherent story is thrown out the window. What remains is a convoluted mess of a ""final revelation"", with plot-holes the size of Alaska, and forced choices you have no interest in making. All of which ends in a final movie, which at the core doesn't care about your choices - or even about making any sort of sense. You may enjoy the ride, but the ending to this epic trilogy will leave you with a sour taste.",1,2012-06-01,PC,user
Etrute,"Tight controls, beautiful environments, and fluent combat all make ME3 what it is today, a success. The storyline too makes it a beautifully written book. The largest issue to the ""mob"" seems to be a lackluster ending, an increadibly small price to play considering the 30 hours i'v put into each game in the series (plus the 60 extra hours from playing two other characters on varying difficulties). Considering all the choices made throughout four games, what the hell did people expect? Turian Strippers and Quarian supremecy? For those of you not stuck up on the Single Player, the multiplayer too has lots of fun to be had. Like short war stories one holds the line and moves forward with valid team combat. The idea that Bioware didn't innovate or expand on the original two is amusing, If they had picked any ending beside the one in now, it would be flamed. If They had everyone wear special hats, it would be flamed. The biggest issue i have with the game is the lack of a Mako, it made the game a bit more interesting, stumbling around in the universe in your own casket-box and being quite suprised when you see your first Maw.",9,2012-06-01,PC,user

The rest of the game however is epic, enjoyable and a testament to what made this series so great, which further compounds the failure of the final chapter.

Gil8ert,"Feels more like an expansion than a standalone game which is why I'm giving it a 7. However, I very much enjoyed it, just as I enjoyed Mass Effect 2. It reminds me very much of He-man the cartoon I watched as I was growing up because you do get a lot of morality spat in your face which, whilst at the time can come across as patronising and vomit inducing, actually fleshes out the experience. For the most part you are asked to make decisions which generally don't affect how the game will play, but everynow and then you are faced with making a hum-dinger of a choice which is where Mass Effect always excels. Most games require a simple choice of this or that which doesn't affect the outcome all that much, but here you are faced with choices between entire races which feel like big decisions to make and you might be thinking about the choice for a couple of minutes. And **** can cause you to pause and think about the consequences of what you're doing for more than a nano-second then it has done good! The game itself is really more about living the story than it is being technically proficient, and I don't remember dying at any point - although I probably did. But if I did then it was only once or twice so it wasn't particulalry challenging. It did feel a little dumbed down from ME2. But for me it was a fine ending to the franchise. Not great, but fine. I would still recommend the whole lot to any gamer out there as an excellent example of an immersive experience.",7,2012-05-28,PC,user

I was so impressed with Mass effect 2's dynamic play, control, featres and RPG type feel to your players, I was certain that ME3 would be that much **** its not. ME2 you could mine minerals off various planets and solar systems, giving you a feel of control and power, but now, you need to dogde aliens from destroying whilest you basically collect 1 item, if you are lucky from some random planet. The gameplay is very much the same as ME2, altough not a bad thing, it was not enhanced, just the same with slightly different damages.... The story feels more scripted then before too.

joem282,"I am sorely disappointed by this game. For the past five years, I have enjoyed shaping one of the most engrossing, and exceptionally written Sci-Fi franchise of all time. Not only were each of the individual Mass Effect games exceptional in their own unique ways in terms of gameplay, but they also had an extraordinary storyline that held true to canon even as the player's choices shaped them. This made for an extremely immersive gameplay experience that can be rivaled by few others. This also applies to 99% of the third entry to the Mass Effect series. While I find the first Mass Effect unique because of the sense of discovery and mysteries of the galaxy (much like Star Trek) and the second Mass Effect had a unique focus on the development of your crew and pretty good action; the third Mass Effect was unique because it was a story, an emotional and inspiring story that had been crafted personally to you based off of your actions in the third game. The over-the-top action that would make most third person shooters titles weep was a nice bonus, as well (this is in an RPG to top it off). But, to be honest, I am going to skip past the majority of the details of the game and get right to the part that affected this review's rating the most- the terrible ending. When I heard the game's ending was bad, I could have never imagined as terrible of an ending to a game, let alone the ending of an entire series, especially the Mass Effect series. To avoid spoilers, I won't go into too much detail as to the ending, but it was bad! Plot holes, circular logic, explanations pulled out of thin air and a horrific WTF moment destroy what would have been one of the best games of all times and inadvertently destroy the entire Mass Effect series. The ending doesn't even reflect a single choice you made throughout the series, NOT A SINGLE CHOICE. One could even say that the ending make the events of the first game entirely moot. I didn't want this ending, I wanted closure based off of my decisions throughout the series, you know, like the last two games. In summary, the game was epic, including the final battles. Sure there were flaws here and there, but most of them could be overlooked, up till the last 10-15 minutes of the game of course. I never thought that 15 minutes could dismantle over a hundred hours of gameplay spanning three games, not until I played Mass Effect 3",2,2012-05-27,PC,user

aleyas,"For those new to series, ME3 as a stand alone game is probably not bad, though without playing ME1-2 it's rather difficult to understand multiple references to earlier series events. But again, if to play with pressing SPACE all the time to skip dialogues to short cut to action - then neither story no its end matter and you have only to worry about some bugs and your character refusing to move properly according to your commands from time to time. But I used to be a ME series fan and I was playing and paying for entertainment I was getting. I have started with ME2 and soon dropped it for a while to play ME1 first and then returned to replay ME2 for better ending. And I was ready to replay ME3 to get desired outcome. And here comes not only ingame issue with linear plot and bad joke devastating ending - but also an ethical issue with Bioware managers publically lying to users, encouraging them to play and replay by assuring them that it's possible to achieve higher scores necessary for a secret ending without myltiplayer. Which is not true. But people believed, why should not have they - it worked like this in ME2. And purchased and played and replayed. And then the stupid ending itself, promised to be variable, not a display of RGB colour model. Amazing how Boiware been building its loyal userbase for 5 years managed to ruin the best RPG franchise in one go acting as if there was no tomorrow and the only thing important was to make people buy the copy of the game regardless. No apologises, no explanation, quite the contrary...Looks like Bioware regards its users as a cattle which exists only to be soothen with **** if necessry and milked.",3,2012-05-25,PC,user
Gr33nF00t,"I will begin with this: Mass Effect 3 had so much potential. All throughout the game, there are moments of beauty and brilliance, such as the ""Leaving Earth"" sequence. I heard how this game was terrible; a huge let down; a major blow to video games as a narrative medium. And for 96% of the game I thought to myself ""What are these people talking about?"" I really liked it; I felt like I was steam-rolling towards the proper conclusion of my Shep. Then the ending happened. It was like watching the U.S. theatrical cut of Blade Runner. Roy gives the ""Tears in rain"" speech, releases the dove, and dies; and right when you are reaching cerebral climax, Deckard's clumsy voice-over enters your ear-holes to completely ruin your moment like a drunken man-child. ME3's ending by and large completely ignores all the choices you made throughout the previous games. On top of that, all the endings are the EXACT SAME. Sure, there are some very minor differences, but there is no meaningful variation among endings. There is no closure, no denouement. I could go on, but I will instead end with this: Were it not for the terribly handled ending this game would be a 10 in my book.",8,2012-05-24,PC,user
aburnstorm,"This is a truly superb computer game. I admit that I am often very critical of story-telling, character arcs, plots, game-play. I don't have much free time and have to spend it wisely. In addition, I'm not particularly intrigued by Sci-Fi. For all of these reason (and especially after reading the reviews here), I thought I'd better not play this game. I did finally purchase it, however, and have to say that this game was in quite a few ways superior to either Mass Effect 1 or 2 (which I also played recently). I think the philosophy of the ending options are sound and faithful to the overall story arch. It is in fact better thought out than countless other Sci-Fi story endings. The characters are superb, their motivations are typically clear, their dialogue is often hilarious. In short, if more pulp Sci-Fi novels were as good as this game, I'd probably read more of them. I have never spent the time to review a game before on this or really any site, but I am reviewing this game based on the fact that so many people wrote such hate for this game. I cannot account for it and thought I'd add my two cents of response. Buy this game and enjoy it. It deserves a much higher rating than it has received.",10,2012-05-24,PC,user
yrogerg123,"I actually find it pretty absurd that ME3 gets as much hate as it does. It's different from the first two games, but in no way is it worse. There is less emphasis on inventory, less emphasis on fetch quests, and those are not bad things. I certainly don't miss hacking minigames, and I definitely don't miss mining. ME3 cuts out the stuff that was unnecessary, improves on the core elements, and the result is a very good installment to a great series. The story is focused but creative and you are moving towards the ultimate goal at all times. As with all ME games, the scale of the game is impressive. In ME3 there is much less emphasis on sidequests, which is good because I always got the feeling I was up against the clock and didn't need to be running around doing favors for people you barely know. You constantly feel like what you are doing is important, like it needs to be done and you're the only one who can do it. ""Do this so my species' army will stand beside you"" just makes a lot more sense than do this so you can have some credits/move one step closer to 100% completion. And the gameplay: it's awesome. Vast improvement over any other installment. It plays not just like a shooter, but like a very good shooter. It stands alone as one of the best FPS games I've ever played. Coupled with the elements that make ME great, like the character interactions and the story, and you have a near flawless game. Of course, the ending is horrendous, but I played through the game in 25 hours and the last twenty minutes doesn't undo everything that came before it. This is a great, great game, and I find it sort of baffling that the general consensus is that it's not a great game. It deserves to be thought of in the same ways as the first two. The series evolved as it went along, but again, that's not a bad thing. As much as I enjoy being able to wander around aimlessly looking for things to do, sometimes a game benefits from cutting out the time wasters and sticking to the core story that it is trying to tell. That is exactly what ME3 did, and it did it well.",9,2012-05-24,PC,user

X19,"Who knew 15 minutes could turn a game worthy of a 9 drop down to a 4? It's ridiculous as this game deserves so much more. I have never felt so emotionally connected to a video game before this. I actually cared about the characters. I was on the brink of tears at one point and I'm not one who cries easily. Mass Effect 3 has always been about the characters for me. ME2 really brought this into full scale. It's one thing to go up against a seemingly invincible force, but it's another to do it with people you feel you would care about and even die for. I won't spoil more, but if you want the best possible experience; I recommend going through the first two games before this one. Gameplay has always seemed an afterthought in Bioware games, but it's not disregarded here. You feel like a complete bad*** when you stride through the field of battle sliding over cover and occasionally rolling into cover when hurt, all the while shooting at menacing foes who do not fear death or pain. The way Shepard holds his pistol is pretty awkward looking, especially in the first part of the game, but that's it. Finally, the ending. What did I think? I thought it was terrible. It made no sense whatsoever. It defiled all logic and everything you fought for. It just seemed like a marketing stunt by EA for expansions and sequels. Did it ruin all those hours I put into ME1 and 2? Absolutely not. I didn't regret a single second of my time spent in this game or it's predecessors. Would I buy ME4? No, Bioware did screw up with the ending. Even if the indoctrination theory were true, the ending is total nonsense. Play the other games, buy this one, but stop at the point when Shepard levitates up into the ending. (You'll know it when you see it.) Quit game and draw your own conclusions. That's the best way to experience this game.",9,2012-05-22,PC,user
lbtaylor1984,"I'm a little late to the party, but I wished to give a unbiased view of the last instalment of one the best series in modern gaming. I played through ME1, ME2 and pulled my saves over before beginning ME3 Mass Effect 3 suffers from some over sights and issues surrounding its storytelling. There are now time based missions which your never informed of how long you've got, but with fairness to Bioware while annoying probably more accurately represents the galaxy this time round as the Reapers have returned so worlds are falling on a daily basis so missions disappear as the reapers strike, or world situations change. On the subject of worlds scanning planets has changed to a radar pulse from the ship which attracts Reaper attention, while the side missions of merc bases, crash ships etc from ME1 and ME2 have almost completely disappeared, exploration this time has been severely reduced, un fortunately this was one of the merits of Mass Effect that is was a RPG shooter with exploration, your railroaded into following the story with very little room to manoeuvre in the traditional role of exploration, while i'd like to do this with the current state of the Galaxy you'd be hard pressed to be wasting time exploring. The combat system is improved but the streamlined controls seemed to have made setup of hotbars impossible, this i found frustrating in heavy combat as the hotbar layout isn't how i'd have it setup, a minor point but another change to the series. other than that it plays better than previous games, and your loadout of weapons affects your ability cooldown timers, interesting idea as it makes you think about the weapons you need, upposed to taking everything, you also rely on squad mates taking the weapons you don't (you can take everything but your cooldown as twice as long.) Story wise Bioware have yet again told a interesting, compelling, and in some respects a very emotional story. My first playthrough I lost friends along the way, and the Voice acting in my opinion was some of the best in the series, those familiar with the series know of the romance options and the romance I had between Shepard and Ashley was truely believable, from the dilogue to the way it was read by the actor, when you loose friends you felt the loss rather than just seeing it, some made me question my decisions. However this brings up one of the flaws that bothered me probably the most in ME3. the dialogue options in alot of situations seemed a little short and didn't cover the questions properly while other times the options simply wouldn't be what I as shepard would have said, there is a particular area of the game, I won't mention that is quite pivotal in the plot and you can mention it to your Love Interest, but they response with one line in a dismissive response, bearing in mind it's relation to the plot it just feels rushed and not fleshed out as needed, infact it would partially explain the end.. Don't let this put you off though the gameplay is good and the commentary is excellent between you and the crew, it just feels some points weren't fully realised by Bioware, or simply pushed through by EA Games. Choice from previous Games DO MATTER. Regardless of what people have posted, many things you have done in previous games effect the current game, did you keep the Genophage data from Maelon in ME2? that changes things, did you Romance Ashley in ME1 but someone in ME2 as well? it changes things, does it totally rewrite the story? No. but with this game closing the story on Mass Effect and Shepard it's hard to follow all paths as the ending simply wouldn't be the ending they wrote in fact you'd need about 40 endings to cover it. and you can't really conclude Mass Effect with that regardless of how we feel, if you had 40 endings. The Ending; I'm not going to ruin it for you, play it youself make your own decision, but it is the opinion on most that when you finally get to the white light into the sky (vague enough) you should shut the game down, and just agree you won and the Reapers lost. The end gameplay is in serious question from long time fans including myself, with a few theories on what actually happened. Bioware have promised free DLC to explain the ending but that should give you a sign of how poorly put together it is. The last 5 minutes ruins probably one of the best gaming series to have been created. I give a 7/10 as the exploration and dialogue options has diminished the Mass Effect universe in this release, while the Story (up til the white light into the sky) and the emotional bond with your team are truly the best of the series, combat is the best of the three as is the graphics.",7,2012-05-22,PC,user

benny0909,"What was the one thing that made Mass Effect unique. It wasn't explosions, or multiplayer. It was the dialogue wheel. It is so streamlined in ME3 that the story more or less goes on regardless of what decisions you make. Your decisions over the past 2 installments meant nothing. The earth mission was very underwhelming as you don't see any of the assets you have been working for in action. The last 10 minutes ruined the entire series. The starchild needs to be removed entirely or the extended cut will not satisfy the fans. Why is he the antagonist when harbinger has been interacting with shepard all throughout ME2? Just makes no sense...Ending needs to be completely redone, ruined everything....",1,2012-05-21,PC,user

CrashOverride,"It's an OK game on its own, but easily the worst of all three games. The models look terrible and the animations are clumsy (why do they keep rolling their eyes all the way up?).

Naherven,"Mass Effect 3 can best be summed up in one sentence; a slap in the face to fans. Major decisions made in previous Mass Effect games barely matter, as the story either glazes over or outright replaces player-made choices. Neutral choices seem to be absent from most dialog, removing a lot of the Role-playing from the Role-playing game. Renegade choices, which were mostly a Machiavellian ""ends justify the means"", ""I did what I had to do"" mindset in previous games, now come off as just plain, absurdly evil decisions with no real justification. The pacing is bottom-tier as well. The opening level, which is supposed to be an amazing, exciting scene is reduced to a railed tutorial level. Scenes, which try to depict Shepard as suffering from the stresses of saving the galaxy, come off as hilariously bad, as if written by someone who had never heard of the proper definition of PTSD. Strangely enough, there are some beautifully-written, tear-inducing missions and scenes, scattered about the rest of the game, making the overall experience feel very jarring. As many, many other people have stated. the ending is just god-awful. It feels incredibly rushed and (without spoiling much) adds a Deus Ex Machina from nowhere, watering down any possible chance at a well-written, open ended ending and ending up with an ""A"", ""B"" or ""C"" cookie-cutter end. It's incredibly sad to think that most Creative Writing 101 students could come up with a better ending than what Bioware and Hudson pulled. The most ironic part seems to be that, of all things, the multiplayer is the most enjoyable part of a supposed RPG game, as the multiplayer is surprisingly well-made and has a high replay value. Being an idealistic man, I honestly hope that Bioware didn't mean to make the game as bad as it was. I hope that the ending was so poorly-written, so incredibly bad because EA demanded the game meet a very exacting deadline, causing parts that required great care and thought to be sloppily churned out. But with Bioware and others scoffing at fans' disapproval, labeling it as just ""whiners"" or ""a vocal minority"" and Bioware planning to release ""Ending DLC"" not to retcon the atrocity of an ending, but to ""clarify"" it makes me lose any hope of seeing this injustice made against the fans, the story, the RPG genre, the medium, and the art of story writing as a whole from ever being rectified.",3,2012-05-20,PC,user
John117,"This game was a huge disappointment. The combat was boring, the story was terrible, and the ending essentially ruined the previous two games for me. Mass effect 2 was dumbed down from ME1, but it was still a pretty good game. This one takes it ten steps further. ""Action mode"" says it all. The graphics are worse as well, many of the landscapes look blocky, the water looks **** list goes on. I don't know what happened, if some of the better writers left between games, but the story in this one is cringe-worthy at every turn with few exceptions. I'd have rather this game had not even came out, which is saying a lot since I'd been looking forward to this conclusion of commander Shepard's story for the past 5 years or so. Don't buy this game.",0,2012-05-20,PC,user

Metalock,I don't care about Day 1 DLC issues or how bad Origin is. The point is this game is fun.

NDMania,"-------STORY 9.0------- This is one of the few games in which talking about the quality of the game's story instead of the trilogy doesn't make sense. If anyone plays this game without having played the previous 2 games... they're doing it wrong! The story plot is amazingly well written and really makes you care for your followers, it has what most games don't: It **** you into the world of Mass Effect turning it into a Star Wars of the Gaming Industry. Definitely not a game for children, not that it has too much violence or strong language, but because it's really emotional, the difficult choices you made until this game will hunt you down and will be reflected on the game's direction. What made the fans so mad was the fact that these choices don't affect the end of the game. Being a renegade or a paragon player the ending is always the same, not that the game developers don't have the right to control the ending but at least the decisions should be reflect in a more intense way. Instead of being a whole, the plot of ME3 is divided in individual smaller plots that don't connect with each other, being the final one only related to Shepard and the fate of the universe. -------SOUND: 10.0------- More than in the previous games, the soundtrack binds you to the game in such a strong way that makes this game one of the best games I've ever played. With time I've come to notice the importance of music and sound effects in movies but even more in games. It's subtle, but it's the final and most important connection between the game and the gamer. The soundtrack doesn't need to be good while listening to it separately, it wasn't made with that intention, it was made to emphasize the emotions or even create them for a more realist and/or dramatic way. A true piece or art. -------GAMEPLAY: 8.0------- I wouldn't say it's just another shooter, cause it isn't, since you have that interaction with your teammates, special abilities (aka biotic powers), etc... it's just that it could be better, I really don't know what to write. The cover system is better but still with some problems, the existence of the heavy melee attack and over-the-cover melee gives a cool and rapid-pace feeling to the game as well as brutal, but it alone doesn't change much, I think the best new addition to the gameplay was the roll / evade move, that really lets you go all-out in a stylish way against your enemies. In non-combat situations the game gets too rpg for my taste, not that I don't mind making little errands but, specially in this game where the fate of earth is in your hands, chilling out in a bar may not be the best idea. In conclusion, you can play the game for fun as well as for interest in the story plot. -------GRAPHICS: 7.5------- Good, solid, could be better in humans, much better... It's OK for me but it's not what makes the game pop out. Don't get me wrong, though. I think it's a little better than in the previous games as it should be. -------ART-WORK: 9.5------- This is a special note that I don't think I'll be using in future reviews, but I bought the Art work book of ME3, and it is amazing. It really shows the readers the Universe and it's every detail, it shows what the players don't see while running through the lands of Tuchanka (for example...) it's really revealing. It's those things that make the game big. I really can't understand it fully but it's really impressive. Thanks for that Bioware. -------CONCLUSION------- For anyone who hasn't played it yet... please, for your own good... buy the Mass Effect games. It's a generation, it's a MUST-HAVE",9,2012-05-19,PC,user
strangel0ve,"this game was like a bad movie, you follow, step by step, the cheap storyline. theres even an option to disable choosing dialogues which tells you how important your decisions are in this game apart from the action, which is fun it's achingly dull.",4,2012-05-19,PC,user
wolfmantto,"I've read all the reviews here and I must say, I'm agreeing with the guys in the middle. Mass Effect 1 was a strong opener. Yea the movements of the NPC's became old rather quick, the dialog was good, not amazing but good. Some conversations were very well done, such as the one with Sovereign. A very expansive world was offered to the people as well. You would drop on planets and moons, ride around in your little mako tank, and even get to jump off a cliff once in a while. Not to mention all the stunning ruins they implemented. The combat system was lack-luster, however. The new system in Mass Effect 2 was (in my opinion) that games single redeeming quality. Now Mass Effect 2 was honestly the weakest installment of the series. The expansive universe you were able to explore in its predecessor was completely cut out. You also lose the ability to really customize... anything. Your weapons are all cookie cutter, and ammunition is now an ability instead of a mod to your weapon. Though the designers had succeeded in expanding the dialog, they were unable to capture the sense of camaraderie you had in the ME1. I will, however, note that his game included peril at the end. If you hadn't interacted with your companions throughout the game, they die during the final mission. Now onto our current topic, Mass Effect 3. ME3 was most certainly the cleanest of the games in graphics no argument there. Yet somehow Bio Ware managed to ruin the entire story for its players. None of the major (and I stress major, minor decisions influence the game only slightly) decisions you made in the past two installments really matter unfortunately. Udina still ends up being the councilor, Cerberus is still a thorn in your side, and saving the council in the first game has 0 impact whatsoever. Its sad honestly. This release was truly disappointing. The new battle system in ME2 was shifted to play more like the Gears of War franchise. It was a clumsy adaptation. Secondly, the downgrading of the grenades for the solider. The old grenades would glide on the air in the direction you tossed them. Perfectly futuristic. The new grenades work the same as... well... short range Halo grenades. You will also notice some rather frustratingly lazy decisions throughout the game. In my mind, the most noticeable one is when your on Thesea. The mission where you are sent to the Asari home world to retrieve a prothean artifact is what I'm mentioning here. You might recognize that little green V.I. when you are working that mission. To my surprise, they didn't go out of their way to make something prothean in nature. Instead, they used the same model as the combat drone and Liara's little helper drone. Its truly sad to see a fantastic game degenerate into something so... mediocre. Though Lets not forget the Pro's of ME3. We do have a multiplayer mode now, allowing the game to have real value to a larger audience. Not to cut my little Pro section short but, I believe it may have had a negative effect on the game as a whole unfortunately. Next, we can customize our guns again. Though ammunition is still class specific in story mode, and temporary in multiplayer, the guns we use are not from a cookie cutter. I miss my plunonium rounds... Next we get our old crew back, mostly. I wasn't largely into the new crew other than Thane and Jack, the only interesting members of the new crew in my opinion. Next, we have a larger citadel. Though not as wondrous as that beautiful place we had all the way back in ME1, its not the joke you were handed in ME2. Finally, we get to play with a real prothean, and learn about their past if nothing else. (It is DLC). Overall, this game deserves a solid 6/10. You improved from the filler that was ME2, but failed to meet the Majesty of ME1. I've played the entire series, and I must say, for the first time with the newer games I've played, ME3 fails to live up to the very first game in the series.",6,2012-05-19,PC,user

Hybridiction,"This is the score the game actually deserves. Now before you down-vote me, you will find if you average around the fifty + critic scores the game received it would be around the 89-93 area. Take off the moronic user score feature metacritic, it is used as a tool by a bunch of forum trolls and butthurt fanboys who really have no clue how to review a game. Of course this review will be down-voted by them, and I'll probably be called a ""**** up"" to the gaming media, but let's look at the facts first. High expectations almost always lead to disappointment, and those who have insanely high expectations will always be disappointed. This is why when you look at a game objectively, or rather as it is, instead of what you wanted it to be, you would find that it truly is a good game. Whether you disagreed with the ending or had problems because you ""Felt"" that the choices you made in the previous installments weren't reflected enough, it really doesn't matter. It's no reason to give this game a score below 7, and the fact that this game is rated a 3.9 is really quite pathetic. To even think that this game is only worth a ""3.9"" you would have to be some grumpy old man living in some old folks home or some kid who stays in his room all day, has no friends and doesn't know how to enjoy quality entertainment. The decisions you made in the previous games do reflect in this one, and yes they matter. Characters that die in ME2 wont be around, characters you saved in ME1 do make an appearance and yes your choices DID have reflect in ME3. Name a game that carries the choices you made from game to game on the same level mass effect has? You cant, there is only stand alone games with choices like the witcher 2, but what game from sequel to sequel to sequel does what the ME series has?. The fact people cry because they feel that their choices never meant anything is LAUGHABLE seeing as how they have nothing to compare it to. Give mass effect some credit, it has done a pretty damned good job. The ending to the series is fine, and honestly it really doesn't matter what bioware did people would have cried and crapped their pants. Everybody has a different idea of how it should have ""ended"" Bioware cant possibly meet everybody's expectations. The gameplay was much improved from the previous two, they added in some more RPG elements, still not as robust as ME1 but pretty close with the talent choices, weapon mods and tons of armor and loot to find. Mass effect 3 is a good game that sold well and that the majority of people enjoyed playing, don't listen to the vocal minority of idiots on here who probably pirated the game or never even played it at all and are just jumping on the hate bandwagon to hate the game like it's some ""fad"" to do so or makes them ""cool and different"" ****, sit down and enjoy the game. End of story. and....advice to metacritic......implement a system where people need to enter the serial code of the game they bought in order to actually review it. See how many of these idiots are still around after **** wont find many.",9,2012-05-18,PC,user

BatmanRising,"The word of the day is ""choice."" The Mass Effect franchise has always rested on the idea that the player gets to pick Shepard's path, and in this last installment BioWare seems determined to give the player a small array of options for almost everything. Are conversations not your thing? There's an option to make them into cut-scenes. Is reflex-action combat too challenging? There's an option to make it significantly simpler (you only need to bother taking cover in the hardest of fights). Like your helmet? See it in cut-scenes. Hate it?

Lesquid,Improved customization mechanics. Builds on choices from previous two games through (most of) the epic story. Great replay value and adds enjoyable multi-player. Vast tracts of great cutscenes and dialog (although not for many trivial side quests) make for a dramatic and touching conclusion to the ME series.

woahyeah,"Absolutely epic, one of the best games I've ever played. Besides the ending that has a lot of people upset, this game is absolutely gorgeous, the choices and story are enthralling, well-written, and emotional. Truly in the tradition of past Mass Effect games while taking the series to a new level. Absolutely love it, definitely one of my top 5 favorite games I've ever played. The multiplayer is fun as well. I would love to talk face to face with someone who doesn't like this game, because I feel like there is a real bandwagon sentiment for people giving it bad reviews. There is the whole indignation of the DLC releases, which has some valid points, but that doesn't make this game a bad game. Just taken objectively on its merits, it is an amazing and epic experience if you like RPG's, and like getting into a story. Any movie/game can be unenjoyable if you are in a mood to make it that way, or don't like getting absorbed in a story. For instance, the original Mass Effect and Bioshock 1 were favorites of mine, but one of my best friends doesn't really get into story lines so he just played for the action and preferred other games. But for someone who likes an engrossing atmosphere and story line, this is the game for you.",10,2012-05-16,PC,user

Cytheria,"Let's ignore the ending here, because I guess anyone reading this review now either already knows about it, or doesnt want to. Truth be told, its a good game. Playing it I felt the tech had been improved enough to fix immersion in some areas without completely overhauling a system we had been used to since ME 1. That said, the story line was a little lack lustre and I didnt feel it was quite as gripping as the franchises earlier installments. Dont get me wrong, there are a few moments that are truely and magnificently choreographed and will reduce most gamers to tears, but they are few and far between. Mostly however, I found that once again I felt like all my previous efforts had been ignored and for the 3rd time I had manic rush to collect my companions... again.... make them like me... again... and then actually get on with dealing with what was left of the main campaign. The multiplayer experience, for me has been where the game has demonstrated its real staying power. Taking a couple of key areas from the game (and with some later DLC a few new custom ones too) you and a group of up to 3 friends are pitted against AI opponents in a king of the hill style beat down, with assorted minimissions to keep things interesting. Even after clearing my 100% readiness for the end game of the single player campaign, I've found myself coming back to multiplayer because it is nice, casual friendly, fun. Mass Effect 3 is certainly worth a look if you have the money and time available to try it. Players opinions are very divided on the endgame thing.... personally I like where they went with the endgame, I just didnt like how it was presented to the player.. Your opinion will undoubtedly vary.. I'm not commander shepard, but this has definitely been my favorite multiplayer game on my pc for the past few weeks.",7,2012-05-16,PC,user

Arrogantius,"Most of the people who've played ME3 hate it because it failed to live up to THEIR expectations. Was the game as horrendous as most users say? Not at all. It was rushed, it's buggy, the endings are stupidly presented - not stupid, just done poorly - but the Mass Effect series - ME3 included, showed a great many just what the gamer medium can do, rather than just mindless and endless reiterations of the COD style of brainless gunplay. Imagine an epic movie you can actually play, can actually influence - that's Mass Effect as a series. See, people wanted ME3 badly. Really badly. So badly that they got what they wanted - ME released long before it should have been and now what could have been great has suffered for a lot of impatience, both on behalf of the fans and the creators. Too many fingers in the cookie jar. Not enough quality control - and I suspect - and ego or two in the way in Bioware's offices. The real trouble with a lot of games and movies is that the makers think the average consumer is pretty much a moron, and unfortunately, given the state of what's most popular nowadays, they're not far wrong. That's their business model: fans are stupid. So you get half-done and half-thought through and just too much wrong with it. Was the game ""bad""? Nope. It was actually pretty good. Was it Mass Effect? That's trickier. We were promised many things with ME3, 99.9999999% of which we did not get. They *can* fix it.

Neu-ro-man-cer,"Game of my Life!!! I just finished it. NO SPOILERS, don't worry :) I invested around 50+ hours in the game, done every side-quest, had nearly all the dialogs = I tried to extract as much as possible from the game. I was playing an imported character from ME2, which was imported from ME1. People, listen!!! There is no problem with the story or the ending!! It is consistent, it is even logical, and it has a huge moral and emotional impact (as does the story). My decisions from ME1 and ME2 were reflected in ME3. I wouldn't say that they completely changed the flow of the game, but they Had An Effect. A Mass Effect:)) The game is brilliant!! It is better and bigger in every sense than ME1 or ME2. The story is larger, the game is more focused on essence, better graphics, good acting / voice acting, LOTS OF CHOICES and ways to play, and even the combat system and the multiplayer is enjoyable. About the ending (WITHOUT SPOILERS): you need to have a LOT of War Assets, and a correct Galactic Readiness level. Thats it. ...for the latter you need a legal copy of the game to be able to play online multiplayer, to increase the Galactic Readiness level from 50% to 100%. BUT: I could finish the game with a logical, and effectively POSITIVE ENDING with only 53% Galactic Readiness. ...but for that I needed to collect almost all War Assets throughout the game. ...so if you find less, then increase you Galactic Readiness, and then the end of the game won't be a guaranteed defeat, then you may have a POSITIVE ENDING!!! ...but you need to invest energy into it. This game has TONS to offer. The story is wonderful in my opinion. There are great thoughts scattered all around the plot. ...without spoilers it would be hard to mention any, so I need to stay silent about that now, but, hell it was a FANTASTIC GAME, and I am soooo sorry, that it was over yesterday night. ...it was long, very long (especially doing every possible side-quest, talking to everyone, etc.), but I could play it for even longer. So, considering this, the sheer size of the game, all the content, all the value (which is also Artistic value = Art), I would say that it was absolutely easy for me to forget about the small glitches here-and-there. See: the game was stable like a rock. BUT: here-and-there there were small animation glitches, and even minimal (far from game-breaking) quest-glitches, one or two at most from the latter. At the beginning the game is like a tutorial. A bit linear. For newcomers. OK. ...but then, be patient, and it will expand!! 3rd, 4th, 5th mission, and you'll see!! Just give it time. ...if you put this investment into this game, it will reward you with even more!! ...if you like science fiction, RPG and FPS, and all that. For me this was one of the best games of my life. It is TRULY MAGNIFICENT!!! ...but to be able to get that all, I'd strongly suggest you to play ME1 and ME2 __WITH ALL DLCs__!!! The game is constantly referring to ME1 and ME2 with all the DLCs (until ""The Arrival"" for ME2). But they are also great, so I'd suggest you to play it all BEFORE starting ME3. THEN all your investment will be rewarded. Money, time and energy - I promise. For me it did it. I wish if only BioWare (or any other company) would take the time and energy and ambition to make such GRAND GAMES in the future!!! Mass Effect 3 is SIMPLY EPIC. Nothing more to say. Shepard out. :)))))) P.S.: About myself shortly: I am 34 years old, playing computer games for the last 30 years, even now, as a university teacher (I teach informatics and AI at my University).",10,2012-05-09,PC,user
Rosco,"First of all, I would say that Mass Effect 2 isn't just the greatest RPG ever to grace the console but it's arguably the greatest game ever made. It delivered such a compelling, deep, rich, atmospheric experience that continues to live long in the memory. So my expectations where probabaly over ambitious for the third outing. And after playing the game over and over again, devoted hours of life I can understand the disapproval the game has gathered but would definetly say that Mass Effect 3 is by no means a game worthy of a '0.' Picking up from where the ME2 DLC Arrival left off, ME3 see's Shepard relieved of his duties as the consequences of his actions during the DLC, whilst on Earth the Reapers have launched an overwhelming onslaught leading Admiral Anderson to set Shepard the mission of uniting the galaxy's forces. Ofcourse the gameplay unfolds from here and you are able to import your saved data meaning that anyone who didn't make it from ME1&2 won't be in ME3. However, an early discovery is made after saving Liara, where she reveals that there is a potential weapon capable of destroying the Reapers; The Crucible. From here that's what it's all about. Travelling across the galaxy uniting forces whilst making major decisions along the way regarding the future of the Krogan race, the Geth and Quarians, aswell as taking care of personal loose ends including romantic options where you can decide who Shepard finally ends up with. Cerberus are also heavily involved under the guidance of The Illusive Man (TIM) who believes the Reapers should be controlled and not destroyed and throughout you have to deal with their attempts to take the Citadel as well as mounting an attack on their headquarters as a starting point towards the final battle. Your decisions along the way as you will already know are important in determining the ending to the game however even more vital is Effective Military Strength (EMS) which has a huge impact in final outcome of your Shepard's journey, this is mainly gained through online play. Regardless of who you sacrifice or save it all leads down to Citadel where a battered and blooded Shepard faces a final showdown with TIM,ultimately resulting in an old friends death, before all is finally revealed and the fate of the galaxy sealed. Lets just say you are in for rude awakening if you thought every decision you had to make was going to be crucial in determining how Mass Effect 3 ends. As you are transported to the pinnacle of the Citadel, the Catalyst approaches you in the shape of the young boy who dies at the start of the game who explains everything. Unfortunately the explanation isn't anything i could have possibly imagined but nonetheless he reveals that the Reaper cycle is an attempt to prevent organic life from wiping itself out by creating synthetic life leading you to face three options; 'Destroy,' 'Control,' or 'Convert.' All three result in the apparent death of Shepard however if you choose 'Destroy' and have the correct amount of EMS you can gain the 'perfect' ending where it shows a potentially alive Shepard breathing amongst the ruins of the destruction which results in the mass relays being destroyed and the Normandy ending up stranded on another planet... then after the credits have rolled an old man is shown with a young boy, who asks the elderly gent to tell him more stories about 'the Shepard' implying that Shepard's legend lives on. We all know the controversy regarding the ending and initially I felt as though I had been well and truly conned as all the assurances BioWare has given simply weren't on show. But after taking my time going through things again I'm not as bummed as I first was. The gameplay is awesome. It was always going to be the introduction of new weapons is cool and the shooting system worked superbly well in ME2 so only a few minor tweaks were needed in that department so I didn't have any complains there. The Normandy was fine although you don't get enough of it. Graphically it's not exactly a blockbuster movie. There are annoying glitches along the way but they don't prevent you from playing on, they just frustrate you at times. The plot. Well not so much the story as the ending(s). Let's face it BioWare sold us all short big time! Shepard dying doesn't bother me as much as others, sure it would've been great for him to get that happily ever after but it's the fact they have disregarded everything a player has gone through and delivered such a pointless and worthless ending that a trilogy such as Mass Effect doesn't deserve. Multiplayer was unnecessary but I was relatively impressed but not addicted to it as other games, but is a vital component for those of us seeking that 'perfect' ending. Simply, ME3 is a tremendous game with a terrible ending and as a result is one of the biggest disappointments to date. I await the extended epilogue in the hope of some REAL closure.",7,2012-05-08,PC,user

Burnsidhe,"Decent game play, carrying forward the tradition of ME 2. Adding options for powers, weapons, a good step in the direction of RPGs. However, only one hub location hurts, as does the feeling of a small universe. It's understandable in terms of the story, and I don't miss endless exploration, but having more places to stop and look around would be nice. The characterization is excellent, except for things like pandering to IGN in the form of Jessica Chobot being included in the game. Characters do react well, and appropriately to their established personalities. Shepard even shows signs of the strain of forming alliances between groups that don't want to work together. The downside is that some Renegade choices are more ""puppy-kicking evil"" than ruthless pragmatism. However, choices ultimately don't matter. Everything boils down to a single number. The ending is horrible, not coherent with the story of the trilogy to this point, and actually invalidates previous game plots entirely. It puts the player into an emotionally numb free fall after some very powerful scenes. The final splash-screen message that ends with ""Purchase future DLC!"" is exceptionally insulting. Rumor has it that Casey Hudson and Mac Walters wrote the endings in isolation, and that the rest of the writing team was not allowed to review and critique it. If this is true, they should be ashamed and apologize for failing to understand basic storytelling. I'm giving it a 6. The game play was good without being frenetic or relying on enemies dancing around like crickets on a hot steel plate for difficulty. The story, up until a certain point at the end, was exceptionally good. But the ending (singular, there's just one that's been palette swapped) is depressing and inconclusive; the story stops but it doesn't *end*.",6,2012-05-07,PC,user

lliam,If you have Mass Effect 1 or 2 you have better games than this one. Average game not worth the money. Since Origin took over DRM spyware all over your P.C so it is up to you if you want this. No customer support at all. The multiplayer has massive issues with people not getting the stuff they paid for and no means of getting any resolution from customer service you just get your account banned saves them needing a customer service department and with a banned account you have no access to the game you paid for. IMO very similar game to 1+2 and not worth more than $5. Hyped beyond belief in Expert reviews. A very linear game save your cash I wish I did.,1,2012-05-06,PC,user

kinraze,"It's BAIT and SWITCH at its lowest, a fun game at its highest. Unfortunately the more invested you are into the story and the universe, the worse off you are for it. If its your first Mass Effect game, you don't read the codex, you don't really care about anything other than how it plays and if its fun, your in for a treat. If you got all the merchandise, books, dlc, and get thoroughly into a game for its world, you may find the ending very off-putting. Its not as bad as MetalGear switching out the main character a quarter of the way, but its 3 quarters of rad-ness followed by an 8th of ferocity, and an 8th of WTF?!!!!!! The gameplay is the same as ME2 but polished, duck-cover shooter but weapons are now far more powerful to the point that you don't require combinations within your team to pass levels (again, power you probably don't have if you haven't xferred experience over from previous games, so more fun if you haven't played before). Spawning mobs comes from dark walled patches like every other game. Side games like hacking consoles, and scouring each planet for resources are gone. Choices don't even offer alternate combat paths like cookie-cutter FPS's do in their single player mode. As a full priced expansion, this would be an 8 in my mind, but as a solid sequel, this game falls far from expanding on its engine and system other than technical mechanics that i'm sure developers and critics are hailing it for. If i were rating a movie where i got to shoot stuff every now and choose which rad decisions the hero made, then the medium itself would warrant a 10. But as a video game this is a 3.

GhostDog24,"The game graffics just the same as the ME2 with a little update. The game easier and faster than the ME or ME2. And not to mention the awful story... just a question for BioWare: Why the f**k did you fired Drew Karpyshyn out (ME and ME2's writer) and changed him to, no name writers such as Mac Walters and Neil Pollner? I can give this game 1 point because, I'm a huge Mass Effect fan and I used to love these games. Either way, if you wanna destroy this game history, play with it, and !no complain! because a lot of people warned you. PS.: Do me a favour EA/BioWare/Legendary Pictures/WB: Do NOT make a movie from this game 'cause I do NOT want a piece o cr*p from it.

Thawn,"I'll make this short as there is probably little I will say that has not already been stated. But the end line of Mass Effect 3 is the question of whether a game can be ruined by the ending. It should be noted first off that this game is an even further step away from Mass Effect 1, while the level up system is more complex then it was in 2 the game is still essentially a combat sim with dialogue for plot. And here in lies the issue, Shepard no longer has fully articulated options based on what you choose, instead you have a pretty much zinger line in between the standard dialogue. While this did occur in 2 on occasion this is the entirety of the game's dialogue in 3. Combat gameplay is vastly improved, with the insanity A.I being highly sophisticated (though mildly spamming with grenades). As such the game itself will give you some challenge if you want it, and while the pacing is kind of jumpy you do get a sense of motivation once you approach the mid point of the game. However the last 5 minutes of the game will ruin the whole thing, I don' t just mean the ending but the game essentially at the last second takes the rules of the series and ignores them. If I had bought this game as a standalone combat game then I would be greatly pleased, but I bought this to finish off the ME trilogy. And I can honestly think of no way that they could have ruined this ending more. It is not the ending you the player made, it doesn't even feel like the ending the design team made. It is just such a change from the tone of the series that you can tell that something is wrong the moment you hit the ending.",4,2012-05-03,PC,user
thenthomwaslike,"i would have given it a 10 if i could bind my key for sprinting, taking cover, exiting cover, rolling, entering dialogue, interacting with objects, climbing up ledges, jumping off of ledges/ ladders and whatever the hell else the spacebar did in this game to separate keys. we have 128 keys, allow us to use them to avoid this ridiculously clumsy control scheme. I would have given it a 9 if their were any graphical options besides the resolution and anti-aliasing. i would have given it an 8 if day one dlc was not inside of the files and COMPLETELY necessary to the story. I would have given it a 7 if online multiplayer was optional to having a good story in the single player ( after finishing ALL of the fetch quests in the entire game i still had only 3200 ""war assets"" and thus was damned into receiving... the WORST ending of any trilogy i've ever seen/read/played. (this now drops the score TWO MORE points because it is a carnal sin in my book to destroy a story with a bad ending.) It's so illogical, anti-lore oriented, and obviously rushed. We are now at a score of 5.

Flamingcanine,"This game completely ignores the cannon of the last few games. One of the most serious grievances is the ending, which ignores stated cannon so as not to render shephard a worse war criminal then any before. To those who did not buy the Arrival DLC for the second game, you are left staring and wondering ""What did shephard do?"" Even then, shephard being reinstated as a spectre is something that would have applied to the situation. From the Day 1 DLC that has conversations that run the entire game to non sequitors and poor writing throughout the plot. The required aspect of multiplayer is frustrating for those who were sold on the idea of ""Not having to play that aspect of the game."" Furthermore: the multiplayer is bland and uninteresting, relying on a single game mode in small arena maps with laggy and buggy gameplay. combined with the touch and go of searching for a lobby resulting in failing to find a game three out of ten times, makes it more a display in frustration then fun.

agotmanov,"I have but one issue with this game - the writing. I mean really, how hard can it be? ME2 was no freaking masterpiece, but the story was compelling enough to make action meaningful, and occasional stupidities were just something to laugh about and forget. In short, it was fun. I think in general RPG fans (including me) have relatively low standards when it comes to writing, and it's ok. It should be just solid enough so that it doesn't spoil the game. Somehow (miraculously) ME3 fails to deliver. Writing-wise it's a non-stop *facepalm*. How hard is it to come up with a response that wouldn't sound dumb or out of place? After first 30min I started to suspect that somewhere between the end of ME2 and the beginning of ME3 commander Sheppard got a lobotomy. Or maybe he is a husk? Or secretly mind-controlled by Cerberus and they *make him* say all these things? That would be a cool plot. I'd play that game. Apparently, ME3 is a different one, and it stinks.

NorBdelta,"To start off I have -1 point due to the lack of narrative coherence at the end (a few changes would be welcome to help erase the lack of closure and finality with descent reasoning). OK now I have been holding back for quite a while to write an informed review about Mass Effect 3 in its entirety. I have finished every mission, every side quest and all of the romance options (including male Shepard and Cortez) apart from one as I did not want to play all three games again for Kaidan. Now I was extremely saddened by the ending but not a disappointed sadness, a sadness that stems from watching my character grow from the beginning till the end, the music accompanied by all of his actions and his selflessness truly struck a soft-spot in my blood soaked, bullet ridden game favoring heart. I did not for one moment desire the ending to be different, the ending provided a truly satisfying if not a little sad close to a game that has spanned several years and three games. The combat worked, there are fewer team-usable characters than the previous games but this is not a hindrance, many of the previous qualms in the galaxy can be resolved or deepened by your characters actions, many forms of galactic closure can be achieved via the right actions all of which I found perfect (Geth, Quarians, Krogen, etc). Many people are dissatisfied by the endings but I suspect they have not dedicated themselves to the game and played enough to warrant suitable endings. Now the multi-player does affect the single player campaign and ending to a degree. The multi-player adds to the Galactic Readiness Rating which affect single player Readiness that affect the campaign. It is not necessary to play but means that playing it mean less single player items need to be fulfilled to get certain endings. Again I found it very enjoyable to play the multi-player in between campaign missions. The unlocks are very appropriate, not to unbalanced, and has room for many combat styles and strategies. I have certainly had closure, it is a shame others have slammed it to the point of worthlessness. As Bioware are adding a extended ending I am curious as to what it is and hope it does not add purely to satisfy a few closed minded individuals. As with the previous two games I highly recommend playing the First Second and this game.",10,2012-04-29,PC,user

Guess what every choice you made in mass effect #1 #2 and #3 don't matter. You get the same ending as everyone else. With no closure. Let it be perfectly clear, your choices mean absolutely nothing. If someone died in a previous game, someone who is basically that person only a stunt double shows up and says basically the same thing and does the same thing. Does having geth as allies matter over krogen? No it doesnt. You dont ever fight beside your allies, the they only show up in a single cutscene. How many endings are there? Just 1 regardless of what people tell you, all 3 endings are 99% the same, as regardless of the choices you make, the exact same things happen. The game plays just like all other bioware games, where they are a series of short stories tied to a larger story, but the short stories have no effect on any other the other stories in the book, or the larger story of the book. Do i recommend the game. For a budget purchase, yeah, you will get some fun out of it. If you can put aside the weak story and terrible ending. The game lacks that something that shows up when a developer really cares about their product. Take the witcher 2 for example. The witcher 2 is a better game in every area when compared to ME3.

alexnode,"The game was very interesting, and had a lot of unique ideas. It was a bit dumped down in comparison with the first one but overall it was an epic experience. There is always a misunderstanding between streamlined and simplistic! Pro: Intergalactic science fiction rpg with worlds to explore, characters to meet, intrigue, sex and frantic action. Yeaaay ... Con: Rushed ending, DLC from day one, ripping off people ... The ending was rushed for the release and it left a bitter after taste. In a way you built suspense for 3 episodes to end up with a bit of undersigned ending. Unfortunately we have seen things like that before ... still the overall experience was really nice. Somehow I feel that people wanted more. To be honest Mass Effect, one of the best games ever ,is behind in terms of dialogue and plot from a good film or book. As games in general still are. Regarding changing the ending to suit the needs and ideas of the players I believe is completely unacceptable, the designers of Mass Effect decided on three endings ( unpolished endings) that were interesting but unfinished. I completely agree if they want to polish it but not to change it. Sometimes you like the ending sometimes you don't like them. But artistic democracy or design by committee, is usually dull and sterilized. If I like something is to go the other way around... to complete let them actually design the ending properly as they originally imagined ... let the accountants screaming about the target audience and demographic and do the right thing ! I have the impression that EA as usual is behind rushed endings and despicable DLC ... I give the game 8 instead of 10 because of the DLC and the rushed ending. By the way in the age of intergalactic travel I am quite sure guns will not need ammo. I know that legions of players play all those U.S army games and they troll around about the combat system but things don't always have to be the same with these boring shooters.

The final choices are not only nonsensical (actually contradicting several points already established in the game) but you only get the option of up to three basically identical endings regardless of your efforts.

Frosty1627,"First game was great. Second was even better. So you can assume that third will be the best in the series and again Game of The Year ???. Not in this case. To begin with do you remember how many side quests there were in first game and each of them were interesting in their own way. Second game was little bit different, it tried to be action game with RPG elements so quests weren't that awesome as in first game but still were good. Well in third game there are two types of quests: N7 ""missions"" and Citadel ""missions"". First one nothing as N7 missions in previous games. All maps that feature in this ""missions"" are from multiplayer and tasks are ""find and bring something back"" or ""kill everything"". For quests were you need to find something and bring it back you would want a journal so you would know were to go. The ""Journal"" in ME3 has only description of quest, nothing about were we can find item or were bring it. New Citadel also ****. It just ****. Now I would like to skip part about interaction with NPCs and Normandy cause it will take a lots of time. The major problem with game is endings. Remember when developers said that non of the endings will be the same ??? Remember when they said that multiplayer won't be connected to single player ??? Remember when this **** said that all choices we made in previous games will huge influence on ending ??? Either I play it wrong either developers are really bad liars. To get different endings we need war assets. To get them we need to play multiplayer a lot and a little bit of single player. Then we need to choose between 3 different lights. Light which we choose will be color of explosion. There is some difference like Reapers will destroy Earth or Shepard can survive but you got the point. So what EA did looks like Call of Duty when it was just a baby. With each game it gets worser and worser until they will find another company... Awful quests, ugly locations, f****d up ending, day one DLC and unnecessary interactions make this game worst game of this year. Yes, worser than Amy...",1,2012-04-23,PC,user
Plucx,"I never was a Huge fan, but I played the two first and had fun. However ME3 is BARELY a ME game! 1) First is Disregards for announced gameplay: a)Promised closure : -No closure depending on what you did in 3 games. No difference. -Cheap loophole, stuff made before is IRRELEVANT - PERIOD -Old crew is not to be part of new crew so, if they died or not have NO impact beyond some score (20pts on 5000 total, yeah it's that cheap, Miranda is now some points ... ) -Xenophage or not, end stat, no more -Saved council in first one or not ... who cares? Same with Anderson In Council, nope whatever you chose in any games i'ts Udina. Yep, in a way they tell us to shut up and swallow! 2) Poor quality ending that disregard the working of it's own story mecanics. -Deux-Ex writing mecancis ... writer did an asspull in the end. CHEAP ONE TOO! -Reaper having circular logics, really they seems to be there because of a simple logic loophole ... but it's even worse than that in term of writng skill! -Illogical and inconsistent ... so much stuf going wrong here! 3) Unacceptable answer from BOTH company. They ignored that we spent OUR money on stuf we THEY promised in their product but did not. 4) Low quality pre-ordor edition that is NOT worth it! -Bad weapon mecanics. Special weapons are all broken. Who need a shotgun with medium damage and pinpoint precision! It got no range too ... jeez. All basic weapons are beter than the 'special' sones. -They cna't even be there for the show! You can only see them in single player! 5) Day one DLC! Enough said 6) Trough the whole ME3 experience, you feel like a cash cow. and up to the end game. Deep rooted impression that the publisher or makers are pushing too hard on their client wallet. -Day one DLC -Cheap end game pop up (yeah, they do a 3 line epilogue saying ""Game over, shepard is hero and wait for more in DLC). -Pre-Order Art book is in fact a DEMO of the ""real one"". They also advertise it along the way (Do you really think that afther 80$ spend on DIGITAL i'm going to break another leg and buy a 80$ book from these guys?) -Their PR keep to the players not as customers but as ""emotional fans"". Oh, I'm getting emotionnal alright and I'm sure NOT a fan. I'm a human being and i'm spending my FXXXXXXX money on falsely advertised prodcuts! -These guys have NO respect for their clients. I wonder what we are in fact, I cows are at least well cared for so they can be milked for years. Yeah, it's THAT bad ... 7) EA and Bioware Refused to appologise that is/feels sincere. If you read between the lines it says : Shut up whiny kids. Hey i'm over 30 with two kids and i'm not that rich. If I spend 80$ on a product that is badly advertised I'm expecting at least a little respect from those who sold **** to me and called it gold! 8) The interconnection inbetween game journalism and publisher is not to be dismissed. We all know it, we don't beleive the big review guys anymore. Especially thioses who gave a 10/10. And chowbot, com'on! A journalist should not be part of the story she's reviewing! Imagine if Lucas tell you phantom menace is great, will you beleive him? 9) One of these mistake in itself would not be too bad. Actually there is a ton of games that have similar or bigger issues. However, it's when you put it ALL together that you get a pile of **** soooo smelly and soo disgusting that you don't want to go trough the ME3 experience. Play 1st and 2nd but don't ever play the THURD one! Do they think we are morons? Do they care calling 90% of their client idiots? WE, the hard working players, we don't seem to matter for these guys, In fact, we are less important than the lowest of corporate scumbag at EA. Why should I care anyway, i'm not here to help these company, i'm here to tell you guys: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! IT'S NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY! And if you love ME, Please please , don't finish the game in ANY way. Get your character killed and call-it a day. Avoid the rage. Marauder-shield forever.

theGrey,"I honestly don't know what the problem is with all these negative reviews. I've played ME1, ME2 and ME3 back-to-back (on PC) and let me tell you, ME3 is my favourite alongside ME2. The controls are smooth, the dialogue has all the depth I've come to love and all of my choices from previous MEs carried through 100%. I think the visuals and audio are truly epic and what I came to expect from a 2012 game. A big thumbs up from me. These user scores of 1 and 0 etc are obviously false or fabricated. It's unthinkable that someone could give this game such a low score.",10,2012-04-23,PC,user
LieuRob,"As a game, Mass Effect 3 was both a disappointment and a decent game. Straight off the bat, none of the decisions made in the previous titles matter any more. Someone died? They dont show up. They lived? You get 10 minutes of facetime. Or they die. Bioware realised that the amount of binary decisions given to the player made such a complex game that they could not create it, and cut most of them out. The main decisions of the previous games matter little. You get a line of dialogue, it dosent matter what you chose, the outcome will always be the same. 1/10 GRAPHICS Graphically the game is worse. Lots of low-resolution textures because of the move to consoles. Thats ok, we can live with that, as its most likely that they will have post-release texture packs, etc. Noticeable, load times are much better; the game runs smoother, polished, and mostly bug free. Overall, it shelved up as a acceptable package, but nothing innovative here. Animations were a bit jarred as well, but its not game breaking - yet. 8/10 CONTENT Mass Effect 3 has the same content as Mass effect 2. Its good, kept me going for a good 20 hours with a bunch of side stuff. Day 1 DLC is a crime; paying 80 dollars isnt enough to give you all the content they made, they want you to give them 20 more. THAT is terrible. Either way, it doesnt dissapoint in that sense. Voice actors and environments are good; no reuse of areas, exotic worlds and planets - its all good in this sense. 8/10 STORY The story started off solid. The lack of previous characters was unsettling, and downright annoying. You spend hours upon hours scouring the galaxy for them, and you barely see them again, or they die. The writers wrest them away from you, killing them off for superficial drama. Its hard to watch. It also felt dumbed down, as if they were trying to simplify it to the point were all the political dealings are gone, and you just shoot things. 3/10 THE ENDING Most dissapointing ending EVER CREATED. I spent weeks under a rock so I could play it spoiler free (I already had the game, but went away for a while), and it just hurt when I played it. !!! SPOILERS !!!; The ending is terrible; I always play paragon, I actually cant do anything else, its just the way I play. I thought I did everything right, did the hero's job, but EVERYONE DIED FOR ME IN THE END. Damn, it was the most heart breaking thing, purely because in a game you should have SOME power to choose your ending in an RPG, not have the developer just decide that for you. I went out of my way to get paragon points, but found those options greyed out at every turn, even at the maximum. You dont get any control over the direction and end of the story. I didnt use any walkthrough but you shouldnt have to read Biowares mind to get a decent ending. Its not worth playing again. 0/10 Bioware has promised to make a extension to the end of the game, but youll probably have to pay for it. Because its corporates focus has ruined their games (see Dragon Age 2), its just a waste of money. VERDICT Skip this entry, just watch the endings on youtube for ""closure"". But, if you didnt play any of the previous games/ dont care for the story/rpg elements, its not bad, an average entry into the series.",3,2012-04-23,PC,user

tekshow,"Thanks Bioware for a fantastic epic. This game is slightly impaired by lofty expectations and warm fuzzy feelings provided by the first two games. As the trilogy moved on it had become more and more streamlined from a gameplay perspective. RPG elements have been whittled down to a small skill tree that quickly maxes out in nearly every area. Is this a problem? Not really, unless you want to play the same games over again. I feel like Mass Effect 2 was the culmination for the series in terms of gameplay, space travel, rpg elements, and fleshed out mechanics that drove the experience like bypassing doors and farming planet minerals mini games. The latter of which might not seem like a big deal but when it's absent it's very noticeable. What mass effect 3 has going for it is a breakneck pace of reaper fighting badassery. It all happens so fast you won't even notice clipping through a 25-30 hour game. Deep relationships are found, love lost, and many companions bear great sacrifice. It's some f the finest story telling in the medium. The ending needs a little work, but the core game is breathless from start to final assault. Want more, the combat is finely fine tuned and it's Sci-Fi gears of war approach is very fitting. As a person who doesn't regularly play shooters and enjoys RPGs more, ME3 delivers a tremendous variety in play style over its predecessors. Not the least of which is thrilling drop in multiplayer that actually effects the man game! Co-op multiple player makes a four man group of strangers band together to fight common enemies. It's a kick seeing all the species and character types in action with all their respective tactics. It's a great game, a cap off to the series,they only real negative is that like most trilogies the second title remains the best In the bunch.",8,2012-04-19,PC,user
hildegain,"If I were you I would buy Mass Effect 1 and 2 and play those first BUT I DO suggest you buy Mass Effect 3 and play it to at least see why it's so bad. The voice acting is great! The characters are good! The graphics are decent. The customization is good. Dialogue options, paragon and renegade are fantastic. BUT Bioware got lazy with the reapers. The plot is a COP-OUT. The ending betrays everything about the mass effect series. The writing is filled with holes. The game has been largely falsely advertised, you do not get anything that Bioware have promised in the past. This game resolves NOTHING. This game either ends with ""a wizard did it"" or ""it was all a dream"" depending on how you interpret it... This game takes everything ME1 and ME2 built up and says ""that doesn't really matter now"". You do not need to have played the other games to play this one, you don't. None of your choices, none of your decisions will account for ANYTHING. This game can be stand-alone but I suggest getting the far superior Mass Effect 2. There is a reason why ME2 is the people's favourite, it is coherent and the ending pays off. You get fewer squad mates in this game because apparently Bioware feel that you couldn't connect with the squad of Mass Effect 2 too well but everyone will tell you how much they love the squad you have in Mass Effect 2. Essentially this game was delivered to us with several promises that it fails to keep and not only that but it will personally insult you. Removal of everything wrong with this game will take several writers peer-reviewing each other's work to pull it off, no surprise then that many of the bad ideas in this game were NOT peer-reviewed in writing AT ALL. There are so many good ideas that they could have taken from ME1, ME2 and the novels. Remember the dark energy problem? That's gone now. Remember the reasons why Reapers harvest life? Gone too. Remember why you need to destroy the Reapers? Oh you know what? Just get it, I don't care how you get it just play it through and compare how it works compared with everything that came before. There will be times in this game that you fall in love with the story only to have your heart broken again and again every time the plot goes somewhere silly. I still have yet to even mention the ending really, I'll leave that as a surprise, I don't want to post spoilers...",1,2012-04-19,PC,user

HeartlessFinale,"** This is my own opinion on the game, It should be noted that these reviews aren't exactly completely trustworthy because of this. Mass Effect 3 isn't a perfect game, the whole first day DLC fiasco and disappointing endings are some of the major let downs of the game. Despite this Mass Effect 3 succeeds in delivering good game-play blending in RPG elements (leveling up, picking specific bonuses to powers/characters) with a shooter creating something that is a decent hybrid. The ems system is somewhat effective and actions that were previously taken can impact your general story as certain scenes and missions are only available if certain choices were previously taken. Exploration with the Normandy SR2 is available in a simple system. The story itself is decent. The main things pulling it down is that fact that our decisions don't have a direct impact to the ending (this was promised). With the plot holes and lack of explanations in the ending it just feels better to play the game up to the ending and then stop. If the endings do get fixed though, this is a game that should be tried in my opinion (of course after the other two games of the trilogy ).",8,2012-04-19,PC,user

Its a **** literally is just a big list that never updates itself so you can find yourself questioning where you got to on the side missions. 2. The major issue with the game was the ending. The story was well constructed and I was impressed with all the chapters up to but not including the ending. The space casper/deus ex mechanic was an odd choice and while it wasnt the 16 endings Bioware promised I would of accepted it had it not been for the gaping plot holes that riddled the ending, which in turn just made the ending look and feel sloppy. For someone who is really impressed with the universe/franchise they created it really killed my desire to play it again which is in stark contrast to the amount of times I replayed ME1 and ME 2. I wish Bioware all the best for the future but Dragon Age 2 and Mass Effect 3 has taught me to be more cautious about accepting what Bioware promises in the future.",6,2012-04-19,PC,user

The first 95% of the game was fantastic, very engaging and fun, I did have issues however with how the player characters voice acting was handled the amount of auto dialogue really took away any feeling that Shepard was actually my character rather than Biowares. Multiplayer is actually surprisingly fun although does have a tenancy to get repetitive. The last 10% of the game about from Priority: Cerberus onwards was a really big let down for me, they didn't do a good job for the finale of the series and this is especially disappointing given how good other sections of the game where.

SHO1BANG,"Let's be clear. The game was really fun. At least for me. I loved the comabt, and for thee first time it didn't bore me (like it often did in ME 1 and ME 2). And the story wasn't too bad either, and trying to unite everyone was interesting and Cerberus was also an intriguing part of the story. -1 for even less dialogue choices ( they already started with this in ME 2). Often it didn't feel like an interactive RPG. But I can forgive that, it didn't bother me that much, as there were some great interactions with the characters in this game. And -1 for the ending. It's just stupid that you HAVE to do one of these 2 (or 3?) things, none of which leaves me satisfied. It's not TERRIBLE as many people say, but it's still NOT GOOD.

Bheg,"First, I want to warn you who didn't play this game, that it is not a good movement to trust the user reviews (and I will include myself in this). This is because this game is so controversial, that have made a lot of people enrage about it. This people, which didn't like the ending of the game, and therefore the ending of the franchise, are so frustrated that will easily give this title a 0/10 just because of its ending, which represents just the last minute of gameplay. In my opinion, this is very unfair, and can lead people to believe this game is actually bad, when it isn't. In fact, this game is probably one of the bests RPG you will have this year. Graphics: 9/10. With better graphics than its predecessors, ME3 meets perfectly what its expected for a science-fiction title of this generation. Sound: 9/10. This game will probably make you care about the music. Some of the songs really fit the critical moments, making them even more epic and memorable. Of course and as expected, Bioware also made a brilliant work dubbing the game. Gameplay: 10/10. If you though ME was a brilliant mixture of RPG and shooter playstyle, then you will simply love ME3, being even more dynamic and intuitive than its predecesors. The cover system will make u enrage sometimes, but you will be having so much fun that you will easily forget about this. As a negative, ME3 has more ""autodialog"" than previous bioware titles, which makes you get less involved in conversations, but don't worry, you will still be able to make pretty big choices through the game. Oh and good news for naughty players, ME3 allows same-sex romances, yum! Also, there's a quite addictive multiplayer mode. Story: 8/10. ME3 feels more linear than its predecessors, and it is. It also has less secondary missions and the main quest is probably shorter. Story is still immersive and the narrative is great, becoming quite emotional in some moments and portraying very good a stressed Sheppard, which will show the signs of pressure through the game and have a pretty hard time making some important decisions. It is satisfying to see what the characters of the previous games have become and most of them will return and make u feel the strong friendship they have with the protagonist. As a negative, ME3 story, while still good, fails to exceed that of ME2. The final stage could also have been larger and you will get a very unexpected ending that u may not like at all (I did like it, anyway). If you have played the previous games, then for sure you have to play this one and expect to have your own strong opinion about the end of the saga. If, on the contrary, you haven't playing the previous games, then... What are u doing here? Go to your nearest store and buy this three must-have!",10,2012-04-18,PC,user
Flash_Over,"Unlike some people who wrote hastily reviews, I on the other hand played the game VERY thoroughly and I have mixed feelings. I will first start with the Pros: Better graphics! Everyone loves better graphics and the improvements are very satisfying specially how the lights falls onto objects almost perfectly. Improved character builder! In the first and second Mass Effect games I was very sick of limited options and the poor quality of the faces especially on the female shepherd that made your character unpleasant to look at. Now in Mass Effect 3, if done correctly you can actually make characters that look tolerable. Weapons! More guns and best of all... these guns are upgradable with attachments and modifications. Plus Mass Effect 3 adds way more guns to the table then before, and guns from every species. Armor sets and more armor types with better color customization! This really brings more authentic RPG feel then before. Also the sounds, talent trees upgrades from leveling have all been improved! Also the plot of the Reapers finally attacking is really gripping and interesting. However the good things in this game end there. Cons: Poor dialog and the LACK of more dialog options compared to ME1&ME2. This kills that classic ME experience and makes you feel your watching a interactive movie.. then actually playing the game. You cant even ask or discuss things with you squad mates like before and when you can.. its limited. Relationships are a bust and pointless, and lack any sort of interest as its more of just one night stands then actually a relationship and feeling for that character. Multiplayer... I never found or figured out why this exists besides egging you on to buy more DLC for unlocks. Besides... the multiplayer is not good compared to other DEDICATED shooters. Day one DLC... that in in itself in self explanatory. This told me that Bioware wanted to milk more money from an already overpriced game. DLCs should be later additions.. not content Stripped from the original version in hopes of charging extra money. Limited sqaud mates. Compared to the first to MEs the lack of squad mates is astounding... even squad mates from an imported character and nothing more, but side story then anything else since none of them want to join you on your missions with the exception of Garrus(Which is was relieving). Poor animations of team members, they have no other movement animation, but one and if they need to run faster... they look like chickens with their legs moving so fast its funny. WAR ASSETS, these are pointless useless and DO NOT effect the final mission ONE BIT. As long as you have the minimal strength to launch the final mission and do all the story missions you will have the SAME ending as if you had ALL the war assets. The bad dreams about shephard over this little boy was... annoying, after all shepard and done and how much death he/she has experienced... this child is what bothers him/her? In order to make this more fitting I made a female shephard since women tend to feel more towards children. Now.. the notorious ending. I had mixed feelings about the ending, however the ending left more questions then conclusion. One thing was certain that the death of shephard and the the old mad at the end story telling to his the child that this has already happened. This tells me ME3 is the END of the series by killing off shephard and telling that this was all in the past. Ending choices... I felt the ending choices were backwards and each decision had a bad outcome, though the least devastating was the 'green' choice to merge synthetic with organic life. Over all I love the new additions this game and improvements this game gave me, though the story and the ending of the ME series was slap in the face to me. I give this game a 5, despite these short coming the game was undeniably still fun to play.",6,2012-04-17,PC,user

TheBank,"Graphics: 8.5/10 There's nothing that new to see here. The graphics are top notch, but the engine is the same that made the rest of the series. Gameplay: 8/10 If you enjoyed the other mass effect titles then this won't disappoint. The scan for minerals system is gone, which in my opinion is nice. Story: 7/10 Mass Effect 3 tries to take on completing a very diverse story, and does a pretty good job of it. Sound: 8/10 Many of the same interludes from the previous games are recycled throughout (galaxy map, etc). The main score is very good though. Overall: 7/10 Mass Effect 3 straight out of the box (not the collectors edition) is purposefully incomplete with the hope of making money off DLC. Day zero DLC, along with certain areas in the game that seem lacking will make you appreciate how complete other games by bioware are. This game is worth buying in my opinion, but it might be a better idea to hold out until the all inclusive edition comes out. This games got a lot of minor bugs to be worked out as well (no crashes, just little things like missing dialogue and graphic glitches.) All in all a little bit of a disappointment, but it will probably wind up being amazing when it is actually sold in its entirety (instead of its purposefully amputated form).",5,2012-04-16,PC,user

petarded2,"The Mass Effect series started out with Mass Effect 1 as an interactive science fiction epic, reached middle age with Mass Effect 2 as a solid action game with dialogue options, and with Mass Effect 3, develops Alzheimer's disease and becomes Gears of War + occasional purposeless choice. I loved this series; the first game's universe and narrative blew me away, and I had a soft spot for Mass Effect 2, even with it's lack of main plot, developed antagonist, or any real sense of purpose. At least Mass Effect 2 was distinguishable from its predecessor. At least Mass Effect 2 introduced and developed a cast of interesting characters. At least Mass Effect 2 didn't *completely* forget the aspects of exploration from Mass Effect 1. I cannot say this much for Mass Effect 3. The majority of ""player"" dialogue in Mass Effect 3 is automatic, and the dialogue wheel *never* has more than 2 options on it, maybe the occasional ""inquisitive"" option for the rare gamer who wants more than chest-high cover and a big gun. Maybe this would be admissible if the choices had any considerable difference, but typically both options just say the same things in different ways. The Citadel in ME3 is much improved over any city in ME2. This struck me as peculiar until I realized that it was literally the *only place* in the entire game where Shepard isn't constantly shooting things (other than the Normandy, of course). It's the only place with stores. The only place that gives nonessential quests, the last remnant of RPG in this series packed into one location. The nonessential quests are just insulting. I refuse to dignify them with the title ""Side Mission."" They are 3 lines of dialogue: (1) ""Gee, I wish I had item X,"" (2) ""Here you go,"" (3) ""Thanks."" I'm not even exaggerating. Literally 3 lines, every time. You don't even enter into a conversation. One impressive feat is that this game manages to find time for all of the immense Mass Effect 2 cast of characters, but these encounters are brief and generally don't provide much closure for the characters (with the notable exceptions of Thane, Mordin, and Legion). The combat is an improvement over ME2, that is to say, ""it's slightly more like Gears of War."" It feels a bit like clunky and you can roll around to your heart's desire. However, it has somehow found a way to be even *more* segregated from the story. You could replace all the combat situations with black screens saying: AND THEN SHEPARD SHOT THE THINGS, and the story would make complete sense. No decisions are made outside of the designated decision-making areas. This isn't even touching on the cliched story. After countless generic often-forced self-sacrifice scenes, generic space marine characters, and innumerable poor attempts at adding emotion, the game tries to save itself in the last 15 minutes with a forced twist ending. It'd take over 5000 characters to explain just how many different ways this ending is awful. Overall: Lazy game, what little that distinguishes from predecessor is negative, if you liked the previous installments just replay them. Had potential, but extremely poor execution.",4,2012-04-16,PC,user
Doomsdayman,"Summary: A spectacular game. Well worth the money and time. The combat is unique to the RPG genre and the reason this is the only RGP series (to date) I can stand playing long enough to get into the story. The story is just incredible. The main plot is thrilling by itself, but add the ""chose your own adventure book on steroids"", aspect and you have a narrative that was so emotionally gripping it had me on the verge of tears at times. On that note, play from ME 1, it's worth it. Single player: Play/Combat - Excellent: I understand many people do not like the trend of ME away from the traditional RPG standards, but I love it because I venomously HATE several of those standards. Inventories are a cumbersome nuisance that just punish me for not taking time to manage the annoying buggers, and in ME 3 they are happily gone! Learning the intricacies of every single enemy so I know which of my 20 different skills to use is just frustrating (If I want to painstakingly memorize information I'll read a scientific paper on something useful), in ME 3 they simplify this to a reasonable level. On harder difficulties you still have to chose your ammo and prioritize your targets, but you have only a few options to worry about. Granted that can make the game-play a little repetitive. I'm okay with that; part of the reason I enjoyed ME 3 is that it is a first-person shoots, my genre of choice, and any good FPS has to sacrifice a little repetitiveness for well ironed out mechanics and enemies. ME 3 is definitely well ironed out. Which bring us to..... Classes, here I think the 3rd instalment shines. In ME 3 where you put your skill points obviously changes what abilities you have access to and how powerful they are, but quite significantly it entirely changes how effective your play style is. For example I love being a stealthy SOAB, so I play the Infiltrator class. In the last two games, like many others as soon as I chose the class at the start of the game I was stuck as a long range killer with no ability to hold my own in close combat. As it would happen that's how I like to play and so I followed the same path in ME 3, but even as i was doing that I realized that by putting my skills into the other abilities I could make myself a close combat killing machine, appearing in the middle of the enemy, wrecking havoc and beating people to death, only to disappear again. The ability to customize your character to your play-style then is terrific. Story -Out of this World: I can't describe it. play the game twice from ME 1 and you'll get two completely different experiences in ME 3, in almost every mission, every interaction I could sense subtle variations based on my previous actions, that level of impact on the narrative is what sets the ME series a head above the rest. I made decisions that made me proud as thanks to me everyone survived, I made decisions that made me cry as my actions caused my team-mates suicide; NO other game has ever made me feel like my choices have an impact on the story, ever. Which bring us to the one reason this review is not a 10. The last 15 mins. Oh YES I hate the ending, but only because the rest of the game was so incredible. After all that impact you had, you're given ending A, B, or C, and all of your previous decision mean squat to how any of them turn out.(On that note I hope the future DLC will fix the ending situation. After all the hard work the writers must have put into weaving the coherent web of different experiences you can get, I have to believe they would have up and quit Bioware if additions/changes to the ending were not planned from even before release. Here's hoping the ""Indoctrination Theory"" is right) And finally Multi-player -Good: I haven't played that much of this, but what I have I like. It's not as addictive as Halo, or Call of Duty, but its a solidly fun experience. Grab some friends and blow some enemies away, nothing wrong there. The maps are varied enough to add some diversity and the horde-mode style waves are supper fun to mow down in co-op.",9,2012-04-15,PC,user

LewisMweiR,"Great game until you reach the anti-climax deus ex machina lost ending,the mass effect franchise is one of the best of the game industry and is sad that the trilogy end is such a disappointing way",3,2012-04-15,PC,user
nyrdl90,"All those who don't live in caves in North Africa subsisting entirely on raw meat and the supply of family head lice will know the format of this review. Bluntly expressed: the majority of the game was superb if slightly lacking in narrative depth, while the ending was the biggest pile of tripe since mass seppuku on a japanese poultry farm. The fact that this view has been repeated and reaffirmed in every civilised country with a stable entertainment economy and a workable internet connection is convincing proof of its validity. Around the world, captivated fans connected with the games' characters and narrative on an unprecedented emotional level, only to receive an ending so irreconcilable with what precedes it as to leave the series effectively unfinished. So many holes are opened in the overarching plot that what finality remains is unfulfilling and unsatisfying. As a series, Mass Effect is established on a set of fundamental points, all of which have come to be both cherished and expected by the gaming community at large: good writing, player choice, and a compelling continuity and flow of narrative. The promised ""epic conclusion"" of the series consequently shocked and angered players for bluntly denying them these three things; the writing made no sense, what choice players were given had little to no relation to previous events, and the final cinematic left the back-story as devoid of stimulation and open-ended as a limbless corpse. This total reversal of quality is, in many ways, what makes the ending so shockingly and overwhelmingly **** Had the ending been the culmination of ""Back Street Tokyo Hand Job Queen 7"", the audience feedback would not have been nearly as unanimously negative. Despite making no contextual sense in this scenario, and the illiteracy of any prospective audience, the ending's qualitative relativity would have been a lot less stark. However, arguably more frustrating for hordes of belligerent gamers is the absolute lack of official recognition for this obvious shortcoming. Such critical giants as IGN and Gamespot completely ignore the existence of the game's final sequence in many of their respective reviews, instead brushing over the problem with arbitrary and periphrastic adjectives. Worse still, the developers of the game themselves hide behind the age-old excuse of artistic licence, with the catastrophic final sequence being described as integral to ""the team's artistic vision"". Certainly, Bioware's errant artistic **** is evident in their unsubtle use of clichÃd visual metaphors and symbols; children representing innocence, naivety, and spiritual purity are possibly only superseded in terms of frequency in Western literature by the colour-coding of blue for good, red for bad. Gamers went in to Mass Effect 3 expecting an ending to which they could play Flight of the Valkyries or the Dies Irae from Vivaldi's Requiem. Instead, they received an ending barely worthy of Messiaen at his most arrhythmic and atonal. In the end, any reviewer's rating is a tip of the scales: to what subjective extent did the final ten minutes outweigh three games' worth of fantastic content? In my personal view, Bioware has unwittingly pushed its three greatest children off a bridge. We can only pray that they follow Conan-Doyle, pull Mass Effect out of the mud, and give it the bad-ass and well-written funeral it deserves.",5,2012-04-15,PC,user
Rurouni,"The game was a solid 8 for the first third of the game, a 5 as I neared the ending and a 0 at the finale. I was really looking forward to ME3 to build on the fantastic experience of ME2. I even bought the collector's edition in anticipation of a fantastic closure to the series. Sadly the plot holes that emerged, as well as a sense that the ending sequences were rushed out led to probably one of the biggest games related letdown I have experienced in a long while. I can not in good faith recommend this game to anyone. I suggest that the game websites that reviewed this game on launch do a before-after review after they have finished the game. I would be interested to see the final score on metacrtic.",3,2012-04-14,PC,user
Qwertie,"It's hard to know where to begin with this game. First, prerequisites: ideally you'll play ME1 and ME2 first. The default FOV (field of view) is terribly narrow but you can alter the config files to fix it (google ""qscribble fov""). And the game is not designed for stereoscopic 3D vision but fans have hacked it, so it can look great in 3D. I played the game this way on a 10-foot projector screen which makes the whole experience pretty sweet. NOW, it's true what everyone says, the ending is all screwed up (google ""5 reasons the fans are right"" for spoilers). Luckily, since you know it's screwed up, at least you can prepare for the disappointment in advance. But right up until the ending, ME3 is great. It's fun, production values are high, it contains some momentous choices. Best of all, it respects all the major choices and consequences from ME1 and ME2. Wrex (whom you could have killed) plays a solid role, there is a mission for the Rachni (who you could have wiped out), and there are cameos or better for most of your old crew (any of whom might have died in ME2), and the dialogue sometimes mentions things you did in earlier games. You can find faults if you look, like Cerberus suddenly becoming extremely powerful, the decrease in dialogue options compared to ME1 and ME2, etc., but it wasn't a big problem to me. Bottom line: while I hope the low user scores prompt Bioware to alter the ending, ME3 doesn't deserve a low score. The game is still worth buying if you enjoyed ME2. It's less RPG-like and more shooter-like, but whether that's good or bad depends on who you are. And you might want to wait for the improved ending DLC. I would give this game 10/10 if not for the dumb ending, low FOV, the failure to import my ME2 face, and the obnoxious ""Origin"" software (you are not allowed to install ME3 from disk until after you install Origin, sign up for an online account and download updates; and they say that if you buy DLC, you can't start single-player without an internet connection!)",8,2012-04-14,PC,user

ultraviper,"The good: The story kept me not wanting to put the mouse down until I was done. A lot of decisions you made back in the previous 2 games come up in conversations pretty often which is a nice touch. Many cameos from the previous games' characters as well. Graphics are very nice and really well optimized, ran great on my 4 year old PC at 1920x1080 with max settings. The multiplayer is pretty good, better than what I was expecting it to be like. Much more fun than the combat in the single player mode. The bad: Combat got pretty monotonous after the first couple hours. Every fight in the game is the same except for the rare occasions when you get to pilot a mech. The ending was lackluster, yes, but that shouldn't make the game an automatic 0 or 1 score, the ending is just one tiny part of this amazing series.",8,2012-04-13,PC,user
Understated,"I have just completed a complete play-through of the Mass Effect series. This following plays of the individual games numerous times including two play-throughs of ME 3. In the complete play-through I migrated a save to each game utilizing the same developing character and important plot points in order to experience story continuity and empathy so highly lauded and promoted by the maker Bioware. I found too much disparity comparatively to call this a true trilogy in the better sense of trilogies. Most importantly the writing for this never achieves more than just beyond comic book level writing and they at Bioware could certainly use some people on their team that have more understanding of human behavioral dynamics and interaction. Shepards gestures within the framework of very important decisions was painful and embarrassing to watch! The knuckle breaking just before the choice to perform a levering action was childish and insensitive. His sudden shifts of behavior in dialogue choices and actions was heavy/ham handed. There is the invitation to get more involved with characters along the way only to have that short-shrifted terribly in ME 3. At one point I felt as if Bioware wasn't really capable of handling what they had designed in concept, fully realizing it and fleshing it out. It isn't to my mind and could have been so much more. At this particular juncture I have no real interest in further participation in this series. The bottom has fallen out . I have no interest in any future dlc or ending changes. I am a painter/artist and I wouldn't change the colors, patterns, designs to suit someones taste or to coordinate it with someones sofa. The potential patron can see the results up front and choose. I have no backers I am in collaboration with that would influence quality or choices. But Bioware's efforts, admittedly, do include the players, their hard earned money, time, and energy. Their advertisements are replete with participation rhetoric. ME 3's multi-player for example. So there is a different context and responsibility. I will say lastly, that the way the ""Return from Ashes"" dlc was presented was a hurtful thing to do! The very important information given up by Javic in various conversations throughout the game, especially during the Thessea mission with Liara, betrays, to my mind, underhanded marketing behavior on the developers/publishers part. Javic's participation seemed crucial to better understanding and meaning in the storytelling. Yes I got the synthetic(order), organic(chaos) dynamic, which has been around and argued about for some time now, nothing new, which is this series's ending note and the other various models of philosophic thought concerning self-awareness and perception. But in the end it all isn't pulled together very convincingly and the end sort of 'hangs' there by itself. For myself I really thought that the Geth involvement and the partial integration of the Geth faction, the Heretics, was going to be the galaxies 'back door' to the Reaper demise. Something a little more classical and redemptive in grand fashion as the end of ME 2 seemed to be heralding. Awe, that would be too simplistic, but more achievable. This also was my last involvement in anything EA. I know that Biowares top generals are also on the board of EA, and I question the future of fairness and consideration for the consumer at this point. Does the proposal for a changed ending to ME 3 have to do with the players opinion of the story or their pocketbooks and falling out of favor?",6,2012-04-12,PC,user

OneCoolMF,"There are plenty of very thorough and complete reviews out here now, so I'll just try to add some extra value for someone still trying to decide whether to buy this game. Like many other reviewers, I've been playing since ME1, and also as many other reviewers have said, I cared enough to take the time to get on Metacritic and throw in my 2 cents. BOTTOM LINE: I regret buying this game at full retail price. Wait until you can get it cheap, hopefully after they've fixed the bugs and added some worthy DLC. Here's why I feel this way: Much of the game feels rushed, dumbed-down, and simplified, and in the end, I just feel like it didn't work out like it should have. And I really mean it didn't work! Besides issues noted elsewhere, I had my own. I ignored the bad reviews here and got the game a couple of weeks ago. I held my nose and bought the Day 1 DLC. But my extra squadmate never showed up. I looked all over the galaxy. I looked at the online walkthroughs. I did what i was supposed to do (as near as I could tell) and searched where I was supposed to search. But I never hooked up with my would-be Prothean buddy. I got the extra duds for the rest of the squad, but that didn't justify the expense of the DLC. I still feel ripped off about this. There were also vital elements of the game that were just simply never explained. For example, how do you raise your war readiness? The game never tells you that you have to play the multiplayer to do this; I had to read that in another review tonight. Oh well, I've already completed my playthrough, and I won't be going back. HELLO ..... how about including a game manual; even a rudimentary, rinky-dink manual that covers the basic game elements? Also, as other reviewers have stated, dialogue choices seemed narrower and shallower. This specifically affected me in the romance part of the game. I flirted with a couple of characters, and then BAM I'd completed some sort of irreversible step which locked me into romance with a character I didn't even like (Ashley). So when it came time to bend her over in my cabin, I told her I was too busy for her. But the game still had my character telling her he loved her later. Oh well. In ME1 and 2, It was a lot more obvious that you were taking an irreversible step with any of the romance options. As an aside, I'll note that I wasn't very thrilled with my squad choices. More, please. All this time saving the galaxy and I only get 5 squad members? The only real new choice I had was indeed a novel addition and I brought her on lots of missions, but I still felt more choices would have been better. If only the DLC actually worked! On the positive side, they fixed the tedious scanning borefest with something much more workable. And I enjoyed the combat, for the most part. After I leveled up my Vanguard, I had plenty of fun charging into battle. But I got tired of all the melodrama, which seemed forced on my character. I felt like I was in a bad WWII shooter that served as thinly veiled propaganda. The dream sequences with the child were annoying and nonsensical at best, and the forced emotionalism of the child in the game just really seemed out of place. As for the ending ........ yeah it wasn't great. But the real issue I had was that the actual choice you have at the end isn't obvious. Heck, it just looked like two outcomes to me, and not three as I see reviewers here have mentioned. I literally flipped a coin and went up the right platform, not really clear as to what I was doing. When I got close enough to guess which outcome this would result in, I realized this was not the choice I wanted ..... but the game would not let me turn around and go the other direction. Not because of a door or barrier, nay, but just because the game wouldn't let me walk back the way I came once I got past a certain invisible point. Overall, I had some fun playing it and and I enjoyed the missions that tied up lose ends from ME1 and 2 around the galaxy. But in the end, this could not overcome my disappointment in the glaring faults I've discussed, nor the other issues that previous reviewers have noted. I feel bad for Bioware. I've been a fan for a long time and I think they genuinely care. But I can't say this was a good game when it has so many faults that should have been remedied before release. Guess I'll just blame it on EA. I don't really care to go back again even if they add DLC to fix things.",3,2012-04-11,PC,user
tatchely87,"Wow, Bioware turned my favorite RPG series of all time down to a Gears-of-War-type sci-fi shooter. I'll admit, the combat is 100% better. But Bioware has changed the formula from what made us all love the first two Mass Effect games. The conversations with NPCs were the best part of the first two games -- now they aren't much more than cutscenes. In Mass Effect 3, instead of feeling like you are actually conversing with NPCs, you merely watch Shepard talking to them. Its so frustrating to see ""my"" Shepard get turned into a cookie-cutter gaming action hero. You get a couple of options every now and then, which I'm not sure even cause differences in the dialog. Contrast this to the first two games, where Shepard didn't say anything without you telling him what to say, and those conversation choices made it feel like you were actually making a difference. Bioware tries really hard to make every cutscene (of which there are way too many) super epic and emotional. It turns out most are just really corny. Its a lot like Gears of War, which I enjoyed. But I'm not looking for Gears of War here, I'm looking for Mass Effect! It makes me really sad that somehow, Bioware just isn't the studio they used to be. I feel like they are trying to just appease 8 year olds that just want to play to blow things up. I makes me more sad that I can't REALLY continue the amazing experience that was Mass Effect 2. Its their same Dragon Age II mistake, all over again.",2,2012-04-11,PC,user
Boro666,"Mass Effect never was a great game, not even good. It was passable, if you had few hours to kill. But ME3 is basically the worst part. Its short, simple, boring and insanely small. It's a hallway shooter for kids, with difficulty level acceptable even for sea slugs.",1,2012-04-11,PC,user
Vicissitude,"I think a lot of the user reviews here are unfair. Yes, the game has some surprisingly nasty technical issues. For one mission, Garrus disappeared for about 20-30 minutes. Sadly, he was integral to the mission, so characters kept turning to talk to him, but there was nobody there. Much of the time I couldn't hear what he was supposed to be saying. Also, there are tracking issues during conversations. They tried to make the characters turn to face the current speaker, but this mostly just confuses them when there's more than one speaker. The most hilarious was when Liara's helper bot flew by during a conversation, and Shepard flipped out. He started thrashing about with his eyes rolled back in his head. Reminded me of the Exorcist. I'm not convinced the ending was bad, but I don't think it was very explicit about how your choices impacted the ending. Looking around online I found the ending thresholds, so it turns out it does matter what you do. It's just hard to directly see the impacts. The different endings are apparently pretty similar. The technical issues are my main gripe. I would say I still liked this better than the first Mass Effect but less than the second. I did not find it as disappointing as Dragon Age 2. I feel like people are comparing Mass Effect 3 to some ideal of what they hoped the game would be instead of comparing the game to its peers. Comparing the game to its peers shows that it some things well. It's a beautiful game graphically, and I enjoyed the cameos from throughout the series and seeing how choices I made came back to affect the third game.",7,2012-04-11,PC,user

ME3 became a action-shooter, there is only auto-dialogue, a few choices that i can count with my fingers. The game forces you to do some things, there is no roleplay anymore. I won't talk about the plotholes because in youtube you can find a lot of videos highlighting everyone one of them. They have done the same thing with DA2, they are trying to reach another kind of gamers, but to do that they are sacrificing their own fanbase. ME3 feels exactly like DA2: RUSHED. They didn't had the time to review their own creation what a crap! Hire another writer. Only your writers can screw a incredible story like ME in a matter of seconds.

mackswift,"This is probably one of the few times I've written my review ****, and those other few times were games like the original Deus Ex and Red Alert 1 & 2. But this.....this....ending, even a week after finished the game; nay the trilogy, and I've still got a bad taste in my mouth. Here I was on Earth with my squad and we just handed another Reaper its ass. And we're hightailing it to that transporter up to the Citadel. No clue what was going to be up there. And then one big laser blast from **** it was the series finale to the Sopranos all over again. The first game was a great sci-fi RPG that introduced us to the universe and laid out the plot, problem, and all the tantalizing little bits and hints of what was to come. Mass Effect 2 was phenominal. I was so drawn into the story, I literally played all weekend until I finished. I was stoked for the third game, and while playing it; I was having a blast. I jumped into the multiplayer and had some fun there too. Remember the Reaper on Rinoch and all the choices you made right after that. My choice seriously **** things up and I ended up taking a mulligan! I never took a mulligan like that before; so understandably I was even further stoked as to what the end of the game was gonna entail. Yeah, um, Bill Lumburg style, um, yeeeahhh, that ending...... It ****. What happened to my squadmates? To Garrus? Tali? Liara? What a letdown. Not to mention that I read what was intended to be the ending that Drew Karpyshyn had drawn up for the series; that the use of the 'Mass Effect' fields was creating a large buildup of dark energy that was going to destroy the galaxy. And the Reapers were creatures that absorbed technologically advanced races and used their genetics in the hopes of finding an answer to stop the dark energy buildup. Now that would have been a cool frakking ending!!!!!! Not that Sopranos style series finale mess we were left with.",4,2012-04-07,PC,user

VectorX,"The people writing about the horrible ending have a point, but it isn't as extreme as many people peg it to be. There are seven endings and the perfect ending requires a lot of work. Honestly, the ending wasn't all that bad (I've seen far worse) and it wasn't a plot breaker or an ending that made no sense. The developers created an ending that brought closure to the entire universe. In order to avoid the spoilers check, I won't go into what actually happened. Still, in terms of an ending, it was very well done (It has a modular ending much like the Fallout series, where what you do affects the outcome). The plot was stellar and the character development (following the same style as Mass Effect and Mass Effect II had the Paragon/Renegade dichotomy) was incredible. The all inclusive relationship system between the people your character interacts with was very strong and the ability to cultivate a relationship with anybody of any gender of any race was a very interesting aspect. The combat mechanics were solid. I found the third person shooting style very conducive to the game, and while I am a die hard FPS fan, it was necessary to allow you to control your team mate AI while being able to keep aware of your combat situational awareness. I found the battle mechanics addictive. I literally found myself skipping the intro scenes to less important missions just to get into the fight. Being able to try out all the different battle styles also made me play through the game multiple times. I highly recommend this game for people who want a mix between good plot lines and good shooting mechanics. For those people who rate the game down because of the ending, you need to realize this game isn't YOUR story, it's the developers. That's how they chose to end the series, get over it. For the people who say your choices in the previous installments don't matter, have you played the game through without using your save data? Things happen VERY differently...including your ability to cultivate relationships with certain characters and your ability to influence the outcomes of intergalactic politics...",9,2012-04-05,PC,user
shadowchaser076,"Mass Effect 3 is an absolute amazing brilliant game until the very last ten minutes. The very last ten minutes ruin the entire franchise. SPOILERS AHEAD...... Our Choices we made from the very beginning with ME1 doesn't matter. Seriously, Bioware threw everything out the window in the very last ten minutes. The problem with the ending is that its broken storytelling. You just cannot introduce a totally brand new character that has never been mentioned, such as the Starchild/Catalyst, at the very end of any series. Also, you just can't introduce a whole NEW theory as to why the Reapers were created to do. That was never mentioned at all only up to the last 10 minutes. For these to work, they were have to be mentioned throughout ME1 and ME2. Also it has been mentioned many times that we would have gotten 16 different endings due to our choices throughout the series. We didn't get that. In the end, all the choices we made though out the game and war assets doesn't matter, because Bioware threw that out the window with lousy storytelling in the last 10 minutes. It would be like, in Fight Club, we find out who Tyler Durden really is, and the screen goes black. It would be like, we find out Darth Vader is Luke's father at the end of Return of the Jedi, the Death Star blows up and wipes out along Endor with it. Bioware are still defending this as this being a piece of art. If an artist promises their client you're going to get this and that, you'll love the finished product, then 2 years later, the artist gives the client completely something different. What makes you think the client would not get upset over this. Bioware has just become another game company to make money and screw their fans over along with EA.

Nauglamir,"I won't add to it any further. Some of the reviews down here do already get to the point of what was wrong with this game. To summarize it, the settings in the game along with the streamlined dialogues do lack any depths, while the graphics are blatantly dragged from the previous game, with no polishing whatsoever and at times performing low frame-rate levels. From the second half of the game onward, the main plot rises to an acceptable level of narration, only to sink as it draws near to the end. The gameplay is nothing special either. It's mostly fine, but it's clunky and way too ""shooterized"". Basically, the game has been simplified in order to reach a wider console audience, while the end, sadly enough, encourage the players to buying new DLCs to get further information about the fate of the galaxy. As a result, i recommend purchasing it on budget in the next months to come, as it still delivers some good stories on the mass effect universe, though lacking a major consistency.",5,2012-04-05,PC,user

OrangeFish,"The first half of the game is quite enjoyable as you progress into the second half of the game it is clear that quite a few missions are missing. Developer interviews confirm this(from the Final Hours of ME3 iPad app). The most damning indictment about the quality of this title is saved for the ultimate conclusion of the game. The ending does not work, does not make sense, and feels like its tacked on from a different universe. It certainly does not feel like it belongs in Mass Effect`s universe. Another 6-9 months of development time likely could have fixed the problems, unfortunately that didn`t happen so I would suggest unless this is fixed sometime during 2012 I would recommend skipping this game. Perhaps the best thing you can do is to is play Mass Effect 1 and just pretend the whole thing ends right there.",2,2012-04-04,PC,user

Morring,"The whole game, except the last five minutes, is above average. It has some GREAT moments and some considerable shortcomings, The technical department is poor, the few improvements over the previous game are balanced by many flaws, which become obstacles during gameplay. Action could be a lot of fun, too bad you only have one button to crouch, run, and jump over obstacles. Most of the times you'll die it's going to be because of this. Some good moments about the plot, but some errors and contradictions are very easy to notice. The soundtrack, that's probably the only thing that really went right. Given all this facts I'd give it a 7/10 BUT: the ending. The plot becomes meaningless, all your choices: discarded. The explanations are incredibly dumb at best, and even if you assume it was all just a dream, or an indoctrination induced vision, it keep not making sense. Even if it did, you still don't see what happens to the galaxy you learned to love in the course of three games. What you get is the same cutscene, with an explosion of a different color based on a choice you make in the last 30 seconds of gameplay. This is no hyperbole, it's actually what you get. The whole plot is based on something the devs explicitly said they would'n do: add a ""kill reapers"" button. They aren't even above adding the cliche child dying seeking some easy drama, and getting shepard out of character a bit more. I'd make it 4/10 then, even with no reasonable plot it's still a nice action game with some control issues and a few good moments with your old companions, right? No, because a game is not just the final product. Everything reeks of the scent of some money-craving horrible beast. You get day one DLC that is already on disk. That character was intended to be meaningful to the plot, and you can see why: it's a prothean. But they just accepted to sacrifice some of the plot meaningfulness so that it could be an optional you could sell. As you finish the game, a message appears: you are reset before you start the last mission, and you're invited to buy some DLCs to further shepard's adventures. This behaviour is unacceptable. Remember when DLCs were stuff they made months AFTER the game was released, and you got to play THE WHOLE GAME simply by paying its price? Maybe it's me, maybe I should't have standards. But I do, and so do many people. That's why after a second playtrough I'm modifying my review and giving this a zero. That's why this game has such a low score. I understand you may really want to play this, but DO NOT BUY. These people can only understand money.",0,2012-04-04,PC,user

KRHamilton,"Mass Effect 3 is a great game for the most part, but is has some critical flaws that eliminate almost all the replay value of the entire series. The biggest problem is the ending which ruins the whole series for me and many other fans because of its low quality, inconsistencies, flawed logic, and clear indication that none of your choices ultimately matter much for a series that requires a minimum of 100 hours from part 1 to part 3, if you complete every quest and mission. The ending goes against one of the most fundamental features of the game series; BioWare continuously advertised the series as one where almost every choice matters. I'm a big fan of Mass Effect 1 and 2, with the exception of planet scanning in part 2; I hated that boring activity. I played through both games at least 5 times including all DLC. Now I feel I wasted hundreds of hours in those games to reach the disappointing conclusion in Mass Effect 3. It's sad to see how far BioWare has declined since they were purchased by EA in late 2007. How could such a wonderful series have deteriorated this much in 5 years? I believe the problem is an ongoing issue caused by EA's budget priorities; too much money goes into their marketing of games and not enough to their development studios. Another problem was EA forcing BioWare to add multiplayer late in the development cycle. This took valuable resources from the development of the single player campaign and it shows from beginning to the end with choppy animations, limited character development, greatly reduced number of squad members, over simplified buggy user interface, sound card problems, lackluster quest journal, an excessive number of planet scanning fetch quests, a disappointingly generic final mission, and an unoriginal anticlimactic conclusion. Even the simple ability to holster your weapon when you don't need it was removed. Having to run around safe areas with only allies standing around while being forced point my gun at them is a major immersion killer for me. Also when you holstered your gun it was possible to better appreciate the beautiful and interesting environments in the game and see how cool your armor looks from every angle. A noticeable reduction in quality is the first thought that came to mind from the moment I started my first mission on Mass Effect 3, because of all these issues. The good news is that Mass Effect 3 has many shining moments of brilliance where everything comes together flawlessly. My two favorite parts were the awe inspiring missions in Tuchanka and Rannoch. I also enjoyed most of the conversation topics with Joker, EDI, Garrus, Liara, and Tali. Adding the ability to dodge and dive for cover as well as the melee combat and grabs took the gameplay to a whole new level of fun. I can't recall any other game, in the past 15 years that had so much potential and so utterly squandered it after building up dramatic tension to such an amazing level while getting so many things right across three installments. I purchased and completed all DLC for the trilogy; that is over $250 cash plus my emotional investment in the Mass Effect franchise. I paid $80 for the Mass Effect 3 Digital Deluxe Edition plus sales tax, my most expensive digital download since I started gaming 15 years ago, and it can't be returned for a refund through Origin. I don't feel Mass Effect 3 is a good deal, until at least some of its significant problems are fixed. Fortunately, BioWare has promised to investigate issues being reported to them as constructive criticism; I hope they fix the major problems with Mass Effect 3 so I can enjoy this series again. I've read rumors that EA plans to charge for fixing the problems with Mass Effect 3; if they planned to charge extra for a better conclusion to a beloved franchise, it would be a new low in the history of gaming. New DLC should only be sold if isn't directly related to fixing the ending. To illustrate the problem compare this: ****/watch?v=rPelM2hwhJA To this: ****/forum/1/topic/355/index/10056886 ****/2012/03/18/the-broken-promises-of-mass-effect-3-spoilers/ Because of the discrepancies between Mass Effect 3 and what was advertised by EA, at least one fan has filed a formal complaint with the US Federal Trade Commission. That is unfortunate, but it shows a level of dissatisfaction with a top rated game that I haven't seen before. I love Mass Effect and want it to be remembered in the best possible way. I want it to have replay value as a complete series, because it is the best science fiction interactive entertainment series in the market. There is nothing wrong with improving a product. BioWare doesn't owe it to fans to change Mass Effect 3; they owe it to themselves, after all the hard work they have put in to the series.",5,2012-04-04,PC,user

I mean, the endings **** and it was filled with plot holes and didn't make any sense. But I don't believe a game should be rated only by its ending.

mycccroft,"The Good: Some of the character writing is the best I've seen in a video game. The Bad: Frequent bugs (I started saving before I stepped foot on the bridge). With the exception of a few superb missions, the story writing falls apart in this game (especially in the second half). The overall plot is weak and the ending is as bad as advertised. The entire last mission (London) feels like it was done by a different team. I don't know whether this game was rushed, a victim of corporate politics, or had some massive turnover in the writing staff, but this was a massive disappointment. What makes it transcend the average failure are the moments of brilliance. The game keeps **** you back in and then smacking you every time you engage in it. A bad game is just dull.

antoinedumont50,"When the time for change has come, one must welcome it. Mass Effect 3 is in no way a bad game. This game is shot down in flames either by people who dismiss the day 1 DLC or homophobes. Mass Effect was the best of the three, but ME3 is a huge improvement on ME2. I played it on a high-end PC and it looks gorgeous. No glitches, no slowing down. I agree that Dragon Age 2 was a real failure, but it is not the case here. Alright, it is more action-oriented than ME1, kind of in the vein of ME2. But it is definitely not a bad thing. The plot could have been much better, but I think that it fits the series well. Now, there's also the question of the endings. At first, I must say that I was really disappointed. But in the end, it was a very good lesson of life. Sometimes, you must make a choice even though you don't have many options. Life is hard and death is a part of it. The users have taken it too far here. Come on, the user score is almost as bad as Postal 3! Users also complain about the addition of a multiplayer feature. Let me tell you something : it's just amazing. And challenging too.

Billy_Basso,"I normally never review anything online, but after seeing the absolutely asinine amount of negative reviews I felt obligated to speak up. First off, Mass Effect 3 is a fantastic game overall. The universe it continues to build on from the first to games is probably the richest in videogame history. The voice acting is mostly excellent. The combat's more refined than in Mass Effect 2. Although it only uses the unreal 3 engine, the graphics are still very nice -- the upshot being that it will run well on a wide range of systems. I've never felt so emotionally invested in a game's universe and plot as I've felt while playing Mass Effect 3. The fact that Bioware actually managed to carry so many things over from the first two games, and follow through with there original ambitions is extremely impressive. Okay. Sure. The ending could certainly be better. But to say it retroactively ruins the rest of the game is ridiculous. I must assume all the disproportionately negative reviews are being written by a very outspoken minority. If this were any other game, the ending would never get this much attention. If anything, it's a testament to the exceedingly high quality and player's investment in the series; any perceived flaw is going to be that much more difficult to deal with. Also, I almost forgot, Origin is really dumb. I hate using it, and I felt shameful downloading Mass Effect 3 through it. Once I starting playing the game, however, I quickly forgot about it. And I can't punish the developer for EA's lame, anti-consumer, business decisions. I hopefully will never have to download another origin game again. As the game goes, ff you enjoyed either of the first two Mass Effects at all, you should play Mass Effect 3. The developers put an immense amount of hard work into wrapping up their trilogy. Just about every aspect of the game is topnotch, and the series, as a whole, sets a new standard for story telling in the medium. Bioware deserves recognition for their hard work. If you were at all excited for Mass Effect 3 before launch, buy it. Ignore all the immature slander and pay attention to the critics reviews. Most normal people will love Mass Effect 3.",10,2012-04-01,PC,user

The mix of Mass Effect 1 and 2 as far as gameplay was concerned was great, combat has never been as fun and the environments were dynamic and interesting for the most part. Team interactions were good, although a bit sparse for my liking (character interactions were what drew me to the series) However there are many major flaws. Yes the ending is pretty weak for a lot a of reasons. A lack of catharsis with your teammates, it's too open ended with far too few questions answered. Another problem with it that irks me, but doesn't seem to have come up in other reviews is how little the choices I made in the game seemed to effect the ending. I worked my butt off **** together every little resource I could find and every ally and army I could muster and for the most part it seemed to have no impact on the end fight at all. There was a 5 second extra cutscene of two of the armadas I put together but that was it? Why did I bother? Why did I only see Turrians, Humans and Krogans and Assari at the end? Why did I have a lame human strike force when I worked so hard at making allies with various alien races? The Journey was great but the end seemed... well pointless.

Bioware did not bring back any type of inventory, the Itemization is still too small and understanding of the mechanics does little to help one play better or lay out skills better. Even more disturbing is the horrendous way Bioware has concluded this game. I will not give any specifics but suffice to say the ending offers no real choice or closure. If given the opportunity, I would return my copy.",2,2012-04-01,PC,user
casellacrack,"Mass Effect 3 is the least successful episode in the saga: you play it because it is a bond that lasts for years, because the vulgar scifi also always has a shot (even if only in some microexperience side), because the mechanical augmentation between phases play with the characters and relationships always work, but basically is a way to appeal to the full only to those who still enjoys this kind of epic onanistic",0,2012-04-01,PC,user
meediocre,"The good: great galactic apocalyptic story (albeit a bit weird at the end), excellent third-person shooter action with varied enemies and situations, lush environments, excellent voice-acting, multi-player is surprisingly addictive and frenetic. Slightly annoying: wearing a type of armour that boosts your shields has a visor, meaning that in some of the ""emotional"" cut-scenes you can't see Shephard's face! Also, I hate not having a button specific to ""cover"". The amount of times I got stuck to a wall or something and I didn't want to! Also, when you're speeding around in the Normandy and get spotted by the Reapers, it's not much fun trying to evade them as their ships are somehow faster. Finally my one criticism of the multi-player option is that the environments could have been more varied, plus it would have been nice to have to fight a combination of enemies, such as Cerberus and Reapers etc .. The bad: The game is possibly a little too easy, so it could have been slightly more challenging, especially at the end. The ending is, as you all know by now, a little bit ""WTF"", and I agree that its ambiguity is ultimately a bit frustrating.",8,2012-04-01,PC,user
izazael,"Fans of the first two Mass Effect games might find the return of the weapons/mods system a little frustrating and the dialogue a little lacklustre and forced. Aside from those two things, the rest of the game is on par with the previous two: action, adventure, awe-inspiring cinematics. The decisions made by your Shephard do have serious consequences in the third game but no one seems to want to recognise that fact, focusing instead of how little impact they have on the very final cut-scenes and decisions of the game. I don't see any reason why they should. Regardless of how much people think the ending was disappointing or pick on a few minor problems with the game mechanics, ME3 is still a very good game and hardly deserves a zero score. It falls short of being a 10 experience, but play it through, finish it, give it a few days and you'll start to appreciate how good the game actually is.",8,2012-03-31,PC,user

tekken7,"Mass Effect 3 was a major disappointment. I have purchased and played the entire Mass Effect 1-3 series; beginning in 2007 with ME1. Job well done to Bioware for creating such a fun and entertaining product. Unfortunately, EA/Bioware failed to deliver on what it promised customers (per the company's own prior marketing & press release) for Mass Effect 3. Many reviewers of ME3 who are critical of the game list many, if not the same problems. Here is my list: (1) players are provided with nothing remotely close to the unique, personal experience they were promised by Bioware; (2) I was left with a sense that all of my carefully weighed choices were really illusory and accounted for nothing; (3) lore errors and plot holes; (4) based on the prior themes, story telling style the ending is out-of-character, confusing & underdeveloped. Such a creative and talented Bioware team could have -- AND SHOULD HAVE -- delivered a more in-depth series of true, multiple endings with a better sense of lucidity and closure to conclude the wonderful Mass Effect series. Let us all remember that EA/Bioware is running a business -- an enterprise to make money to produce shareholder value and employ many, many people in North America, Europe and Asia. The golden rule in business (that is if you wish to stay in business) is to produce products that consumers want to buy.

Dialogue is simplified with less options and less renegade/paragon actions. Game is also more linear with less side missions and exploration. Also has one of the worst quest tracking systems I have ever experienced in any game. Dialogue and combat animations are horrible as well. Multi-player is awful, just a horde mode tacked on to the game. Gets tiresome after a couple matches. Entire game feels like it was rushed and the ending is absolutely trash.

I cant think of any positive thing about ME3, none, only the terrible things remain. Suddenly, I realized how poor of a sci-fi ME is, things that didnt matter suddenly became game-breaking for me. For example, the animations, the ""every species speaks english"", the sci-fi clichÃs, the bisexuality, etc. All in all, the story is just plain boring, not to mention it has many plot holes.

There isn't a single game that comes close to the quality of storytelling and presentation out there. The problem is that the last 15 minutes of the game throws out the window over 100 hours of game play leading to that point. The ending is a mess. It is horrible, it makes no sense, it is full of plot holes, it introduces what is effectively and deus ex machina, it resolves nothing of your choices and it provides you with no closure. It is a hideous ending to one of the best sci-fi epics of all time. The game itself is amazing, emotional, touching, scary, funny, sometimes all at once.

Pandor,"I can't say I enjoyed this game much at all. From the addition of multiplayer (which is required to get the best ending, unless you're willing to pay extra for iphone/android apps) which is uninspired at best, to the plot hole-ridden story, to the day 1 dlc fiasco, right up to the absolutely horrible ending, I can't say I could recommend this game to anyone. Worst of all is that, for a game series that markets itself as being all about how your choices affect the storyline, the game does an excellent job of ignoring all of the choices you made in the previous two games. Then there's the aforementioned matter of the ending, which is one choice dressed up as three choices. Bearing in mind that right up to a week before the game was released, it was marketed as having something on the order of 17 different endings, this game is completely disappointing. It's not even a matter of liking really good games. If you like only halfway decent games, this still isn't up to your standards.",0,2012-03-29,PC,user

I Loved this game just as much as the previous ones in the series. Sure its my opinion but enjoy the experience people, Bioware has taken one of the top 5 spots on my favourite game developer company's, and I respect and loved them and their work. Also another note that people seem to not understand, the multiplayer is NOT REQUIRED to get the best endings, You can unlock the others threw longer and better play threw out the singleplayer campaign.

Varnor,"I have characters that I have imported from ME1 and 2 and have truly enjoyed ever minute of the game, having spent almost 50 hours so far in the single player mode alone. It's not perfect, it doesn't deserve a 10, no game ever does but to see emails and have things mentioned in the game that span back to the 1st and second games, even extremely minor things is fun to see, as is the abundance of text background, found everywhere from the Journal to datapads during missions, to Broker and Spectre emails that flesh out the background. The game also references at least one of the Mass Effect books (Retribution) and introduces a character from it How your character behaves towards others and during missions alters what you can eventually use against the Reapers is great, the fact that there is now no Mako or Mineral scanning is more of a plus really, it was only ever a time filler to make the game last longer anyway. There are brief planet scanning jobs to look for War Assets but these take little more than around 10 seconds to complete, work the same way that searching for an anomaly on a planet did in ME2, and are not compulsory The graphics are as excellent as ever (although I've seen a few minor clipping issues and once Garrus ""vanished"" during a conversation, lol) as is the sound and voice acting I was very skeptical about the Multi Player side of ME3, the previous 2 being completely Single Player, but have to admit I have enjoyed it greatly! Currently it's up to 4 player co-op against Cerberus, Geth or Reapers. Your characters level up, allowing you to put points into Biotic / Tech / etc skills, you earn in-game money which can be spent on Packs that provide everything from medi-gel and spare ammo to disposable missile launchers, new main weapons, attachments, etc In a market where high street stores sting the developer by reselling their games at pure profit, I can't blame them for releasing DLC and having Online Passes. I always buy brand new copies anyway and don't mind paying for DLC so that doesn't affect the scoring at all to me I don't place much faith in Metacritic User reviews, and the pure volume of release date scores of 0/10 speak volumes to me. If I spent 35+ hours on the game the first time round, then Day 1 reviewers have missed at least 65% of content, and that's without DLC",9,2012-03-29,PC,user
Khaos25,"Unlike most people here, I took my time with the game. I have only just finished my first play-through of the game and have thought really long and hard before writing this review. Mass Effect 3 is brilliant, I'll say. The scale is massive and I really felt the pressure of having to save the galaxy being overrun by the Reapers. It was a blast to see old characters again and the story is very well written even though I'll admit the dialogue is rather cheesy in most parts. Combat in the game is fun, a little bit repetitive but fun. Nothing better than pulling out the omni-blade and jamming it into an enemy (very satisfying). But the heavy melee could have been implemented better, it looked cheap and lame if compared to other games like Deus Ex Human Revolution. Not only that, the sidequests in this game was horrible!!! Not only are they vague, they are more a pain than actual reasons to explore the galaxy. You just go around scanning for lost items and such. Only good thing, no more tedious scanning like in the second game. Multiplayer is fun but it gets old after a while, Mass Effect is not really meant to be a multiplayer game and the controls obviously show that. And yes, the endings. The endings are exactly what everyone is complaining about. Not only is it inconsistent to the plot, its abrupt!!! Its like: BOOM, finish, thank you, goodbye. Feels like all your time you put out out into all three games was wasted the effort. Outside the game, the **** Origin client system was also a pain for me, took me 4 hours just to get the game up and running although I have not had any problems for the past few weeks. So, why give an 8? ME3 is not going to win Game of the Year nor will it gain legacy as one of the best sequels ever. It is however, just plain fun to play ME3. Its fun to be on one last adventure with your favourite characters even though by now you know, it will end in huge disappointment. But, now Bioware is making an attempt to address the issue and as for me, I will be replaying the game with a vastly different Shepard of mine. Did I waste my money buying this game? I don't think so, I am keeping this game. As for you guys, I say either you take a chance buying this game or you find somewhere willing to give you a refund or exchange in case you really don't like the game. This game is one I think all ME fans should get regardless of the ending, just steel your hearts when you see the ending, that is all.",10,2012-03-29,PC,user
vDevilEnd,"The game-play is vastly improved and combined from the previous 2 games, it's very fluid & fast paced with the action. The dialogue, characters, writing, and story is/are some of the best in gaming. The voice acting is also some of the very best ever heard. You might want to bring some tissues because the end of the trilogy is one of the most emotional games of all time. If it's you're first time stepping into Mass Effect 3 I would highly suggest picking up the other first two games as well. Multiplayer does not feel tacked on to this game at all, it meshes well with the story, and very fun which was unexpected by many. About the ending, I will touch on it very briefly because everyone here seems to down vote this game into oblivion because of that only. The ending can be confusing, and possibly not offer any true closure but it is open for discussion or speculation, which in my opinion is alright because you can sort of make you're own ending, this is good because I feel nobody will ever really be fully satisfied with what Bioware will put for the ending of this trilogy. In closing the game is worth the money, and keeping as you will want to spend many hours playing Mass Effect 3 and it's 2 previous games which gets better with each game. I highly doubt anybody who isn't trolling will find very few flaws with this game, it's damn near perfect and one of the best games of all time.",10,2012-03-29,PC,user

So you can't turn around and give it a **** score simply because you have a problem only with the creative decisions of its ending.

stb97,"I have to say, I loved Mass Effect 3, or at least I thought I did. The combat is definitely greatly improved, it is now much more fluid, and shooter fans will have an easy transition to this game, as the combat is rewarding and the abilities are much more fun and necessary to be effective on the higher difficulties. On the other hand, for people playing for the story, the combat can be tuned down so that it is still the same shooty-killy action sequence, but it takes significantly less time so you can easily get through to the story driven sections of the game. However, the one part they seemed to have skipped on is exploration, in Mass Effect one, we had the Mako, which provided a plethora of opportunities for exploration and side missions, in Mass Effect 2, we could scan planets, this provided an alternate currency system for upgrading your ship as well as still providing an avenue for side missions. However, in Mass Effect 3, there's really no exploration elements, which takes a sizable chunk of gameplay out of the game, as well as limiting us to the hub stations and the one time mission areas, making the game feel increasingly confined. But the problem with appealing to both the story and combat players, is that neither field seems that amazing, the story was quite frankly shallow with very few side plots or twists, and the combat alone was no where near good enough to carry the entire game. The ending was bad, but it wasn't enough to ruin the game for me, and the multiplayer was just, while enjoyable, a ploy to draw in more customers.",5,2012-03-28,PC,user

The ending was just awful. when i first seen it I thought i did something wrong, i was literally stunned. At the end you are given 3 choices DeusEx:HR style. The endings do not take in to consideration any of your decisions you made during your journey as Shepard. It gives you three choices, but in the end your choice comes down to the color of explosion that will probably destroy all civilizations as we know them, no matter what you do. The ending did not just didnt give you any choices or didn't provide closer, and it was completely out of place.

jvward,"Mass effect 3 is a pretty nice looking game, and the mechanics are great. That being said this game has to be reviewed also on its overall story as a culmination of a trilogy which thus far had received critical acclaim for its story telling assisted through player choice. Keeping this in mind, the game can be compared to ""getting a hand job from a supermodel who just before your about to finish gets up walks in the other room, leaves you hanging there, grabs lighter fluid tosses it on you and then sets you a blaze"". Not the ended you expected or were the least bit satisfied with. Whats most upsetting is that Bioware and EA most likely intended this hoping to corner game owners into purchasing some sort of DLC to give them the satisfying ending they wanted.

Kenmei,"I feel like the biggest problem with this game was the blatant disregard for the consumer when they put together the story for this final piece. While I didn't think it was the worst ending to a Sci-Fi trilogy (Hello Matrix), I do think there were a few things that they could have done differently. The biggest problems I had with this game though were alot of the things they missed. The lack of side missions, the lack of places to explore, and the fact that Bioware thinks we are all idiots with the issue with the DLC really puts a stain on this otherwise great gaming trilogy. I am glad that they are going back to address the issue of the ending but, with everything else that accompanied this game, the series really took a step back from ME 2, which I still think is one of the best sequels of all time. Bioware really lost touch with their consumers with this game and I do believe that is the EA influence doing the devil's work. The issue with the DLC will forever taint this game, no matter what they do with the ending. Still the ending of this series can be salvaged and the fans can be appeased somewhat with an ending they might like. However, in it's current form and even if the ending somehow changes everyone's mind about this game, this is still the worst game in the Mass Effect series and it's truly disappointing for me to write that. The utter disrespect shown to us players by Bioware with the DLC is the worst thing about this game and that will never go away no matter what they do with the ending. Still, if you've gone this far with the series, I would advise you to give it a chance just to see what you think.

mineda,"Let me start by saying that Mass Effect 3 is a good game. Story is not as deep as previous titles of the franchise but you have really good moments. Unfortunately the ending is generic, short and fails to deliver any closure. It's a game that you don't feel like playing again once you finish it, because there's just one ending. Graphics are ok most of the time. There are some graphical glitches (like people looking to the roof while speaking to each other), but they are not game breaking. ME3 has the worst quest system of the franchise. The quest journal is annoying and quests are just variations of ""retrieve artifact X from the Y system"". The Reapers mini game is not cool at all and the scanning system from ME2 was dumbed down. Combat is really entertaining. There's some flaws (like using the spacebar to do a lot of different things), but the overall experience is really good. Multiplayer is a lot of fun. The only problem being the lack of maps to play. Overall Mass Effect 3 is a really good game. Not a masterpiece but something worth playing.",7,2012-03-27,PC,user
phantomlord91,"A series with great potential ruined by a terrible ending that makes you wonder how was it approved to be in a game. It truly baffles me why the writers gave us this ending which is full of plot holes and has no closure whatsoever. It also offers no choice other than choosing the colour of the big explosion in the end, even though the developers promised before the game's release that the game would offer many different and distinct endings. It's truly a shame to see a great company like bioware become nothing but liars and incompetent of creating a decent video game in years. Dragon Age 2, Star Wars The Old Republic and now Mass Effect 3. It's sad to say but the old good bioware is dead, gone forever.",4,2012-03-27,PC,user
inverted720,"Zero because the game was broken out of the box. I can't save the game period! So I have replayed the intro/up to the mars stage of the game 4 times now, and it is awful. Terrible unskippable cinematics. I can't even start playing the game further to rate it. So it gets a zero. The action so far is terrible, and the story is again lame and unskippable. I just have to sit there banging the keyboard hoping to find a way to skip, so I can see if my latest troubleshoot to make the save games work is working. 5 tries over 4 hours and no luck yet. Thanks for the headache Origin. Having to use Origin the wannabe steam, is the final nail in the coffin. Bye bye $60 i'll never see you again, all I can do is leave this nasty review. Saaaaaad.

Raynulf,"The Mass Effect series as a whole is an amazing piece of storytelling, backed by enjoyable and interesting gameplay and a cast of well crafted characters. The rating given reflects the complete experience of Mass Effect 3. Had the game concluded with the themes and narrative quality of the majority of the game, it would rate 8/10. The game is immersive, reasonably well paced and takes pains to reintroduce the majority of 'fan favourite' characters at least for a cameo and is thoroughly enjoyable, if by no means 'perfect'. In terms of gameplay, the combat is much improved, with the protagonist being far more mobile on the battlefield - however linking all movement commands to a single button which is interpreted situationally can be immensely frustrating - and the enemies are tactically more varied and force rapid shifts in player tactics. Unfortunately, the opponents are far from varied: Throughout the game there are essentially two factions you fight against in almost every encounter. Despite the focus on one-squad-vs-the-horde throughout the game, it does introduce a little variety in the form of shooting-gallery turret sections and a section in virtual reality. As a roleplay game (RPG), Mass Effect 3 is far more restricted than its predecessors, with fewer dialogue options and ultimately less choices, however the immersiveness of the first two acts will cause most players to generally forgive this, at least on their first play-through. If there is a complaint to be had (excluding the ending), it is in the fact that little of the prior decisions made in the series are actually taken into account within the Mass Effect 3 storyline: Species the player rendered extinct can be found throughout the game, artifacts the player destroyed utterly can be found on display, and so forth. While it is by no means uncommon or even unusual for sequential games to make assumptions and establish a 'cannon' series of events, the fact that Mass Effect 3 was specifically marketed as this not being the case causes it not to live up to expectations in that regard. Additionally, regardless of player choice, Mass Effect 3 will force feed the protagonist with a lot of previously nonpresent anguish over certain events, which is very much out of keeping with the concept of player-determination. Still, despite these flaws, it easily rates 8/10 for the first two acts, when viewed on its own merits. And for these first two acts, I would recommend this game to any fan of the Mass Effect series, with the caveat they immediately stop playing the game afterwards, and do not complete it. And then, theres the ending. On the chance that somehow, someone is not aware of this fact: A lot of customers are not happy with the ending (to put it mildly), and frankly, their dissatisfaction is perfectly justified. The final act of the game dismisses the overall game theme of player choice and consequences thereof, railroading the player along a series of events - some agreeable, many not - until the point the game ends. Specifically the game, not the story. In the final hour of one of the greatest epics told in the computer game medium, Mass Effect 3 utterly fails to deliver, from a narrative, psychological and philosophical perspective. Themes established from the beginning are discarded, new and inexplicable characters are introduced the very end, illogical and circular 'exposition' contradicts established story and background and last but not least, established characters are forced to act completely against their nature as the player is shoe-horned into an A/B/C choice, regardless of their prior actions through the series. Even the very narrative style is switched in the very last minute. To make matters worse: The ending also, for no reason, destroys the entire premise of the game universe with utterly inexplicable and near-identical, emotionless CGI animations. So sadly, despite 5 years of excellence in the series, 15 minutes of cutscenes (with no player control) quickly and thoroughly ruin the overall experience, and the game must be rated with that in mind. As a disclaimer: Bioware are, and hopefully will continue to be, an excellent developer, who have produced some of the most enjoyable stories in the gaming media, which is one of the reasons the terribly written ending to ME3 is so surprising. I would recommend people do NOT boycott the brand, or anything equally extreme, but instead avoid pre-ordering their products or relying on pre-release reviews, and instead wait for peer reviews, such as these here on Metacritic.",4,2012-03-26,PC,user
LeBronaldReagan,"Bioware screwed up so masterfully at the end of this game that it not only ruins the game, it ruins the first two Mass Effect games as well. The only positive side of the ending is that it doesn't also ruin Dragon Age: Origins. I would only suggest buying this game if you are the type of person who skips through all the dialog scenes and cutscenes. If you enjoy dialog, story, and making choices that impact the rest of the game DO NOT BUY this game. The one major problem with this game is the ending. It is a fun enjoyable game similar to its predecessors up until the finale. How this ending seemed like a good idea to the studio is mind-boggling. It is bad storytelling in addition to other factors which leaves the player frustrated and unfulfilled. Forget replay value, you will have no motivation or desire to replay this game or Mass Effect 1 and 2. Save your money. Don't buy this abomination. If anything, wait and see if Bioware will release a fixed ending. The price of this game should be falling quickly anyway due to poor reception.",0,2012-03-26,PC,user
Ananisapta,"I don't understand the negative user reviews for ME III. I think the professional critics are correct to rate it highly. I'm an experienced gamer for RPGs and MMORPGs, and I consider ME III to rate among the highest in emotional impact. The weaknesses I would cite are minor. I would certainly recommend playing the first two episodes in the series because that facilitates understanding the story and developing an emotional attachment to certain NPCs. Episode III has a complex plot in which individual missions can have enough emotional impact that I need to rest between them. It's not primarily a shooter, more an extended drama in which you control the plot dynamics to a respectable degree. I strongly recommend this to grownup gamers who are attracted to space opera. I will agree that the ending was the weakest part of the series. Part of my disappointment relates to the passivity... if I wanted to watch TV I would do that; gaming is better than TV because it makes you active in shaping the dramatic experience. I gather EA is working on improving the ending and I hope they'll find ways to make it snappier!",8,2012-03-26,PC,user

Aepervius,"Mass effect is a great ending to the trilogy , albeit with a sever flaw. The graphic are great , but there is no way to change the setting, and console limitation are forcing some design decision. For one you can't change FoV, you can't change graphic setting much, and you are forced to watch the back of a shepard taking 1/5 of the screen the whole time (Typical console trick to avoid calculating world geometry in a part of the screen). Often I found myself unconsciously using the mouse wheel to zoom out or in to go into FP , and sadly this is not possible. Graphic option include anti aliasing, screen resolution, brightness, and shadow, that's it. Still the graphic are great, only it is a bit sad to be saddled with console limitation. Sound wise , It is relatively good. Music is good. Sound effect sound stock or did not leave me with a strong impression. Dialogs OTOH are good sounding, and the sound of the reaper still leaves me a chill in the back. Plot : I found the story fitting. The ending was OKish. On its own I found it OK, what I was sorely missing was to know what happens to the various folk/species taking part into the battle. I won't spoil it for you for the content of the ending, but I had been hoping for a little bit more, like the diagshow at the end of fallout saying you what happens afterward. It does not happen. Nonetheless the ending were satisfying enough for me, just lacking a tad bit. Big big big bad things : the screen at the end telling you to wait for DLC. They could have sparred that, or made it more discreet, as if the main menu ""downloadable content checking"" was not enough. That blue screen with DLC at the end was .... Over the top. Multiplayer is OK, consist in you and 4 trying to fight off waves, with XP reward and a store to buy items. but is problematic due to 2 things : they tied part of the game (effective military rating force) to the multiplayer. Now some people are playing it so finding coop player is easy. But what in 2 month ? What in 6 month ? If you find nobody you WILL be stuck at 50% rating, thus making it harder for you to get certain ending. This is definitively a BAD BAD BAD decision. Overall, I enjoyed Mass Effect 3 very much, but I think it has been clearly bracked by financial decision, and attempting to cash in, by having day 0 DLC (a clever marketing and salesman would have made it a week 1 or week 2 DLC) the shop/multiplayer influence on single player and the problem described as above, and the endings, which looks actually as if they had to make them on the quick due to financial reason. All in all, the lasting appeal of this game is IMHO lower than for ME1 and ME2 and the console influence has make it much more evident the lowering of the RPG element in favor of FPS element. I would still recommend it to anybody having played ME1 and 2 , but as a stand alone I cannot recommend it too much. Final verdict : 7. Would be a 8 if not for multiplayer undue influence on single player Military rating, and would be a 9 if only they had added , even a few still picture telling us what happens afterward as in fallout or other game did. This is after all the END of the trilogy.",7,2012-03-26,PC,user

kofelovr,"I originally gave this game a 6, but I'm reducing that to a 1 because of all the BS public relations rhetoric BiowarEA is putting out there to defend that travesty of an ending instead of acknowledging it was flawed. Falling back on the old ""artistic vision"" crap just isn't going to quell the outrage of an, arguably, good percentage of the people who have finished playing the game. ""Artistic vision"", my a$$. People had those kind of visions back in the 60's when they: ""Turned on, tuned in, and dropped out"". That coupled with the ""we'll have more information for you in April"" crap which is a painfully obvious stall tactic to not tank sales even more -- it couldn't be more transparent and it's insulting to the player's intelligence. It's dismissive in tone and nature. Way to go -- alienate even more of your core fan base.",1,2012-03-25,PC,user
Lew,"The introduction to the game was poorly done and pointless. The first act was somewhat fun but eventually I was just grind thru missions to accumulate items that in the end where meaningless. The next act was more of the same. And finally the end was a huge disappointment nothing in the rest of the series or in the game really impact how it ends. The game play was OK but I did not enjoy the addition of hand to hand combat. Also, I missed the heavy weapons of ME2. The character development was also pointless. I never felt like anything I gave my character was really important. So mostly the game was unfun and pointless. A terrible way to end 2 previously good games.",4,2012-03-25,PC,user
Hurzt,"Looking back, I enjoyed playing Mass Effect 2 the most; to me the story, gameplay and atmosphere rocked big time, giving me a cineastic experience and a feeling of immersion only few games have given me so far. Although ME2 was mostly linear, the sheer variety of satisfying setpieces and well-done scripts/dialogues made ""collecting"" character for character (your team/allies) and the over-arcing story much fun. I went to every location and even scanned most of the planets for resources, although it was quite tedious. After a few hours in Mass Effect 3 and some satisfying hours in the multiplayer mode (never played 'Gears') I began to realize there was ""something missing"". And then I started to feel like ""please let me just get through this and don't annoy me too much"". Kudos to Bioware for creating a great SF-lore/galaxy with many great characters, but in ME3, the whole recipe felt sooo ""been there, done that"". I went to earth (in order to finish the game) as soon as I could. There were some great moments and some sparks flying on the way to the ending, too, but most of them had to do with already well established characters. ""On the way to the ending"" kind of expresses it, too. It should feel like ""the end is closing in, but I don't want it to end!"". All in all, I enjoyed this game but can only repeat there's ""something missing"". It could have been so much more... Oh, and all the military stuff with Hackett, war map, soldier talk etc.? Boooooooring -.- Of course it's also difficult so begin a story with an invasion which seems to erase a whole planet's population within hours, just to then start flying through a whole galaxy for weeks(?) in order to be able to ""fight back""...",6,2012-03-25,PC,user

Sperkowitz,"I honestly cannot understand the huge dissatisfaction with the game here. Sure, it's not perfect nor groundbreaking, but nowhere deserving of of a zero or even a 1. However, it may be due to the fact that I am not a hardcore fan of the series so plot holes and other abnormalities are missed by me. I believe there is a lot of passion for the franchise that when it doesn't go in a particular way it is completely dismissed. It is suppose to be the last installment of the series, and it seems many were expecting more. I know I was expecting a better and more grand ending, but I wasn't going to let it completely destroy the other experiences I had. (And, I almost forgot, there was a lot of controversy on the first-day release of DLC. That move by EA caused a lot of anger and probably another reason for the very low scores.) The one flaw I felt with this game is that I felt like I wasn't playing anything new. Just a continuation of the last game. The graphics and the game play felt exactly the same. The only difference is the story is continuing. That being said, I still enjoyed the story and what was going on in the Mass Effect universe. That in itself made the game difficult to put down, and it was the only game I played for the week I purchased it. To easily summarize: if you've played the first and second game, you will know what to expect with the third installment, with the exception of the boring exploring or scanning on the planets.",7,2012-03-25,PC,user

sethman75,"Terrible end to what should have been the best franchise in the past 10 years and it has nothing to do with the ending. Below are my reasons why it is such a poor game. - Single player RPG game forcing players into a multiplayer GoW style game. The worst thing about BW being taken over by EA is that EA are forcing multiplayer into every game which takes away vital resources from the SP portion of the experience which in ME was it's heart and soul. - Terrible 5 year old graphics, with little customisation and horrible anti-aliasing/textures - Story was laughable, such a shame they killed off some of the most interesting chars in gaming - Day 1 DLC which takes players for fools and also takes away one of the best lore/chars in the game - Clunky and very stiff animations which look like they are 6 months of polish away from finished. - Side quests are frustrating as they tell you a random planet you have to find but what they don't tell is that the cluster doesn't even show up on your map until a later pre-requisite has been done. Bad design. - VERY poor quest tracking and info updates. You get so many quests to do at once but if you finish the goal, you have to remember where you got it from and who gave it to you. This is not 1993 BW?!? - Ridiculous mechanic with scanning the solar systems and reaper awareness which discourages players from exploring which was one of ME best qualities in the last 2 games. - Forced gayness. I'm all for choice in game but to have so many gay chars throwing in your face about this or that becomes tiresome VERY quickly and makes you start to think that BW had an agenda. - FOV for the combat is far too close. ME has never been a GoW/COD clone. It has always been more tactical which goes against the decision to be so close as you never feel in control of the situation. - Small thing but the needed the option to remove your helmet. Some of the best helmet's look horrible and you can't take them off as you need the stats. Destroys immersion and connection with the player. - I am disturbed on how critically acclaimed this game is by the so called experts. It really goes to show how little their opinion really means and what an ass-kissing industry video games really is.",2,2012-03-24,PC,user

I think that many people were expecting ~30 different ending cutscenes corresponding to choices you made throughout the series.

ProNada,"THE BEST OF THE SERIES! I'm 90% completed with the game, and didn't want to play through the ending before writing my review. Reason being, I don't want to change the overall game score (which is damn near perfect) based on what happens with the end of the story line. Basically... this game balances the best of the first two and adds a ton of choices on top to change the way the game plays out. Each decision weighs heavily on the outcome... not merely for kicks, it actually affects your ability to fight the reapers! I am playing through as an Adept and have played the same class since ME1... the new abilities are tweaked perfectly and with armor customization, I'm able to achieve the exact build type I wanted (pure Biotic). The game makes it easy to jump in with no backstory at all, if someone wanted to start playing the series in this last adventure, however it's recommended that you at least play through ME2 so you have an understanding as to what major events pre-curse the scene you're entering. I do have a Gripe though.. the cover system isn't perfect by any stretch. I've gotten caught between covering between two objects involunteerily... just trying to come out of cover on one and jumping right behind the next. The aiming is tightened, the battles themselves are very exciting, and many times it forces you to be strategic on your placement of the squad to avoid flanking. It's impossible to play this game and not have fun in the combat. Of course the story line is amazing... the characters and dialogue continue to be the heart of this game, whether it be Joker falling for EDI (the artificial intelligence that takes on a hot robot form), or Anderson talking about how hard the reapers are hitting Earth... it all blends together so well and becomes immersive! Amazing game. Don't hesitate buying it based on these user reviews complaining about the ending... BAH, you'll miss out on an amazing experience. Two thumbs up!",10,2012-03-24,PC,user
exliontamer,"Setting aside the ending (which has been covered to death), there are too many flaws in this game to give it anything higher than a 6. The journal, for example, which defaults to the middle or bottom every time you open it, rather than the latest quest you've received; the dozens of ""find my long lost doohicky on some random planet"" quests which amount to simply scanning a planet to resolve; and ultimately the fact that most of your efforts to save the galaxy boil down to adding 50 points to some vague number which you're trying to get as high as possible before the final battle. And this arbitrary number results in minor little changes to the cutscene you watch at the end -- and none of it really matters. It feels incredibly empty -- wow, sure glad I saved that guy back in ME1 so I could end up with a higher Military Readiness number at the end of ME3 so I could... um what exactly did it change? Oh yeah, Big Ben didn't get vaporized in the cutscene at the end! Yay! That and the fact that every decision you made didn't really matter: let the big bug queen live in ME1? Great! She's back and happy to help you! Killed her? Great! A cyborg version of her is back and happy to help you (or not... but does it really matter?). None of this would matter all that much if Bioware promoted ME3 as Gears of War in Space, but they piled on the hype about every one of your decisions meaning something BIG, about all your questions being answered in the end, etc.",5,2012-03-24,PC,user

Sir_Recon,"Played several times ME1 and ME2, to get a varied experience and it worked in those games, even if I knew how the game played out, ME3 not so much, Game play is very familiar and improved with the combat rolls and powerful imported characters(you get EXP bonuses for imported characters, a nice reward), conversations seem less trite and can be very humorous or candid, but the characters themselves seemed boring even my old friends seemed boring this time. The pacing is good, but the Citidel ""Go Fetch"" sidequests are really silly, but you want to do them for money and EXP of course but they aren't fun, and for some reason you can miss the conversation completely as there is no cursor it appears in your Journal after you ran by that person, quirky, Story progress under the Reaper darkness gathering forces for the end, Normandy is completely overhauled in Alliance spartan them, gone is the bright clean Cerberus Normandy, although its the same ship. Sound is incredible, Gameplay very good, Story Above Average, Graphics on PC nice but need more settings, Input controls, you know the PC has more than 5 buttons right? apparently BIOWARE forgot, no vehicles to drive around, was hoping to get a MAKO, not that hovercraft tho, DAY 1 DLC for an important story crewmember, not cool at all, RPG elements like building your powers, weapons and armor are very good and I like how the loadout affects your power charging times, but still can't equip other members or your squad how you like, they still specialize in two weapons.

Panjandrum,"Despite the final ten to fifteen minutes being something of a mess, this is an excellent, engaging game that manages to live up to the high standards set by the previous two entries in the Mass Effect series. Steven Spielberg famously stated that he would consider games as art ""when somebody confesses that they cried at Level 17,"" which is something that Mass Effect 3 certainly achieves. I know that I cannot be the only player to shed a tear on Tuchanka, or at a particular scene in a Citadel hospital. For that matter, I cannot be the only one to have laughed like a madman during many of the private talks with squadmates on board the Normandy. The reason for such emotional engagement shows how this game lives up to its predecessors - the interesting and well-explored characters at Shepard's side have always been a strength in the Mass Effect series, and number 3 does not disappoint on that front. On top of that, the settings are pretty, gameplay is varied and interesting (who needs cover based shooting when you can rain down biotic destruction on your enemies' heads?) and many of the set pieces are nothing short of breathtaking. In summary then, this game leads you on an adventure across the galaxy, gives you a range of interesting characters and really shows that your decisions matter in shaping the future of life, the universe and everything for 39 hours and 45 minutes, before going what is technically referred to as ""balls-out crazy"" in the final quarter of an hour.

Feldane,"I want to state I personally started a metacritic account to rate this game. The game is not unplayable it just has some horrible flaws that ruin it as a whole. The good is as follows : The story it quite good, the voice acting is great ,it is a very emotional story, it really **** you in and there is a lot more rpg elements(such as modifiable powers and weapons). The bad and it is really bad is as follows: The whole premise of the Mass Effect series is that chose matter, this is totally taken away from you in the ending(s). Even if you made the best chose in every three games import your character over all three, it doesn't matter. The thing that makes it incredibly frustrating is that you lose many character over the course of the games and you make friends and even lovers, and to be given an ending where in that all that sacrifice, all that character development means nothing, especially over the course of three game, is simply not acceptable. The ending honestly ruined the entire gaming experience for me. Other things that bad is decision you made in Mass Effect 2 dlc's & Mass Effect 1 general story are invalidated. Examples, You kill Wrex in ME1, he is back in ME3, you rekindled your relationship with Liara in ME2 Shadow broker dlc, she acts like she has seen you but for the brief time in ME3, You made Anderson a Counselor in ME1, Udena is the Counselor in ME3. A lot of fan favorites are also not playable character in ME3. Wrex is not playable, All of the added cast in ME2 are not playable, though they do make appearances, it is honestly really sad to see them take a back seat in ME3. There is also the day one on disc dlc, which I personally got the N7 special edition of ME3 so i got it for ""free"", it is actually quite vital to the story and should have been free in all additions. In conclusion i tried really hard to like this game. I loved it for the most part, but literally the last 10 minutes of the game ruin it. I know Bioware was aiming for a bitter sweet/deeper meaning ending. It honestly feels poorly executed at best and at worst a big slap in the face to the customer base that made this game so successful. I would not recommend this game to anyone. If you insist on playing it stop after you have your big chat with all your crew and friends, before the final battle, because the ending will ruin it for you. Just tell yourself you won and everyone lives happily ever after, because even the ""best"" ending is a sad one. So yourself a favor and pass on Mass Effect 3.",1,2012-03-23,PC,user
wombatman10,Good combat and fresh characters are sadly ruined by the lack of meaning for long term fans. Major decisions from the first two games are made so meaningless they are expressed with single dialogues and some (rachni and Councillor) are completely ignored and explained with an unsatisfactory explanation. Possibly a good standalone game but fans of the Mass Effect series can only be left feeling disappointed and wanting more.,6,2012-03-23,PC,user
cwmpro,"I was really excited to play this installment of the mass effect series, the idea that the choices and decisions a player can make will create a unique story-line is a great one. That said Bioware has done the unthinkable and ruined what was a great series, one that in my opinion could have gone down as one of the best known generational games. The graphics are sloppy and areas are just covered with shadows, choices from previous games are meaningless, what a waste of time to go and play mass effect 1 and 2 to import a cool custom character, what happened, well none of the choices effect anything in the end. Characters that may have been killed are brought back, no dialog circle half the time, and don't even get me started on the ending which should have been highly developed and unique based on character decisions made throughout the series. Instead we get an ending that is 95% the same in/on every choice with 5% slight but insignificant modifications to represent crucial decisions. Another aspect that the developers messed up on was the blatantly obvious plot holes in the game left in the ending.Furthermore on PC at least this game is incredibly buggy. Glitches occur and you have to reload your game because your character will get stuck on/in a wall. It is sickening that a game you pay 60$ for is not smoothed out, properly tested and not properly developed with regards to the story-line. My overall recommendation of this game is that you should not buy it because it is a waste of money, just look up the plot online or rent it as a last resort; this game has been nothing but wasted opportunity and disappointment both to me and many other mass effect fans out there. It is also nice to know that the critics for this game either didn't know what happened in previous games, did not know the intent and founding principles mass effect was built on or just didn't finish that game before rating it. While the critic rating is one of the most high games out there, I feel along with others that have posted that the games leaves a heck of a lot to be desired. If I had the option to return this game I would. It was incredibly ridiculousness that one the day 1 release that there was DLC content available as well, and it doesn't matter what EA or Bioware says the content is highly relevant to the story-line and would change game play if not purchased. In conclusion this games don't not have a good plot, has poor writing, poorly developed game play and graphics, is full of glitches, has day one DLC and one of the worst endings of all time. For a dedicated fan it is equivalent to being spat on. As a loyal mass effect fan I will always love the idea of what could have been my favorite game series of all time. I am not happy with Bioware or EA for ruining this idea and because of my unhappiness they will not be reviving anymore money from me for further purchases. Beware of this game and do not buy it.",0,2012-03-23,PC,user
Brodesmus,"This game is excellent...until the last 15 minutes or so. The ending (there is only one with different colors) destroyed one of my favorite video game franchises.

CiaranPM,"Frankly, I don't see why everybody is giving this game 0 ratings because of the ending. Yes, I agree, it was odd, and I didn't really like it, but the ending shouldn't determine the game or the series. Every aspect of this game is remarkably well done - the characters are believable, the voice acting is good, the sound effects are good, the graphics are good, the combat flows very well. The only downside with this game is the exploration. It was overdone in Mass Effect 1, but in Mass Effect 2, visiting three major cities made the game feel more expansive. While Mass Effect 3 is substantial, only being able to visit one major city made the non-combat aspect of the game feel somewhat small. This, of course, is only a personal preference. All in all, aside from the odd ending (which Bioware claims to be fixing), Mass Effect 3 is a very solid game.",9,2012-03-23,PC,user

PosMatic,"Let's start by saying that Mass Effect is an amazing franchise! A game that TRULY let you feel that you are a part of it. that you decide who and what you will be. And here it is, the so-called the ""end"" of it... I've finished every game in the series more then 5 times , making sure that every decision stands to my needs and was hoping that normally, the third part of this amazing game will give me peace as a TRUE dedicated ME played, a closure no matter what will happen - And now, That i've finished the game, i feel nausea. i stared at the screen for 5 minutes, while the credits were rolling, and i kept asking myself ""But why? why to end like that?"" Well, just look at all this hatred for the third game... It is not just a coincidence that so many people hate it. And don't even look at the critics, i personally could smell the BS even before i bought the game. Beside the ending, the game offers a lot. The fighting in game are really fun, dodging attacks by jumping from side to side, forward and backwards, adjusting your weapon by adding 2 attachments to it that will have a certain effect. improving the weapon itself in a certain terminal in the ship. Character improvements that reminds me of ME 1. Cut scenes and plot development are REALLY good during the game. Lots of emotions that touched me. really. I find the side missions pretty fun, they are not that complicated - ""Search this planet, look at this planet. check this planet"", But still, i this that BioWare could do better. The weapons and the gear in game had lots of improvements! You have a lot of armors to chose so you can make adjustments just to fill your needs, and so do weapons. And all this REALLY fun, i am not going to ""Kill"" a game because its last 10 minutes BUT, you prepare ~30 hours, making the right adjustments, the right gear, decisions that you feel whole with them, and then, nothing. That is right, nothing. You need to understand that i am not some FanBoy that hate right away because a little thing in-game did not satisfy me, i try to be mature and make a sence out of things, but this is not case in the ending of Mass Effect 3. From one side, though, i can understand WHY to make this ending, But from other side, i feel nausea. Betrayed. Even though i understand and try to accept.",6,2012-03-23,PC,user
mas223,"I just finished Mass Effect 3 tonight. I have no idea what all the drama is about. I thought the endings were fine. What i did have a massive problem with thought was the lack of character subplots for your crew. Sort of made the typical experience just a bit more shallow. I also cannot and will not forgive Bioware for including FAFFING NINJA'S in Mass Effect. I like Ninjas just as much as everyone else. But not in mass effect. Oh and theres too many sexual innuendos in the opening parts of the game, that dont really fit into the story, to make it totally clear bioware are pandering to gay people. There is so much gayness until the middle of the game. Still. they did manage to improve on the graphics, sound and surprisingly gameplay. The closing experience also left a positive note, so an 8. Ps. I'm not fan of bioware (quite dislike them at the moment actually) or mass effect, just wanted to see the close the trilogy, so my expectations could have been lower than many people here.

DaneMetchnikov,"Simply the one best sci-fi games I've ever played (I can only think of HL2 as better one), I must give it a 10. Great, emotionally involving conclusion, with lots of heroic moments. The interactions/relationships between the main characters are even better than those designed for the previous game (including the same sex romance option, which I think adds even more realism to the universe created here). The combat system was simply great: fast, easy to use, effective. The graphics were amazing, from the scenarios to the facial expressions. The moral options really forced me to think carefully what I was doing and most of them were in a grey area that was difficult to sort out. I cannot believe how many people are giving this amazing game a 0, just because they didn't like one aspect of it (even if it's the story's conclusion); especially considering they claim to be huge fans of ME1 and ME2. How can they not see that ME3 is better than its predecessors almost in every aspect (RPG, combat system, graphics, relationships, moral options, action).

Soulgraph,"With better combat (fighting Cerberus), some animation & overall graphic improvements over the 1st two games and writing that seemed to salvage the plot from ME2s' I honestly thought this was going to be an end worthy of my love for the franchise. Sadly it seems more like the dev team ran flat out of good ideas or time about 3/4 of the way through. While the artwork, effects and general aesthetics were better than the first two games, it looked as if the same textures were used from console versions of Mass Effect 3. The multi-player should not have even made it in to the game & the day one DLC (which I did purchase) felt like a ten dollar soak.

butternut86,"Bioware should be ashamed of themselves. This ending was inexcusable. The Deus ex machina explanation for the Reapers and how the Catalyst justified their desruction as a way to save organic's from their own tendencies of destroying themselves was nothing short of ridiculous. Its circular writing, logic and reasoning wrapped into one. Let me be clear. 99% of this game is an absolute masterpiece. But the end was so god awful that it actually undermined the brilliance of the entire series. Two things pissed me off in Mass Effect 3, the non-existant closure of the ending, and non-reveal of Tali's face (there was a photo.. but come on) . Both are inexcusable, and the ending is pathetic. Personally, Bioware, and its Reaper puppeteer should give its consumers FREE ENDING DLC to try and redeem themselves. I already paid around $200 for all three Mass Effect games including numerous dlc packages. Bioware and EA owe their consumers a decent ending with some closure to the characters, planets and races I've come into contact these past 5 years. Bioware should ashamed.

Jobles,"The beginning starts with that which you have been fighting to keep away from your world, the Reapers have come to Earth. Shepard has been grounded and stripped of his status because of what he did during the event of Arrival (ME2 DLC) The combat system has been improved slightly, making it easier to go from cover to cover, as well as easier running, unlike ME2, where running was near impossible if you're avoiding something or trying to run around corners. ME 3 allows faster, unlimited running, and you can run around corners easily, which helps if you're trying to run to much better cover. The weapons are customizable this time, as well as there being more weapons, not as many as ME1, but you receive plenty to choose from, especially if you're a PC user. The modifications are back as well, but these are limited compared to its ME1 predecessors. Story is just as good as it was before. There's certain points where, if you've played the games in succession, you will cry. On a bad note, there's some things that are not good. While throughout the game you gather Alliance strength for the final battle, it seems like gathering a lot doesn't matter. As you're fighting, you don't see the Rachni Queen's people on the ground (if you saved her). You don't see Turians, Asari, Batarians, Krogan(if you saved Wrex in the first game, and helped Wrex and the Turians become allies this game). Which is a huge let-down. I wanted to see everyone on the line with me. I wanted to go through the battles, and see these people, and creatures, fighting with me while we assaulted the ground units of the Reapers. Another bad thing is the day one DLC. Paying 10 dollars for the content locked on disc. It's a horrible business practice which companies need to STOP. The character is worth it, though, because unlike Kasumi and Zaeed, the DLC character has a story. He's interactive inside and outside the ship. You talk to him, you have choices. Your shipmates talk to him, NPCs on the Citadel talk to him at one point. If those two are worth 5 bucks, and you don't even interact with them aside from they spout something, without a conversation wheel popping up to interact with them. The DLC character for 3, has all that, and he's a great fighter. All in all, this game was great. It was almost perfect, however I do understand why people are giving this game a terrible rating. The ending(s) are why. However, almost every question is answered thanks to what is fan-researched: The Indoctrination Theory. When you finish this game, if you have questions still, go to YouTube, look up the 22 minute video Mass Effect 3 - Shepard's Indoctrination by ACAVYOS. This will explain SO MUCH. It ties into the endings easily, and it helps explain them as well. Again, this is a great game, and well worth every cent.",9,2012-03-22,PC,user

textor44,"I've been playing Mass Effect since the first game came out. Before even playing Mass Effect 3, I went through the trouble of replaying the first and second game just so that I could remind myself of the story in full, as well as ensure that all the choices I wanted to have imported were made properly by the character I was bringing into the game. So, did I enjoy Mass Effect 3? Yes. The game had decent writing (with an exception that I will elaborate on later in the review) and the tone of urgency was present throughout the entire game. The voice acting was superb, as usual, and there were even some moments that had me laughing hysterically, and other parts that caused me to really feel a sadness as events occurred involving characters I had grown quite fond of. Multiplayer was added into the game this time around, and I'm not sure I really agree with that decision. Mass Effect was always a single-player experience, and the multiplayer seems almost as if it was simply a way for EA to make more money, as you would have to purchase new equipment packs from them with a ""Customizable Card Game"" expansion feel to it-- a bunch of ""common"" items in the pack, with a chance for some rare ones. Playing with other players is a bit fun, however, but with the matching system giving me matches where I'm fighting along side level 18 characters, and dying horribly, it can get old rather fast. In addition, making this a ""requirement"" to increase your galactic readiness rating is also very annoying, as you have to invest a massive amount of effort to increase and maintain the rating. Alternatively, you can get the games they released for the iOS platform to assist in this, but without having the android versions available on the day of release, it gives an advantage to those who can afford Apple's products to play the games with their equipment. Finally, we come to the ending. This is the exact reason why the game did not get a higher rating from me, other than my issues with the multiplayer and ""galaxy at war"" systems: The ending was an insult. As long as you bothered to invest the time into getting the numbers for the war as high as you can, you will have three options, of which I will not go into the details in order to keep spoilers out of the review, instead referring to them by colors, since those who have played the game will know what I refer to without revealing anything. The blue ending, to me, stood against what my character fought for in the three games, so I didn't feel that would work properly. The red ending would have destroyed some of the things that I had worked very long and hard to achieve, starting all the way back in the second game, and also violating the principles that my character had fought long and hard to achieve. This left the green ending for me, which was, essentially, the least of three evils for me. After my choice, I had looked up the other two endings, to see what they were like... and I was appalled. Essentially the same footage was used for each one, with just the colors I mentioned being more prominent in each, and which characters you see changing a bit. To me, this was the height of laziness and an insult to myself. When I looked up the other options, I expected to see vastly divergent videos, instead of ""choose which color you like best."" In addition NONE of the three endings really showed an epilogue of what happened. Ok, you saved the galaxy! Now what? We won't tell you! So, was the game worth playing? I'd say yes. The gameplay itself was enjoyable, and with a few exceptions, it was a satisfying experience overall. They did wrap up the storyline of several characters, and answered a few questions that had been lingering, and at one point even gave a very satisfying historical lesson on the Morning War (the first war between the robotic Geth race and their creators, the Quarians), and the results of some of your earliest choices in the first game do come back to have some nice effects. In addition, they also took a subtle approach to addressing some complaints caused by bugs in Mass Effect 2 (your super-fan referencing an import bug preventing him from responding properly to what you did in the first game, for instance). Bioware has released a statement saying they would take the fan backlash on the endings seriously, and attempt to address them. If they do this, and create a new ending that allows players that were fans of the game since the beginning to feel as if their choices really mattered in the end, then I believe that Mass Effect 3 has the potential to be the best in the series. If these concerns are not addressed, however, Bioware's historically positive list of games will forever have a dissatisfying footnote next to what should have been the pinnacle of one of their most ambitious properties.",7,2012-03-21,PC,user

IronGuy410,"It's embarrassing that so many people just looking for something to hate in a game this good are willing to go on websites and give 0 scores just because the games ending isn't the one they specifically would have wanted. The truth is, while the game is somewhat streamlined even when compared to the last one, the combat is just right, the graphics are actually quite jaw-dropping, the story throughout the entire game is thrilling, extremely emotional and more epic than ever before, the voice acting is as great as the previous games, the co-op is surprisingly good and ties in well with the story, the whole game itself is 30 hours long and very replayable and the ending, which is where most of the hate seems to be directed , in my opinion does a great job of closing this incredible sci-fi trilogy.",9,2012-03-21,PC,user
Robbie1982,"I gave this game 10/10 on the Xbox review, and reading some comments. The galactic readiness meter needs to be patched. I have realised it is pointless. U work really hard to get everyone into the fight, making important decisions and completing sidequests. And the readiness meter stays at 50% !! Till u go kill some stuff in multiplayer, where u can conviiently spend lots of Bioware (EA Points) on weapons packs. That is a huge fault with this game. That can be patched tomorrow in a flash (although I ran into a few bugs so maybe that is this ?)Despite this, and my last mission having a depressing casualty count. I Would still score this game 8. The more I think about it - what a huge flaw. But it is so incredibly easy to patch. Just make it possible to get single player readiness to 90% and politely tell us when that is reached to go play some multiplayer.",10,2012-03-21,PC,user
johnson5,"I rarely review anything, I prefer to enjoy things myself (after paying such a large amount of money, for my income). But Mass Effect 3, just destroyed many things I was proud of about the whole series. First of all, beware of buying the game because of Origin. A blunt attempt to battle Valve, a bad one at that. Secondly, connecting the multiplayer portion of the game to your personal single-player experience and directly influencing your final score (thus the endings you can get), is just an awful way to promote the multiplayer part. And it's not even a small addition to the score... That doesn't mean much though, because as thousands have said before me, the ending is just despicable. Plot holes, no personal influence, not making much sense, seriously rushed and totally disappointing to anyone who has actually connected with the game. People are actually thinking of alternative theories, just to fool themselves that the ending was logical. This really feels like Dragon Age 2 (which had 5 dungeons in total and they were recycled in every way), Bioware having disappointed once again.",0,2012-03-21,PC,user
Lacsapix,A great game with an amazing story. The feeling you get when you interact with these huge decisions is unlike anything I've experienced in a game. The reason this game isn't earning a 10 is the ending but that subject has been discussed by many other reviewers. The ending is just a dent in a sphere with a very solid core underneath.,9,2012-03-21,PC,user
LEGION3000,"What happened to Bioware? Where did you go wrong? The once proud creators of 3 of the best RPGs in all of gaming (KOTOR, ME1, DA:O) have become the peddlers of mindless garbage like Mass Effect 3 and DA2. The whole idea of Mass Effect was the 'EFFECT' part. Your actions are supposed to effect the outcome of the game, and the series. This game literally takes every decision you have made in the previous games, laughs at them and then flushes them down the toilet. Sometimes just strait up telling you, ""no you didn't choose to kill that guy last time because we feel he is important to the story we are trying to cram down your gullet! But you can choose which one of your companions you want to boink, even the gay one! LOOK HOW EDGY AND COOL WE ARE!"" This game is an insult and a travesty to anyone that played the games before. At least Bioware had the decency to change main characters before ruining Dragon Age. The graphics look good some of the time, and the song in the purgatory club has a good Daft Punk beat. Otherwise play Mass Effect 1 and 2 again and just imagine the end of ME2 is the ending of the series, you will be far far happier than the choose your death ending of ME3",1,2012-03-21,PC,user
devil_92,"i will simply say that it is an awesome game,Bioware listend to the feedback from mass effect 2 and highly improved the general gameplay,and added many customisation options that was lacking in mass effect 2 there is just 1 negative thing i can say about mass effect 3 and that is the bad ending,other then that it was great,multiplayer great,series great, totally worth the money i put down on the digital deluxe edition :)",9,2012-03-21,PC,user
Redwing2b,"I will not deny the fact that the game is a great game and so is the series, but with one major issue. I don't remember any of all the great moments of the series or the 3rd game. Why? All I remember is the last 20 minutes and the ending and how I was left feeling like something was seriously wrong. I wont spoil it, but the choices we all made shaping our characters all boil down to just three possible ending choices. Each choice is literally identical to each other save for the color. I mean literally the only difference is the color. For those who have not played yet you will see exactly what I mean when you get there and see the ending. Save for a few very slight differences. I will not say that the endings are totally bad, but that only works if the theories running around out there end up being true. The plot holes are too many to just be written off as this is the ending deal with it. Things do not make any sense, and we the players are left feeling totally put out by the series we love so much. All the choices, all the customization, all the freedom we had through the entire series are all thrown away in the ending. What we are left with is a hollow shell of what the Mass Effect series really has been. The signs are there that something is wrong with the ending. The tone, the feel, the way it pushes the player into literally a corner and says here make a choice that ultimately doesn't take into account all the choices and hard work you did over the course of three games. I was left searching for clues, much like everyone else, I was talking, searching, and sharing my thoughts on the game and the ending. So I must give props to Bioware and EA, if you wanted us all talking about the ending and the game long after it was over, you did it, but not in a positive way I'm sad to say. Sure the reviews on Metacritic can be flooded with BS bad reviews, but the real reviews I think are easy to spot. I loved the Mass Effect series and I recommend people play the 3rd game, its amazing and really makes the player feel part of the entire situation. It's just lost right at the end and it makes me sad to say that honestly. I rated it a 7 because the ending took so much away from the experience it literally made me upset. All the fun, all the deep enriching choices, all the torment over making hard choices, it all was leading to a final battle that ultimately was a let down, with little to no closure. I wanted to see the forces I worked to bring into the fight actually kicking some butt. I wanted to see the entire race of beings come in and unleash fury on the reapers, but I say none of that, instead I get a great space building to a battle that just sorta fades away. The ending for me was not bad per say but it clearly was wrong in how it feels. Something is missing, something is wrong, something more is coming. This can't be the end, it just feels so terribly wrong. When I look back on the experience I say it was worth it, but I struggle now to remember all the great and tough moments all because the ending clouds it all up. Makes me sad, and I pray that I am right in that there is something more the developers intended that is coming, I pray.",7,2012-03-21,PC,user

On my way to the end i had 2 game stoping bugs, one with the dlc that wouldnt let me watch videos and another one with the main game that required a reboot.

Bugging cut-scenes were heads are turned to the side when having conversations and sometimes just see a wall. Allot of the voice-sounds are gone, use subtitles! Wrong textures., supposed to come on different act. Sometimes strange conversations, were you dont know what they are talking about, like you talking with a different guy. These little mistakes destroys the total experience. Going from ME1 and ME2 to this is a scandal! Seems like Bioware are tired of Mass Effect and now so am I.

WHITECJ2OW,"I would like to start my review by asking you, as a review reader, what makes a story GOOD. Well first lets look at some ""good"" stories......pick any 10, any 10 will do. Now look for a common theme, a common element that they all contain that plays an integral part in it's enjoyment and goodness. The ending. For a story to be good, the ending has to be good, and if you are wondering yes cliffhangers can and are good for the most part when necessary. Now with that in mind, let me just sum it up: Mass Effect 3 Does not have a good ending. Notice how i did not type ending as a plural because to be completely honest all the endings are the same. They truly are. Without going into much detail I recommend you keep this in mind because other than the ending this game is 9/10, or 10/10 on a good day no doubt. But the atrocity of the ending just overshadows and takes away the replay-ability of the game and as such I do feel a 1 is truly needed for this review to be effective.",1,2012-03-20,PC,user

asbo604,"OK, ill try to write this as an impartial gamer who loved the ME series and view this as a stand alone game. ****SPOLIERS**** The game is good. Its not amazing but its damn good. I liked the improved customisation with weapons I liked the increase in typed of weapons etc. I liked the story (excluding the end) some of the characters who I had grown to care for and love had some amazing, emotional endings. I can live with the sacrifice theme running through the game and it suits the story. I dont really care about graphics if the story and gameplay is good so Im not gonna bother here. Problems I had with the game are I missed having 1 or 2 of the previous characters from ME2 on my team. But they featured in the game so I can live with that. I didnt really like JAMES or what ever he was called. Didnt get the character, and looking at all the great characters we already had, I think it was a waist to have him take up a slot. Just seemed pointless. I was dissapointed with the whole building up your fleets etc and thought it would be something like DA. Origins where you could choose to deploy them some how or even see them in different combat movies depending on what resources you collected. So this was again a bit of a waist. Finally, the ending. Its all been covered before. I could live with sad ending. Hell I could live with sacrificing Shep. But not in every ending! Not to mention all the other complaints about plot holes, (why was the Normandy running away?) Closure is the best way to describe what I need with this. I have devoured any information regarding the ending I could, but I think people are being too clever and giving too much credit to writers. I just think it was a lazy ending. until the ending this is an 8 or 9 out of 10 game. but the ending can not be ignored. unfortunately Play the game, by all means, you need to.

Gus21,"Let me clarify at this point that I have always been a big sci-fi fan in all forms it comes (I love star trek, Arthur Clarke and Isaac Asimov novels etc) so I became in love with the ME universe since the 10 first gameplay minutes of the first one. I bought the game 3 days after its European release so I was full of user critic terror about it's quality. Now that I have complete it I could say that it really was a descent and fun game to play. Yes, there were bugs. Yes, there are plot holes. Yes, the all multiplayer thing is a mess. Yes, it has lost almost all the RPG elements ME1 used to have. But it was Mass Effect all right. The story and cutscenes are amazing, the gameplay and graphics are great (if you don't like many explosions and surround sound effects in your game you should ask for Steel Magnolias: The **** hardcore-RPG fans may wait in tremor for their beloved upcoming point-and-click action of Diablo 3 but they have no right to call it â",8,2012-03-20,PC,user

One aspect of the game that's really disappointing is the Multiplayer though. Huge letdown. It almost made me cry. We don't need another damn survival game with endless of enemy waves, with no real purpose. It gets real old, real fast. No dedicated servers, no chat system(besides voice), no real goal, stupid random unlocking system. Different enemies, yes, but in the end it makes no different. Different maps, yes, but in the end they're exactly the same in different colors and backgrounds. Where's the co-op missions? cause this can't be it. I really hope it will be added later on.

dmjrnbsn,"One of the most profoundly disappointing endings to any story in any medium. The writers removed the cornerstone in which the entire story was built upon - choice and consequence. So, the entire building comes crashing down at the end. In the end, none of the choices your character makes throughout three games matter. All the relationships you've built are meaningless. There is no closure in the relationships made, whether between LIs or squad mates. They never come to fruition, and there is no resolution. ME3 was advertised to have a multitude of outcomes based upon players' choices. That's what originally made the Mass Effect franchise such a great success. The finale should have raised the player to great heights or taken the player to despair... and everywhere between based upon the consequences of the player's decisions throughout the entirety of the series(Paragon, Renegade, or somewhere in between). BioWare should have finished their remarkable work on the strengths that it was built on. Choice and consequence. It seemed like a given, but... You leave the game feeling complete and utter disappointment. It is truly remarkable how an ending can be so profoundly and remarkably bad. It truly destroys the franchise entirely. This is not an easy thing to say, as I've loved the series from the start. There is no replay value at all. BioWare has ruined years of work in the last ten minutes on what should have been one of the greatest RPGs of all time. It will be a study in the future on how not to end a story franchise.",0,2012-03-20,PC,user

Even the multiplayer gameplay was better than expected. If not for said disappointing ending, ME3 would be the best title in the franchise so far.

Shaksie,"Firstly I must dismiss the cretinous reviews from most of the people that I've seen. Yes this game's dialogue isn't as good as the others but it still vastly surpasses that of other games, RPGs and shooters alike. The day one DLC was also a little annoying but it doesn't diminish the game at all, it makes the content included feel more exclusive thus important. Terrible graphics? What are you talking about, the graphics was vastly overhauled from it's predecessor, Mass Effect 2. The combat element has also been vastly improved to cater for the FPS junkies, don't get me wrong I did not appreciate this but it didn't diminish the RPG element in any way. The choices in Mass Effects 1 and 2 have a very profound impact on this game, I don't know what you people are talking about. Have you even played the game? The only reason this game is not one of the best trilogy climax games is because of the less sophisticated RPG element and dialogue in relation to the first and second, however it is still better than most games'. The multiplayer greatly adds to the feel of the game and with a little bit of work (especially on the connection and playable race/class/gender combinations) it could be extremely enjoyable and have a very positive impact on the game. However I was a little disappointed with the lack of dialogue sophistication and the choices were slightly less prudent than the predecessors, good effort Bioware but please don't diminish the RPG element if you want to increase the combat quality.

luke10123,"I feel compelled to give Mass Effect 3 a quick review trying to avoid repeating what everyone else has already said. i felt I had to say something mainly to counteract the shameless review-bombing the game seems to be getting everywhere, which I feel is undeserved. First, let's consider the game. NOT the ending, but the game. It's technically sound, the graphics are nice, performance is excellent on high settings, the cover-based shooting (while not as good as some pure 3rd person shooters) is better than it's ever been. The missions themselves are a lot of fun and dead interesting, the only exception being the missions on unexplored planets but these are short enough that they don't get annoying. I have to point out, that I have NO IDEA what people are on about with auto-dialogue, honestly not a clue, my conversation wheel was there in all it's 6-sided glory. I also liked how the game remembered all my little decisions dating back to the original ME, it was a really great touch that i would love to see more in games. In almost every way this game is a perfect 10. However, the ending. Yes, it was full of plot holes, but at the end of the day, it was their game, their ending. I learned my lesson from Knights of the Old Republic II: ending are never what you want. I hated the binary ending choices, but not so much that i'm not already replaying the series for another play-through. I didn't enjoy the lack of a proper epilogue, but I knew there would be no happy ending. but here's the funny thing. I didn't like the ending, but it didn't make me angry. I just felt sad. Sad that such an amazing series that I've loved for years was coming to an end. This really is a compelling, beautiful game that, if you've invested in the whole series, will blow you away. Don't listen to the trolls, I beg you, this is a certainty for at least half a dozen GotY awards, no question. Also, one word on the game pegging DLC. THIS IS EA. what did you expect?",9,2012-03-20,PC,user
Wildtigaah,"What a obvious part of trolls here. Bunch of greedy kids that are disappointed. This game is really good and I will explain about my personal opinion of how this game is with positives and negatives. + Nice graphic, including facial expressions and that sort of things. And nice design och the characters as well. + Very good voice actors, nice to have the old ones coming back from mass effect 1 and 2. + Polished at some parts that definitely needed it from the older games (like mass effects combat system). + Fantastic sounds on the guns. Even the music is very good especially at the citadel. The Citadel is bigger and gives you a welcoming feeling every time you enter there. - Sometimes I'm speechless, I don't have the ability to pick my own reaction, but that's not always though. - It didn't felt like it was so many touching side quests, It was like - alright another one, combat, combat... - And the worst **** ever is the map. Can't find for a **** and if you scan for objects It's like ""You found oil"" is that suppose to make me happy or what? No don't use that crap bores the hell out of me. If you never played any Mass Effect game you should ABSOLUTELY not start with this one. You need the whole background, to build up this personal feeling. At least play trough Mass Effect 2.

Quichotte9,"ME3 is what I expected after the ME-ME2 transition -- simplified and less open. As a PC player, I was annoyed at the control changes -- got over it, but not at the environment constraints (exploring the Citadel anyone). Can't over that one. As for the decision paths, well they are more of a railroad in ME3 than ME2 and more so than ME. The big itch for me is the art direction -- the facials are very early 2000s. Ash looks awful. As for the split breast look: let it die. You want to release pseudo-pin-up art, do that and do it well. The manga/anime business have done so for over 30 years. My personal favorite look right now is Miranda. As for the rest of the art direction: too busy, too distracting and thus too useless. It makes for distracting if not frustrating game play. Therefore, my take on this is ""failed"". Still, there are moments -- the Citadel holding dock picture wall. Storyline, well there is again a sense of railroading. Yet, I expected it. This is the closing chapter, and about the end of the adventure and story. A little heavy-handed, but not disappointing. The treatment of the individuals caught in a thunderstorm over which they have little control was expected and fairly mature. Sorry, in war, few come out unscathed. Now did I enjoy the game experience -- yes. Did I get my money's worth -- yes. Could it have been better -- yes. Still, I give it a 7. Good game.",7,2012-03-20,PC,user

Spice,"For a Bioware game, advertised as having varying outcomes depending on your choices, this game does not deliver. If you are expecting a meaningful, epic finale to a trilogy, this is not it. The last 10 minutes of the game feel like a slap in the face, denying any control over the fate of your carefuly crafted character, and making all your choices seem pointless. For this reason, it also kills replayability. If it was not for the ending, I would rate this as a 9. As it stands though, it is very disapointing and not at all what was **** other concern with the game was the questlog, it didn't update and wasn't very clear about locations, making sidequests somewhat confusing.",5,2012-03-20,PC,user

Weapon choices and customization add a great variety, whereas different armour types and moves ensure the player can play exactly as they want to play. The characters are fully evolved and draw great depth, creating what could have been the best game of the year. If I could have stopped a second before the ending, it would have been 10/10. However then there is the ending. This ending respresents something complete unknown to Mass Effect, gives no closure or reasoning, has no basis for being there, and completely and utterly ruins the game. In fact it ruins Mass Effect 1 and 2 as well, as how could anybody restart the series with this kind of appalling disgraceful ending?",0,2012-03-20,PC,user
Scarlet,"The world of Mass Effect finally came to its end. As a commercial way to rip peoples money off. The game is only full of utter disappointment, besides a few drops of light that are far from saving the game. Good job, you tried to improve graphics that were already working, now the clips have bugs and the game is so huge it eats a lot of space from my laptop's hard drive. Combat had already got so boring I lowered the difficulty before I started multiplayer and story. Onto the multiplayer. Such golden promises, a lot of expectation from people and... ta-da! They ""created"" what's been created in numerous games before. Repetetive, dull multiplayer that's seen after you play a single round of it. It has no chat besides voice, and personally as a female gamer I'd hate to talk to strangers, knowing how it has ended up many times. And what about people that aren't really into shooters and come from the RPG side, or without a microphone? The only drive to keep playing it is unlocking new weapons and characters and the playing itself reminds me of a Disney made childrens game that at some point has a shooter mini-game. If I want to play a shooter game with no ""goal"" or purpose, I'd rather pick something like Left for Dead 2 or Bulletstorm, or hell even Call of Duty: MW. With real kick-ass weapons. What the ****, Bioware? I can't romance James Vega? I went to Mass Effect Wiki because I was curious about the romances. For my utter defeat, I found I cannot romance the (in my personal opinion) hottest character in the ME universe so far. I even signed a petition, a petition, to get a DLC for a possible romance. Which would also be the only DLC I'd ever consider buying for the game. Note, consider. I do not dig aliens. I do not dig whimps. Even though, I have to give it to Kaidan, he's manned up. Did I already mention I do not dig aliens? I wish I hadn't picked any romance in the game, but how was I supposed to know it'd just be 1 man, 1 alien and lesbians in the end. In my opinion the lesbians are there to sell the game more anyway. Personally I really don't like it that my assistant in both previous games has been after my character's bum. Besides that, I never finished the game. I played it for a good couple of hours and decided I'm not putting up with having to play multiplayer that murders my brain for a better ending. The story felt like an on-going drag that I just wanted to stop looking at even with my short play time. Much things didn't make any sense. And I was also disappointed I seriously cannot romance Mr.Vega. There's been a lot of complaints that the ending is very bad. I probably won't make it there, seeing that it was difficult to motivate myself to finish ME2 either. I shall be glad. I can very shortly analyze the reasons I would push myself to play it. 1) I could live in hope to beat Illusive Man, 2) Wrex is splendid, 3) James Vega. No expectations, no disappointment. I wasn't expecting the game unlike many people I know, which most likely makes me a lot less disappointed in Bioware and the stupid game. I was more disappointed in Dragon Age 2, which was a joke.",1,2012-03-20,PC,user

Starting with the argument, solid, the story is centered on the important things, Bioware as improved from Mass Effect 1 to 3 adding things, but keeping the original essence of the game. The story has some generic aspecs, but itself triumphs on others: originality, diversity, consistency, and it entertains. The gameplay is just perfect, still not allowing to jump, something necesary in many games, the expereince is just excelent, Bioware really knows how to improve in this aspect whitout creating the sense of change. The game is diferent, but only to improve, it doesn't create troubles for the player. Graphics are not the best in the industry but are efective, they look great, finally the game incorporates Antialiasing!

mdc837,"This was a solid game. It was thoroughly fun for most of the game. I loved the combat gameplay, the customization options with the armor, guns, squad, and RPG skill tree. What i was less than happy with was that so many of the missions that were sidequests were simply to fly your ship to another galaxy and click on a planet and find the spot and click. I would much rather have had the squad actually go onto the planet, have to fight my way to the prize and then obtain it. It would've made the side missions much more fun and extended the re-playability of the game. Another thing is they should have allowed for you to have an option to skip cinematic scenes instead of forcing you to watch certain ones. Overall though this was a very fun game that had the potential to be great with a few tweaks. Bioware did a good job with this one. The ending that everyone is getting upset over is something I do not understand. I had no issue with there being a conclusion to the character and played through all three endings. This was the best shooter/RPG I have played since Borderlands was released and I was pleased with it overall.",8,2012-03-19,PC,user
Xingenue,"FEMSHEP PLAYERS: They got rid of all of the male romance options except for 2. So choose wisely or else you're in for a disappointing play through in the ""romantic"" department. STORY/DIALOG: I enjoyed the story up until the last 10 minutes of the game. The choices / societal ties you've been establishing over the course of 3 games don't amount to anything aside from numbers on your Estimated Military Strength meter. The ""endgame"" scene is terrible and full of retcons (not just small ones, but ones that quite literally destroy the past 3 games). Aside from that, the dialog is still witty and some of the character development improved many characters I didn't really care about in ME2. However, I felt Ashley's dialog was brief for players who didn't romance her. INTERFACE, MECHANICS, ETC: I actually LOVED what they did with the mechanics / gameplay. Powers recharge faster and they integrated a combo system for adepts that can cause biotic explosions and massive AOE. Multiplayer is surprisingly addicting. However, the quest interface is worse than ME2. There are no ""flags"" for side quests anymore. You have to constantly be checking your journal (oh and the codex + journal are now merged together so its even more user-unfriendly). I had to keep a sheet of paper on me while I was playing to keep track of side quests. Despite all the positive things I have written, I'm giving this game a 1 because, at its core, Mass Effect was about the story. Its why Mass Effect 1 was my favorite despite the terrible gameplay mechanics. I have spent money on the DLCs and the collectors editions. It has all amounted to nothing because I didn't get ""an end"" to my story. Their marketing campaign was ""TAKE EARTH BACK"". At no point do you do this in the game.",1,2012-03-19,PC,user

wasawsolos,"**SPOILER ALERT** For the past 5 or so years, I have been a huge mass effect fan. I loved the idea that my choices mattered from game to game. In fact, this game would have gotten a 9.5 from me (not a 10 because I got stuck because **** that caused me to have to restart a mission) but the ending of ME3 is the most plot hole ripping, out of context, jacked up thing I have ever seen in a story. It is like watching the last of a super awesome trilogy movie, that has been hyped to the moon, then the film stops in the last 10 minutes, the screen goes dark, and the theater catches on fire. BioWare has essentially destroyed their entire universe that they have created because without the mass relays staying intact, the stories of mass effect cant happen. They somehow managed to kill their entire franchise within 10 minutes. Up until the last 10 minutes, the game is great. After that 10 minutes though, ME3 goes from great to crap.

paxbanana,"For some reason, Bioware decided to make ME3 a third-person shooter game with pretty cut-scenes. The RP element that made the Mass Effect series so unique was largely missing from the game, along with side-quests. I can't say I understand that, given there's a 'combat-only' game option. And, for pretending to be a shooter, there was actually no ending boss fight. I probably would forgive some of the dialogue shortage if the ending had actually been worth the tediousness of playing through the game. I was insulted by the ending that was played off as ""16 wildly different endings"". Bioware didn't even have the respect for their fans to make ONE different cut-scene and instead recycled the same one for every ending. If they had actually delivered, I probably would have forgiven the fact they dropped the RPG element from the game. As it stands, I can't bring myself to play through the game again. It says something when you'd rather read a book than watch a cut-scene again. In ME1 and 2, at least you could vary the dialogue. 30 hours of mediocre game play (riddled with graphics and sound issues that do not do the excellent VA cast and OST justice) is not worth $80.",3,2012-03-19,PC,user

There is no pay off to this story, no culmination to your personal decisions, no outcome that make sense, and you ultimately wonder if everything you did actually mattered then.

I can't bring my self to start this game again, In fact I can't even think of replaying the whole trilogy as I intended. Animations have some issues, Quest Log is complete mess and some moments are disappointing. But the ""great"" finale ruins absolutely everything I loved about this series.

The end of ME 3 will hit you like a powerful kick to the nards when you realize you that your choices did not matter and the trilogy is ended with more questions then answers.

pitufos38,"SPOILER FREE CRITIC: 1-All your decision in the game produce military points that determine the type of ending you have. But these points affect argumental outcomes that are not related with them. For example (not real, but good for giving you an idea): if you have saved Jon the missile would destroy the reaper. If you didn't save him the missile will fail. That's it, as stupid as it seems. So through the ""trick"" of measuring your decisions in a completely ""out of context"" point scale they have save a lot of story work. Without the story been changed by our decision, the decision lost the meaning, this is only a gears of war with almost no rpg in it. Even the different ending are the same clip with diferent colors. 2-Taking apart the ending the game resemble mass effect 2. Too repetive, although has some good points, but you can forgive that because you are preparing for the big finale. Problem here is that the finale is horrible. However you will enjoy the rest of the game. I encourage to not make sidequest, it is not worht it (the ending will be still horrible) and main quest have a much better quality. 3-The game sucessfully take into account your previous game actions for providing you (or not) help (or trouble) in some missions. That was quite good, at least in my story (I have heard not all are so good). 4-Missions are repetitive, lot of them with very poor argument. Lots seems like a multiplayer match with boots (indeed they seems like multiplayer maps). 5-Too much cloying conversations. In pevious games they were there too but were well introduced. Here they are all around and feels very forced. This is specially true in conversations between male characters. 6-You got the sense there is a love story because is has become a standart of these games. Very forced, underworked. If you are going to put love in your game do it properly with an appeling story, nothing bad happens if you do not put it. 7-DLC day one content. Quite important indeed, unlock protean squad member, that means unlock argumental questions about mass effect lore. Should not be an extra. 8-The protan lore, from the dlc is quite good. like the protean society a lot. 9- **** up. A few closer too mainstream thrid person shooter that previous games and less RPG.

Irraticspasm,"Mass Effect 3 is nothing less then BioWare and EAs betrayal of their fan base for the sake of making money. Any reviews touting this game as a ten are lies! Im pointing my finger at Game Informer and The Escapist, two sites which I frequent. The trilogy once hallmarked an epic story, a story where the players decisions matters, and shape the future of the universe. This has all been sacrificed, cut out of the game leaving nothing but a hollow sixty dollar shell ****, seventy if you bought the DLC, seventy five if you purchased the Collectors Edition. The story and writing are an utter wreck, characters you have come to care about are as hollow and lifeless as the rest of the game. Most of the squad mates you grew to know and love as the first two games unfolded make a cameo appearance, become war assets that do nothing come the end of the story. The day 1 DLC is an overpriced joke containing a character that everyone who has played the first two games will want, but in the end shows to be lifeless and lacking dialog. In the end the DLC is worth it, if you want to spend ten dollars on a powerful Assault Rifle. (Its not worth it!) Dialog is lifeless, far fewer renegade and paragon options appear during dialog replaced with dialog options that are more reminiscent of games from a decade ago. The Normandy is a wreck remodeled and empty, with a skeleton crew that are essentially skeletons. The ambient dialogs and chatter that filled the halls of your ship are no longer there, most rooms have no purpose whatsoever filled with silent characters that do nothing. The few ambient conversations that take place only serve to remind players of the first two games that this is a very different beast ****. Ever mission, every conversation, every decision is a tortured reminder of how good the first two games were compared to the third. The ending which answers no question, fufills no expectations and does not reward you decisions is the final blow to anyone that loved this franchise. Add to that the Gay Romance they have shoehorned into the game. I dont mind homosexuals, I really dont but this character just will not leave me alone. Every time I speak to him it seems I get the opportunity to start a romance with him. I said no on this play through so just stop already, stop asking! Stop trying to make me romance the poor guy BioWare! If you want to make a political statement on gay marriage why shoehorn it into Mass Effect 3? Speaking of that, when did it become legal in Mass Effect 3, and not only that why isnt Ashley furious about it? In the first game shes conservative, xenophobic, she believes in god and BioWare is telling me she wont start a conversation about the gay marriage issue? The multiplayer is tacked on and pointless, with one mode to play to gain system control for single player, system control that does not even matter. Spend your time playing a good online game, like World of Tanks, or Call of Duty, or even Dead Space 2s tacked on multiplayer. As for the ending of the game, I am going to let someone else rage on that, check out this link. ****/2012/03/top-10-reasons-we-hate-mass-effect-3s-ending/ The first two games I played non stop until completion, I enjoyed them, even with Mass Effect 2s dumbed down game mechanics I still enjoyed it and played it numerous times as well as purchasing the DLC. With Mass Effect 3 I cant wait to get away from it, to think of what could have been. Play anything else, spend your money elsewhere. Make a statement in the only way you can, DONT BUY THIS GAME. DONT RENT IT! DONT EVEN LOOK AT IT! DONT LISTEN TO THE REVIEWS OF PROFESSIONAL REVIWERS ON SITES LIKE GAME INFORMER AND ESCAPIST, THEY ARE LYING TO YOU TO LINE THEIR POCKETS! If you find yourself in the sorry state I am in, having wasted seventy dollars on this game only to be unsatisfied with what you got, keep it in mind for the future. EA and BioWare did this with Dragon Age 2, but even that was better then Mass Effect 3. I will not purchase any more of EAs products, not after they have back stabbed me by ruining the franchise Ive come to know and love.

Cut-corners are visible everywhere but it isn't until the finale that the game falls apart. The level of failure here is spectacular and historic: game ends in a disappointing, disjointed, contrived mess that betrays the trilogy's themes and your earlier choices. No matter what ending you play towards, the result is portrayed in the same cut scene with minor cuts and a different color scheme.

It negated every other aspect of the past 2 games and simply was the worst ending to a video game I've ever seen. If Bioware were to patch their ending with a DLC package it'd be fine.

Wulfburk,"The game has its problems, most of the time you cant really choose what to say, most of it is automatic, even if you picked otherwise on the start of the game and on the options, there arent enough ""renegade/paragon"" choices either, completed the whole game and only saw 3 or so. So this game is way more linear than ME2 and ME1, but i guess it is because there arent that many choices to make, all the choices you had were made on the previous games. But there are some good parts, gameplay has been improved ALOT, combat is way more satisfying, i didnt got bored the whole time i was fighting (unlike Mass Effect 2), some of the creatures they added were AWESOME (Brutes per say), and it was very interesting that some choices you made on Mass Effect 2 and 1 that you thought would help you against the reapers actually helped your enemy! Good job on that Bioware! Characters felt alive, i am glad from my three favorite companions two survided! Was sad to see five of my companions to die, one specially, i gotta say that was the saddest moment in the trilogy! Multiplayer is fun, but can get exhausting, but it sure is great! Plot was really good, but the last minute kinda made no sense, specially the scene after the credits, but even so i was satisfied! I gotta say the soundtrack was good, specially two specific musics, but it doesnt compares to Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 1, they were much better! The beginning of the game was the worst part in my humble opinion, if you compare to the epic start of Mass Effect 1 (the other Turian spectre is awesome!) , and specifically Mass Effect 2(as epic as any game gets) it will let you down! But overall a great game, Worst than Mass Effect 1, and slightly better/equal comparing to Mass Effect 2. Graphics were really improved, animations as well (taking out Anderson's walking animation.. of course) lighting way better, great anti-aliasing, and great voice acting. Levels were way better designed than the previous games, specially Palaven's moon, that was my favorite mission! So because all of that i give this game a 6! (gave an 8 to Mass Effect 2 and a 10 to Mass Effect 1) edit: i actually thought the ending through, and well, it kinda ruins the game, wont do another playthrough, but mainly because of the ending, the first 3 minutes and the auto dialogue, music is great, combat is great and areas are great, but the ending in a RPG game defines the experience, and sadly, in this particular game, it ****. -1 point for too much auto dialogue and a few bugs, -2 for the ending, -1 for the first 3 minutes.",6,2012-03-19,PC,user

BigPush,"Whereas Mass Effect 1 and 2 were conventional action-adventure stories set against a sci-fi background, the third and final installment in the Mass Effect trilogy attempts to address ""darker"", ""deeper"", and more ""mature"" themes. Unfortunately, the writers lacked the depth and maturity themselves to properly execute this sort of change in tone. The result is a poorly-constructed story poorly told. While I would argue that these problems begin almost as soon as the game does (where Shepard watches a child -- the first ever portrayed in the series -- being killed), the game's ending has generated the most controversy and so is where I will focus the rest of this review. It's an attempt at a tragic ending without understanding what makes tragic endings work. Tragedies have a long history in Western literature. While there is and has been a great deal of debate as to the structure of a tragedy, the core idea that makes a tragedy work well is that the hero's sad fate is the inevitable result of his or her character. Aristotle referred to this as the tragic hero's hamartia (which means ""mistake"", though it's often translated as ""fatal flaw""). This is a very important idea because as Nietzsche argued, tragedies resonate with us because they contradict, not confirm, a pessimistic view of the universe: the tragic hero doesn't experience pain and misfortune for no reason, but instead experiences this pain as a direct consequence of his or her own nature. In other words, an ending is only truly tragic if it's the result of the tragic hero's shortcomings; an ending where ""rocks fall, everyone dies"" may be rather sad, but because it happened at random it's not tragic. Mass Effect 3's ending fails because Shepard is not a tragic hero. In fact, Shepard does everything absolutely right up until the last 5 to 10 minutes of the game. Only then, by pure writer fiat, does he or she fail. There's no catharsis for the player, no satisfactory explanation, no hope. There is only ""deep"", ""mature"" death and despair. If games are ever going to be art, they need to pay better attention to the artistic traditions that have shaped our culture.",2,2012-03-19,PC,user

There were several moments during the game where I had to step back a bit, and just look around and absorb how awesome something was. Sure, there are a number of things that I found annoying. For example, I loathe the new James Vega character. The new multiplayer mode is very repetitive, and generally stupid. There is also the incredibly awful ending, and the annoying fact that one of the best squad members is only available through day one DLC.

They told about 14 different endings but all looked same to me , just colour difference ::)) .",0,2012-03-19,PC,user
j0kup4sk4n1m1,"Okay just finished the game. And I really feared for bad ending noticing all the negative reviews and all, but now that I have finished this... What's wrong with people these days? It seems that every game that has come out lately has been flooded with criticism and called ****. I played ME1,ME2 and now ME3 and I REALLY think this actually was the best of the series. At first I thought this is going to be bad game,but closer to the end the more I enjoyed. Maybe I didn't some characters in my team I would have wanted,but so what? They still were connected to story well enough for me and the side-quests were linked to main story very good (buggy quests and quest list was somehow hard to look at but meh). Oh and the day 1 DLC,yea smells like cashing on **** I actually bought it, and its not in anyway ""must have dlc"" story doesn't change and all that one team member does is insult everyone and tell how salarians licked they'r eyes and catched flies in his time. I loved the ending, haters can hate and if you got the ""wrong ending"" **** to be you. I'm giving this game 10 because all of you sad haters out there, really I would give this game 9/10 and this was great ending for great series. Thank you.",10,2012-03-19,PC,user
CTSV,"I'm almost ready to take it back and demand a refund. Most will comment on the endings, but the fact is, nearly the entire game is linear to the point of being comical. Frankly from what I can gather, none of your decisions in ME 1 or 2 have any real meaning past dialog or EMS changes in ME3. There is so much extra opportunity built in that anyone can pick the game up and play through it nearly identically as if someone had imported their save game. You can recruit the same species and complete the same quests.",0,2012-03-19,PC,user

Sinilin,"I love the previous games in the series but ME3 is a disappointment in so many ways. Firstly, I can not import my Shepard's face from ME1 and the game also has bugs all over. Also, the ending of the game is astronomically bad; it goes against everything Shepard has done in the previous games and what Mass Effect-series has really been about. Players choices do not matter at all in the end, all you get is pretty much a one and only ending. An ending that has plot holes as big as black holes, no conclusion and just leaves you empty. I can't believe Bioware actually did this. It's so bad.",0,2012-03-19,PC,user
BOSTONJOHN32,"Well i will start by saying that im amazed that critics scored this game nearly perfect but not many went into detail about ending, never mention it @ all or simply (and boldly) allowed readers to think the game was great from start to finish, then i happened 2 go ""outside the bubble"" and found smaller, more obscure reviews and the score factored in that the ending was ""literary suicide"" as one wrote. as quoted by r. ebert ""if you had to ask what it symbolized, then it didnt"" and i can say that this very much sums up the ending, struck in awe like many, i wasnt even sure if i had beat the game and had to check mt trophy in order to sort out if i did. thats just it, i felt like i did not know what had just happened and had to wait for the credits to scroll to know its over,and so i convince myself that ok maybe i just did not see the right ending and maybe i got the bad ending, ""yes that must be it, w/ so many endings i must have screwed up along the way and got the bad ending"" come to find out i got the desired and the most ""definative"" ending.. so then i go back and replay the mission etc and all the other endings are pretty much identical beside a different color or ""end sequence"" which consisted of a minute or so animation of walking another direction etc. i wont get into conspiracy theories or anything which is out of context but its kind of hard not to fall prey or offer self to some distraction or debate because we not only invested time, we invested emotion.. hours upon hours of carefully making right choices for a desired import etc, and for what? if i kind of got a heads up from critics that ""decisions do not play as significant a role in mass 3 as it did in the prior 2"" then i wouldve been able to prepare,lol.. but we are hearing words like art, story telling masterpiece also we were told by bioware that this would have multiple endings, a deeper consequence/decision mechanic, an end which would the opposite from lost, well no it may actually take the belt away from lost for the wtf just happened moment but the fact is that i shouldve known that a game which has a formula that works almost seamlessly, based primarily on decisions as well as story driven sequences which make the gamer care, think and DECIDE, it works so good that while i played every mass efect i made every decision carefully to prep my shep for the import into the next game, so if i am playing a game and already thinking of the next one then the system is almost flawless imo.. BUT it is obvious E.A had a bit of influence and brings me back to my point with this ""formula"", they deserted it and decided for MASS APPEAL rather than mass effect and i noticed this during the demo and how much emphasis was put on how one can play the game how one wishes and that the game can be toggled to suit any style, dont like stories? choose combat.. hate decisions? well you can toggle that too.. but wait, isnt that the part of mass effect which makes it like few others? and isnt that what i have spent many hours doing to have a desired and effective playthrough as well as end? was it just me or did it feel silly to scan planets this time around? as to say ""hey dont want to waste time scanning for elements, well we fixed that too"" huh? call me a loser, call me what you want BUT i enjoyed taking my time scanning for minerals and elements and launching probes with a feeling of purpose, because that was one of the many things which made me love this game, felt like what i did mattered and fulfilling. i can understand E.A 's stance from a business perspective, their knowledge and tactics of knowing that the fanbase of mass effect are going to buy this game regardless so lets find some fresh blood, but did the solid core and fan base have to feel jipped, let down, disappointed, confused and as well as angry in exchange for new profits/gains? well the core, the fans well we are mass effect. it breaths because we let it, we let it because it was great ,brought quality and emotion and stood apart from many other games and the exp was one like few others. but as much respect a game/developer may get through time can be undone in ten minutes.. i can not say that mass effect 3 was a bad game, but after putting in hours of decisions, careful choices to have it not effect anything in regards to the end , other than the war assets and ""co-op""readiness , well i feel like it was more of a ""okay hurry up and get this over with and go play co-op after"" the fact remains that mass effect 3 is still a solid game, but an ending which was promised to be the finale we dream about also being admittedly rushed well how does anything rushed ever result to anything other than sub par to par? a game is about the exp, mass effect is about a unique and gripping exp BUT the end ruined both.. its obvious a lot has changed in the gaming industry in the past 5 years, mass effect supports this in every respect, reapers went from FEAR INDUCING to PAWNS",6,2012-03-19,PC,user

sizuka2,"Mass Effect 3 is the culmination of one of the largest attempts at fusing gameplay and narrative to date. From the beginning, the bargain has been this: Bioware is telling a story about Shepherd vs. the Reapers; the players are choosing how Shepherd goes about this. For most of the game, Bioware tells a magnificent story, while providing changes and consequences to support the choices of individual players. This produces a remarkable degree of player investment. Unfortunately, the very end of the storyline deliberately averts any catharsis. People remember the peak and end of an experience. Bioware ensured that the peak experience of the trilogy was this ending, and that the ending caused revulsion and rage. Do not play unless you can ignore the story entirely - in which case, why not play a game less focused on story? Not recommended.",4,2012-03-19,PC,user

Thourne,I found that the endings completely destroyed any and all enjoyment from the franchise as a whole. They seemed illogical and almost in complete disconnect from the style of game play presented through out the entire series up to the final 10-15 minutes.,2,2012-03-19,PC,user
mcdonis,"I have about 300 hours playing Mass Effect before I ever picked up ME3 for play. Frankly I love the series and even though Bioware has made some questionable decidions (Terminator Human from ME2) I still found a lot of fun in each of the two previous installments. With ME3 I found that indeed a lot of the key mechanics have been improved, while most of the RPG elements were stripped out in ME2 they did manage to improve on the weapon element enough that I found it pleasing. The minigames from 2 are gone, as is planet scanning which is a good thing. I do miss something like the MAKO which added a needed element (Exploration) to the game. I think ME lacks this enough that its telling. The best way to describe this game is that the combat elements from 2 are streamlined and made into a game with limited dialog. I find in retrospect that the main strength of this series was always in the conciquences for your actions. In ME3 however I believe Bioware made a bad decision to bypass all of this with replacements that bypass any conciquences. I believe this is for the crowd who are new to the series but its telling and takes something away from the fanbase. Having said that its still enought to make a good game worthy of a score of 6 or higher, that is until you reach the climax of the game. Up until this point this series has been known for provding an experience based game that is defined more on the users choices rather than an A, B, or C path. It appears for the ending Bioware was unable to build an ending that followed the main game logic so they inserted a bland choose your path 1, 2, 3 to quickly end the series. To the uninformed this would not seem at first glance to be such a bad thing. However the thing that seperates ME from say Call of Duty in space is that who you TALK to and what you SAY to them really matters. When you decide to do X it affects Y. This was thrownout and a terribly written ending was inserted, to make matters worse the possible endings are drawn down into 3 main choices (15 sub choices) that are really just 3 endings. All of them slightly different and frankly bad. Very little is understandable, and nothing is really resolved. There are glaring plot holes in all of the endings, some so bad you see dead characters alive and well. For a series where the choice is the main attraction, to decide in the last few minutes to go out in left field is beyond me. Had the game been just average before the ending the score would be a deserved zero but since I was able to get 10-20 fun hours I have to up it a little. But the fact they ruined a series this badly is simply amazing....",2,2012-03-19,PC,user

The dialog can be hackneyed in places, and there are some cinematic bugs, but it's 90% gravy.

The ability to see your choices across all three of the games affect what alliances you are able to build in the final chapter is an accomplishment by Bioware and very satisfying to the player. Single player is a blast, and multiplayer is surprisingly quite fun and well implemented. Everything about the game is amazing, so I can't continue to knock it down just because the creative vision of the writers for the ending doesn't match my idea **** ending.

jamielikesyou,"I have a hard time believing this game is scoring so low just out of spite for the last 10 mins of an epic three game opera. Battlestar Galactica (2003) scores 9.5 here despite similarities between its story progression and Mass Effect. This is a polished, well written, produced, directed and acted game. The pacing is fantastic with more frequent, desperate combat sequences interspersed with meaningful interactive story segments. Major plotlines are wrapped up, sometimes joyfully and sometimes heart wrenchingly. Game performance on PC is tight with few bugs (I only had to restart a mission once due to a bug.) Graphically little has changed between 2 and 3 (on a bargain-mid system.) The sound effects are consistent from previous episodes. The tedious hacking/bypassing minigames are gone but another dreary scanning minigame (sorta) replaces ME:2's equally dull scanning game. There are few 'boss fights' and more scenarios forcing the player to outlast waves of enemies (i ddin't mind this but some may prefer more traditional game bosses.) Other negatives include the shoe-horned additions of Jessica Chobot and Freddy Prinze Jr. Their voice acting does not come close to matching the quality of the other cast like Jessica Hale, Brandon Keener, Seth Green or Carrie-Ann Moss. Overall, this franchise succeeds at what Bioware do best, write stories about characters that endear well beyond the games themselves.

Do you guys have any idea how many people are invested in this game, to see their stories achieve a more fulfilling end? What a logically insulting end, with loads of plot-holes? The only positive thing about this game was the entire process of rallying allies. Because I am a more RPG oriented player, rather than bang bang, pow pow... Yet even at that, I couldn't see any satisfying plot writing. The whole marketing hype, day one DLC, and Xbox kinnect components were already indications that something was off about this game. And yet you were so sure that this would be the best game in the series. EPIC FAIL, by literal definition! You probably can't fall deeper than this. Nonetheless, I gave you 3 for your blood and sweat poured into the making of the game. Please get a grip and revitalize yourselves before the shame becomes too unbearable. But first, get rid of that EA leech! There are a lot better publishers out there, smaller, yes, but treat their developers with respect.

linksmaster,"After completing the game one has to wonder whether Bioware diverted all their resources to Star Wars - The Old Republic. One can only hope that is the excuse for this ending to the series. Regardless of the excuses or, perish the thought these ""endings"" were actually planned out, the Nihilistic ending made me regret having spent time even bothering to develop a character. Perhaps it's a joke. Or a calculated business move to offer DLC that lets you have an ending where you actually have some impact. As such this mess is such a shame for what had been such a promising series. In my humble opinion it is that bad. And it's sad. Not the sadness of any ending but the saddest thing in the world: Wasted potential. The wasted potential from a sloppy meaningless ending to an otherwise previously well executed series. I have lost the will to replay Mass Effect due to the ending. If that was Bioware's (and/or EA's) intentions, then well played EA/Bioware. I won't bother to return.

DeadlyJoe,"ME3 was a genuinely enjoyable experience as far as games go. I prize control freedom above most other attributes ****, and Bioware has nearly perfected the combat controls with this final edition of the series. I rarely felt as if my character was getting hung up on walls or doing things that I wasn't commanding it to do. ME3 is going to define the RPG/Shooter hybrid genera going forward. In terms of gameplay, there is nothing to dislike about ME3. The game is at least as big as ME2 and the stunning graphics and audio really pull you into the universe. There is absolutely no reason that this game doesn't deserve a solid 10/10... if you were to consider only the game-side of ME3. The only reason why I'm giving the game an 8/10 is because I, like many others, didn't really appreciate the story's flustered conclusion. I don't expect RPG's to read like an Orson Scott Card novel, but the end of Mass Effect was truly one of the most disappointing endings of any book series that I've read or any game series that I've played in recent years. The ending felt rushed, poorly imagined, and anticlimactic.. It didn't give me the feeling of accomplishment that a 5-year long trilogy probably should have given. The ending also pens (in neon ink, underlined, and in bold) the penultimate closure to the series. It's difficult to imagine Bioware trying to create a new story arc around ME3's ending, which tells me that they want to ditch the franchise entirely, which frankly would make zero sense from a business point of view.

I cried a lot during the whole thing, I was so sad when it was over.

Zanadar,"The good: 1. Combat improvements: There's a lot to be said about the addition of the roll and what it does for the combat in this game. Suffice it to say, it's a great feature. The (re)addition of many RPG elements like a much wider array of weaponry coupled with the upgrade system is very welcome as well and with the expanded skill trees and the weight vs power recharge system gives you a significantly improved experience with the games shooter bits. 2. The writing: It's very strong at points. Bioware delves into a broader array of subjects than we're generally used to from them, like PTSD, the psychological strain of war and it's impact on not only those who fight it, but everyone else who suffers from it as well. Personal and mass tragedy is very prominent in the writing and handled quite well. Sadly, they do pull a few punches at times, but not enough to ruin the rest. 3. The length: It's not a short game. Perhaps not quite as large as ME2 if you factor in all the DLCs, but still definitely worth the 60 dollar pricetag in sheer gameplay hours. The bad: 1. Day one DLC: There's been enough uproar about this already, and frankly it's deserved, so I wont dwell on it too much. 2. Reduced companion interaction: Unfortunately you do not truly get to interact with your companions as much as you'd like. You rarely get actual dialog wheel conversations with them and there are no companion side-missions. This is not as much of an issue with returning characters as it is with new ones, but it would have been nice to have a little more dialog-tree conversations for companions. 3. The ending: A lot of adjectives have been applied to it already. I personally think ""awful"", ""horrible"" and so on are a bit of an exaggeration, but the truth is, it's far from good. Somewhere between disappointing and confusing is where I'd put it. The strangest thing about it is, Bioware have excellent writers as evidenced by the majority of the rest of the game. It simply defies belief that they did not understand this ending would not go over well, to put it mildly. The only explanation I can think of is that they're going to sell us a proper finish to the trilogy for 10 bucks.",7,2012-03-18,PC,user
ROGUE-BOLO,"I was a huge fan of the Mass Effect franchise (and Bioware games in general). Honestly, I even really like SWtOR. But Mass Effect 3 was a huge disappointment! What I hated most: 3. Meaningful interactions with most of your love interests from ME1 & ME2 reduced to unsatisfying cameos, 2. New movement options for Shepard in combat that can be horribly frustrating because they all share the same key as the one used to enter cover (i.e.: I have several times tried to sprint through a door only to find myself rolling back and forth between one side of the door and another, or attempting to leap over cover to flee attackers only to have the game decide I would rather ""go into cover"" on the wrong side, etc.) and worst of all 1. Three almost identical but horrible endings that totally ignored all of my choices made in the saga up to that point. In my opinion, they not only removed 100% of ME3's replay value (I played ME1 & ME2 dozens to times) but tainted the rest of the saga for me. As far as I am concerned, Jar Jar Binks did less to ruin Star Wars... After all, I did not sink 100+ hours into playing Star Wars after being told my choices would carry through and they would matter! And putting further salt in our wounds, these endings were abrupt, incongruous with the pace and story of the games up to that point, and glaringly inconsistent with established canon (For instance: If one Mass Relay detonating in The Arrival took out an entire star system what does losing ALL of them mean to the survivors in the galaxy?!!! How about a little QA, guys?) If EA/Bioware have any hope of painting themselves out of this corner, I would suggest they look on the Internet for all of the threads discussing ""Indoctrination Theory"" and deliver us a DLC to 'fix"" the endings along those lines ASAP. I know, it is your ""art"" and your ""artistic vision"", blah, blah, blah... But you sold the whole ME franchise with the promise of ""Real choices that make a difference.

Zpiff,"I absolutely loved the game, felt emotionally attached to all my characters and couldn't wait to see how my favorite gaming series of the last decade would be concluded... Now I wish I had stopped ten minutes before I did. The ending has completely ruined the experience for me, not only for ME3, but also the first two games. It's impossibly difficult to invest in a game you know will leave you an empty and broken husk at the end. As someone so bluntly put it in a forum post: It's like eating a magnificent three-course dinner, only to be served fecal matter for dessert, forcing your body to expunge it all at a lethal velocity. No matter how good the rest of the meal tasted, you'll leave on an empty stomach and with a terrible taste in your mouth. I wish this wasn't true. I really do.",5,2012-03-18,PC,user
Massiv,"Worst ending in the videogame history for the best trilogy in the videogame history. The last 10 minutes of Mass Effect 3 ruins the whole trilogy.

RiceMuncher,Dumbed down story with glaring plotholes that gets bigger as the game goes on. Saved by improved shooting mechanics. Uplifted by a few emotional + wow moments. Finally sank in the end due to the irrepairable logic and IDENTICAL ending cutscenes that invalidates all choices from ME1 onwards. Rest in Peace Bioware. I saw it coming since Dragon Age 2 came outâ,5,2012-03-18,PC,user
MassExodus,"This game should be judged as two separate entities awkwardly conjoined rather than one whole individual entity. The first part consists of the first 99.9% of the game, of which the story telling, the build up to the climax and the tension were all very well done, as expected for the final title to this series, and would earn a maximum score. HOWEVER, the last 0.1%, also now known as the infamous ""last 10 minutes"" was a very poorly executed of what is a brave and interesting concept, which had failed so catastrophically that the last part can get but zero score. Unfortunately, as the whole product is not whole without an ending, and the ending is but a fraction of the whole, the two scores must add up, however it must be ""calibrated"" for weight of importance. As the ""definitive"" end to the hitherto awesome series, the ending, despite its short length in this epic journey, has the heaviest weight, not only in the series concerning Commander Shepard, but also the entire franchise based on the story and trials of the Commander (as Bioware announced no future spinoffs will be based past the events of ME3), therefore its massive disappointment wiped away all the hard earned high score to bring the total down to 0, rounded down. This is not due to some petty tantrum but rather a summary of how that single misstep has probably destroyed the franchise's future, as already many have lost incentives for a second playthrough for ME3, let alone a replay of the first games, thus replayability has been thoroughly killed off. In addition, further spinoffs for the franchise in the future will suffer from similar disincentives due to them all inevitably based before the events of ME3, or at least before the last 10 minutes of it. Therefore, this franchise is lost, and lost because of this game, Mass Effect 3, or more precisely, the ""last 10 minutes"". I would like to take this space now to sincerely thank Bioware's staff for their time and effort to make these games, that it had been a wonderful journey, and that I really appreciated it. HOWEVER, that does not mean I will not deliver a scathing review on their products where and when it is needed.",0,2012-03-18,PC,user

AzureSkies,"Okay, I get it. You didn't like the ending. You didn't have that many choices. I understand. People fail to realize that this game is about the art of story telling that has player input, not that this is a story that the player has control of, making it dance like a marionette. This game is a beautiful work of art with fast-paced and innovative gameplay. The three-game story arc immerses you in a world that is so detailed and lifelike that you can't help get lost in it, and to me, that's what's important. Meaningful characters, intricate gameplay, and RPG-style player input all add together to create probably my favorite game of all time. And remember, folks: the ending of the game isn't the entire game.",8,2012-03-18,PC,user
Magniir,"My rating's slightly higher than the average and that's simply because I played the game knowing the ending was horrible but went in with an open-mind anyway. Frankly, Day 1 DLC doesn't bother me. It's going to come out anyway, I don't think it really matters when it comes out. Sure, it being on the disc might ****, but nobody has actually proven that every piece of data included in the DLC is on the disc as well. As for the game itself? Some of the best 20+ hours I've spent in a game. No really, it is. That 28 hours I spent on my first run-through wasn't bad, much of it felt really good. The environments were a bit repetitive from the second game but the character writing was absolutely fantastic, and much of the plot was fine until the last 10 minutes of the game. That's honestly the deal breaker for me. I give the game a 4 because the gameplay and character design were sold extremely well for me, but everything else was just plain crud. From the whole gimmicky ""War Readiness"" metagame to the absolute horrible ending. Those last 10-15 minutes are some of the worst minutes I've ever spent on any video game. It's not that it's bad that's the problem, it's that the ending doesn't really change that drastically from each option. Not only that, but your actions leading up to that point might as well not have happened, because doing the side-missions in the game doesn't really do much more than alter your ""War Readiness"" level, which doesn't change the endings as much as you'd expect. Other than these points, many of the ending scene is just absolutely confusing, non-sensical and it leaves you with much more questions than answers. That last one's really important. If I finish a story and I've got more questions than answers, and there is no sequel planned, then I really hate that story. Essentially it ends the story on a sort of cliff-hanger that you know you'll probably never get to see the bottom of, and that's just disappointing and somewhat cruel.",4,2012-03-18,PC,user

MiniSween,"A very pretty game that kept me engaged with the action, but that's the least I expect for the money these days. But that extra something that made mass effect 1 & 2 (in my opinion) so good? It's just not there in ME3. Many reasons to say this but I suppose one of the most striking is the Deus Ex Machina (i.e. the reapers cannot be defeated... oh wait we've got this thing that can defeat them). Whilst that is arguably only one small issue, to me it sums up the entire point of the story line. Obviously I like so many am not happy with the ending but only because it's full of plot holes, and even if we are to consider the unlikely ""DLC ending"" scenario then it feels like a cheap shot from Bioware. In summary not a bad game at all but certainly a disheartening one to any of us who played ME1&2... oh and EA are the devil",4,2012-03-18,PC,user
fjalke,"ME1 was a really, really good game, ME2 was amazing - ME3 is a huge letdown to its fans. ME3 is basically a dumbed down version of ME1 and ME2 with a poorly written story and disappointing ending. They have removed a lot of the RPG elements, converting the game to a FPS instead - there is no inventory and no selling of unused equipment. I actually liked the graphics, but, especially with female NPCs, many of them look alike and you get the feeling ""hey, i already saved you before"". The rich story and involvement in your crew mates from ME1 and ME2 have been reduced to meaningless chatter that can be boiled down to ""Its all so hopeless, I don't know if I can handle it - but now that you are here Shepard, everything is going to be fine"". In ME1 and ME2 there were some interesting game choices during the game, both for crew mates and story - none exist in ME3, it has been reduced to ""Are you going for Paragon or Renegade?"". There are no storyline attached to your crew mates which really hurts the game. The worst thing about ME3 is the ending - for fans it is a huge letdown. None of the choices during the game has any impact on the ending, and the ending doesn't really make any sense. If this game becomes a box-office hit, it is due to the success of ME1 and ME2.",3,2012-03-18,PC,user
alexbr,"The game is technically and script/story wise incomplete. Many plot holes, inconsistencies with prequels, odd side missions and even ""anime"" style character. Playthrough comparing to prequels is different and boring. Day 1 DLC of very important character considering prequels and lore, otherwise not present in the game but found by players on disk and activated by them without any download so what kind of DLC is that good question. Graphics are medium, Mass Effect 2 has better graphics, porting from consoles almost 1 to 1 without use of PC technical superiority, not even keyboard. A lot of things binding to ""space"" and you cant change it. Controls taken away from player in terms of less movement/view possibilities such as holstering for example. Much less dialogue choices but much more cutscenes without any choices. Bug of importing characters from prequels and even if imported not look same, only remotely similar. Game have good combat mechanics and very good sound/voices. Positioned as RPG/Action in advertisement. Third person Shooter with few RPG style dialogues and a lot of cutscenes in reality.

I've lost interest in continuing the game or even replay it anywhere in the near future. I was also frustrated by BW's Day-One DLC policy! It made me feel cheep!

Jedah,"Mass Effect 3 is a very entertaining game that follows closely the formula of ME2, but there are several MASSIVE PROBLEMS with it. I would recommend you do NOT purchase it at this time. If you consider yourself a loyal fan of the series, and appreciated the direction of the stories in the previous games, there is an excellent chance you will find the endings deeply unsatisfying. There is currently a campaign underway to convince Bioware to add an alternative to the current endings. You can find out more by searching for Retake Mass Effect. Multiplayer is a component Bioware decided to include with this game. Normally this wouldn't be a concern for single player focused players, but a player's participation in MP has a direct effect on your SP experience, specifically the ending. Even if you are a completionist type of player who carefully goes through the game checking everything, you may not have enough of a certain score to achieve the ""best"" ending if you do not play multiplayer. For those without a reliable internet connection, this is a serious problem. The day one DLC is a sore point for many gamers. While I would not call the content ""necessary"" for full enjoyment of the game, your squad would seem fairly bare without the inclusion of the character in this dlc, and considering the free squadmate offered very soon after Mass Effect 2's release, there is no reason this couldn't have been free as well (aside from corporate greed, which is exactly what this is). Finally, a smaller complaint, but one I suspect many fans will be upset about. A certain character's true appearance is revealed in this game. If you are a long time fan you will know exactly who I speak of. Let's just say the reveal is quite disappointing, and it involves photoshop. All these issues (minus the MP) are based on my own opinions. I have been a big fan of the series since the beginning, and 99% of the trilogy has been an absolute blast. I don't expect Bioware to remove or change the offenses I have listed above, but I would sincerely appreciate an alternative. If you share my opinion on some of these missteps, I would again ask that you do not purchase the game at this time. Affecting Bioware and EA's profits is the best way to voice your opinion.",0,2012-03-17,PC,user
Metalsand,"When I first saw the user ratings, I thought maybe a group of players were just being overly dramatic. I was dead wrong. While Bioware did a decent job on story, most of it was just reusing previous material from the first and second games. Unfortunately, this is the only good thing I have to say about this game. Combat feels like if I played the COD4 campaign 4 times in a row. The first and second times would be fun, but the third and fourth are just the same things over and over again, and it feels like with all game combat, depending on which part of the story you are on, they would use copy and paste more. The last battle was RIDICULOUS. It became a test to see how long I could hold down the left click button, with 30 enemies plus 5-10 mini-bosses coming all at once, and sooner or later, the sheer spam would always back me into a corner, where 5 of the minibosses would keep on using stun attacks to keep me from running or even firing back. The sheer length of the combat fights is terrible as well, it would be safe to estimate that over half of the fighting you will be doing in this game is just filler, especially the last mission. In only one small section of the last mission, I'd go up against waves that would take around 20-30 minutes to complete, with over 4 waves to complete. This is one SECTION which is 100% combat spam that takes more than 2 hours to complete. So you just shoot for 2 hours straight at the same enemies, using the same weapons and same tactics. I've watched chick flicks with women that not even including the benefits of the woman are MUCH more exciting than the combat in this game. It is a sad state of affairs when Bioware games turn into a giant grind instead of story, and the whole game feels like it was made by a 3rd rate developer that had no clue what they were doing and instead mashed everything together and called it a game. Bioware has been on the decline since ME2 and Dragon Age 2, but with the release of ME3, it is safe to say that they are a dead company now.",2,2012-03-17,PC,user

StavrosDim,"Mass Effect 3 is promoted by its publisher as a shooter game,while Mass Effect 1 was promoted as an RPG.Many RPG elements are absent in this game,and any improvement done is on the battle/shooter department.That was something I didn't liked,as I also didn't liked the fact that the actual places you can visit are fewer,the actual dialogues you can have with people are fewer,and the gameplay variety of this game is also shorter.While ME3 is the most linear of all the games in the series,it was bearable enough up until the end.I didn't had enough fun as I had with ME1 and ME2 while playing ME3,because many elements that I liked from past games were absent or in very short quantities in this one. While the actual battles aren't as predictable and annoying as in past game of the series,the fact that most quests in this game have battles tacked on gets them repeatitive and boring after an amount of time,and I ended up feeling that the game's gameplay was a chore I had to do just to see what happens in the **** I played it up until the end expecting a great finale and to see how the game would evaluate my decisions and gameplay,by seeing what kind of ending I would get. The ending wasn't what I expected.I could deal with a not so happy ending,but this goes beyond that. The game ends without showing me what happened to the main characters of the plot and the universe. I didn't saw anybody's reactions to the decision the main protagonist,Shepard took. I didn't saw how their lives changed,what happened in anybody's life after the final event of the **** game ends in a way that makes whatever Shepard accomplished in all 3 games to be rendered absolutely useless,and the player is left to wonder if it was even worth it taking all these decisions or not,and eventually destroying the Reapers or not,and actually if it was even worth it doing all that things that happened,and playing through 3 games to achieve them. I can't say I enjoyed or had fun with this game as with the rest of the series. Mass Effect 1 was like finding an airport full of various airplane models you could fly and got me all excited.Mass Effect 2 was like a lift off,like actually flying one of those planes,and it drove my enthusiasm to the hights of the skies.Mass Effect 3 was the landing,and a rough one where you realise that something went wrong,and you get to smash on to the ground with your face. While as a series it was one of my best ever until before ME3,I decided that the best thing to do is to forget ME3 ever existed.Shepard's story closes with the worst possible way it could close.Everything turns out to be futile,and the universe I loved so much by playing the first two games of the series got damaged so bad,it wouldn't make sense to make a new game with **** the last minutes of this game Bioware destroyed every reason I had to do whatever I was doing in the games of the series,which also devastated any replay value the whole trilogy could have,by killing the motives a player might had to replay these games.This is sad.Sadder than the actual ending.",7,2012-03-17,PC,user

The inclusion of MP added some life to the game, but beyond affecting my Galactic Readiness, I cant see myself playing this for long. While a great many people are upset with the ending, I found it to be quite satisfactory. You'd swear that the ending was ""it's all a dream and everything you been through is for nothing"". But the game ends with a conclusion to the current story, and leaves the future very much in the air. All in all, a great game, of the spirit of Star Control 2. Just dont expect perfection.

Slumbering,"Nothing hurts more than to lose time, money, and personal investment when it comes to an ending five years in the making. Here's a short list of the ways I feel used by Bioware/EA. -My money means nothing to them. It does not matter how much I have spent on their project, but only that I could possibly spend more if tricked into thinking I'll get what I paid for. -The story was ignored during a key portion of the game. The ending. Nothing that I could invest into the game would make the outcome any different. That is a kick to the face of every gamer alive. I did not buy a game to be told I should shut up and watch. -Shepard was the most human I had ever seen him. I loved how fragile my role was in the series and how much he relied on his team. When it mattered nobody who was fiercely loyal to him had his back. Apparently they all sought fit to run away when the galaxy needed them most. Does hope die with Shepard? -The theme is self sacrifice... self sacrifice... self sacrifice... etc etc etc but to push that theme onto the customer's wallet is freaking atrocious. -This list goes on just like DLC will be released for a dead franchise. Although beating dead horses seldom brings them back to life I hope EA/Bioware will understand that this horse is being beaten because it deserved to be beaten.

I wasn't expecting everything to be ponies and rainbows at the end, but a lot more choice and a more fulfilling, coherent ending was what I expected and was promised from these master storytellers, who have let me down. The game was also plagued with bugs: first it wouldn't install from the disk (tried to download the whole game from Origin even though I had a physical copy in the drive) so I had to find a workaround for that. Then it refused to import Shepard's head, so I had to go online to find a workaround for that. Then there were constant bugs and issues, and the game would often freeze unless I turned sound off in the config setting - meaning I had to watch most cutscenes twice - once in silent mode in-game, and again on Youtube walkthroughs to hear what was going on. Nice combat system and very emotional, but the ending really did overshadow things for me, hence the score. I will go back to playing ME1 and 2 for now. My advice is stay away until the bugs are fixed and (hopefully) the devs wake up and add some more endings - decent ones. Play ME1 and 2 and enjoy very successful story arcs which manage to be interesting and emotionally involving whilst retaining coherence and choice and not being excessively bleak.",2,2012-03-16,PC,user
Ochetazinco,"I am going to describe this game as accurately as I possibly can. First up I am going to say that this game is not an RPG anymore. They are describing it as an Action RPG, but you cannot roam around anymore (like around the Normandy, speaking to crew members, mining planets, commander Shepard's room ect ect). It is your standard third person shooter with upgrade elements from hoard games such as Bulletstorm or or The Darkness. I would in fact compare the game mechanics to The Darkness, because as you shoot and kill you gain points to upgrade. This game is more action adventure/third person shooter, and not an RPG by any scope of the imagination. You would not compare this game to something like The Witcher 2 or even Skyrim, as this game is more along the lines of Bulletstorm, I don't think it can even be considered a free roam game (like the Assasin's Creed ) This is a third person shooter with upgrade elements, such as, like I said, Bulletstorm or The Darkness II or even Red Faction Armageddon. Second of all the graphics look really bad. Mass Effect 2 looks better than this. The textures are all smeared and blury, and it runs so good on my computer that the characters look like and move as if they were made out of paper. Mass effect 1 probably looks better than this, probably, but most likely, I have all three games and can make a comparison. This is a really bad game and the reviewers did not give it a more just review because they were obviously paid off. This company just made it's money out of your impulse. What you bought ladies and gentlemen, was the mere illusion that this game was going to live up to it's predecessors. They fooled you by making you place pre orders with false advertising, and now you won't get back your money they technically stole. We commonly know ploys like this as ""Scams.""",0,2012-03-16,PC,user
SirCabbage,"** SPOILERS ARE IN THIS REVIEW ** The game was amazing, every story felt tailored to my choices and I felt rewarded when I could chose things others could not due to my diligence in the end of the game. The sound, music, both amazing, and while the graphics seemed a little aged they still worked. (well, bar the random 2D sprites and textures that sometimes popped up which looked like they were done in paint. As of now, I would have put a rating up for 9, or 10 for this game, it was fun, loads of stuff to do, explore, listen to, learn about.. the multi-player is damn addictive and the pokemon trading cards TCG booster pack system is both annoying but addicting. Then comes the bad, the bad that is so bad I am forced to rate this amazing game so low. The bad that is so terrible that it not only ruined ME3 for me, but also made me less likely to ever replay ME1 and ME2. Im sure you all see where I am going, and that is the ending. The endings themselves were weakly explained in story, full of story cannon errors and worse.. but thats not what makes me hate them. The fact is, that no matter what you do, no matter how well you play, no matter if you saved the rachni, made the geth and quarians be at peace.. anything.. Nothing you have done in the past 3 games matters to the ending, you could be good, or evil, and still get the exact damn same choices. The differences between the ending movies are also minor, with a simple colour change being the only thing to stand between controlling them, joining them and destroying them. In all three endings the major transport hubs used by the galaxy are destroyed, meaning that burning civilizations are basically forever alone in the universe and unable to build, travel or anything. A huge fleet of ships is either destroyed, or remains in orbit around earth with no way to get home, and basically all your choices didn't matter since in the end you essentially destroy the universe. Plotholes like my LI who was presumably killed during the final run to the beam mysteriously showing up on the normandy after, the weird joker trying to escape the beam for no reason, The starchild's excuse not mentioning anything to do with the dark energy mentioned all through ME2, or Shepards apparent inability to even question his reasoning. So lets recap why ME3 is good/bad Good - Epic Soundtrack - Rewarding to Import Savegames (during game itself) - Fun gameplay/combat - Improved squad interactions Bad - Ending Scenes are identical. - Ending ignors 3 years of your choices, no epilogue or future games possible unless during/in past. - Plotholes all over - Getting 100%, doing everything correctly, still you get punished by dying in all but one ending. Overall. Bleh Game 10/10 Sound 10/10 Ending -20/10 Total 0/30 :P Seriously, dont pass this game if you want to still love the franchise.",1,2012-03-16,PC,user
StMichael,"I reserve a score of 0 for games that are either non-functional, incomplete or grossly incompetently made. Mass Effect 3 fits squarely in the 2nd category. Rather than bring a conclusion to the Reaper threat, the game introduces a Deus Ex Machina ending (in the traditional greek sense). There's no final confrontation, no closure given, just 1 poorly made ending with 3 different color explosions (Literally, I'm not exaggerating here). It really does feel incomplete, and as a result does not deserve a formal review until the finished product is released.",0,2012-03-16,PC,user
Prajwal,"Great game, The story is the main focus and it's amazing. The endings could have been a bit better but it's still really good. Amazing and enjoyable combat, Great 3rd person shooting, Awesome weapons, and well done cover system. The graphics look fantastic but it has some glitches. The sound effects and the voice actings are amazing. It's one of the main reasons that makes you care for each character. Great game. Recommended for everyone. But it's better if you play the first 2 before this one.",9,2012-03-16,PC,user
OddSuperFuture,"The game is absolutely top notch until the ending is reached and you're presented with 3 choices. 3 choices which completely dismiss any decisions you've made prior in any of the 3 games. There are 3 ending scenes with no closure and a convoluted, out of character plot which disregard the franchises key themes. This destroys any motivation you may have to replay this game-or any of the other ME games.",0,2012-03-16,PC,user
Chupwn,"I was expecting a game superior to Mass Effect 2. I really liked how doing the loyalty missions and side-quests impacted the final showdown. The ending unfortunately looked like it suffered from the developer running out of time/money/ideas.

Berzerker556,"Too much EA not enough Bioware. The previous game (ME1&2) decisions have very little quantifiable effect, seems like rather than implementing all of the carry over they just fake it by having some scripted vocal moments acknowledged the decision, but to add no over all game effect. The combat and character building further builds on ME2 and is slightly improved. The weapons selection felt about right, and the class system feels about the same as ME2, maybe more refined and defined. The story starts strong and seems to hold up until you realize that you spend more of the game dealing with Cerberus and building the army than actually fighting the reapers. The army build felt generic and ineffectual on the very short battle for against the reapers. The fight for earth was also extremely short and disappointing. I was also let down by the ending but I won't spoil it. Overall, it doesn't seem like they made the game they set out to. The decision and force/team building mechanics felt partially implemented, or implemented to give the illusion of choice/consequence. The game is suppose to be about the battle for earth, but there really is no battle, there is a war, but the player doesn't get to enjoy much of it. The ultimate resolution also felt very generic, a little to ""chosen one"" for my taste. It is a decent game for $60 and the DLC does add to the experience but overall it was a slight letdown having played ME2 for the first time a few days before ME3 launched and immediately transitioning to ME3.",8,2012-03-16,PC,user
UniTroop,"It's very difficult to rate this game, as player experience will depend a lot on how ""in to"" Mass Effect they are. In all fairness, 98% of the game is great. Unfortunately, the abysmal conclusion to the story will ruin a lot for players who are even moderately hooked on the Mass Effect story. I can't believe Bioware made a trilogy of astonishing quality, and then dropped the ball on the last yard.",5,2012-03-16,PC,user
endtherapture,"The gameplay of this game is great, it builds on both of the previous games and refines the gameplay into a perfect, challenging whole. The story for the most part is great, really great, it has emotions and is really engaging and the characterisation is great. However then you get to the last 15 minutes of the game it it ruins everything. It was great up to there, but then it gets ruined, a great game up to that point, but the ending sequence leaves a sour taste in your mouth.",8,2012-03-16,PC,user
weskandel,"I'm in the camp of people who loved Mass Effect 1 and really struggled with all the changes made in Mass Effect 2. I still thought 2 was a decent game and a well told story, but I would not have given it a perfect score. That being said, I went into Mass Effect 3 with hopeful but guarded expectations. I expected there to be something which was going to let me down. Also, I started seeing headlines about the ""fan outrage"" regarding the ending, before I completed the game. Again, I was expecting to be let down. What I feel I got out of Mass Effect 3 was the most cinematic, expertly told and emotionally engaging stories of the entire series. Even upon completing the game and experiencing the now infamous ending, I'm still blown away. From a technical standpoint I played it on the PS3 and experienced some significant frame rate slow downs and even temporary freeze ups. But I don't feel like it was so bad that it ruined the experience. One major issue that occurred however, was for about thirty minutes the game would freeze up when I tried to enter the area with all the refugees. Even with these technical hangups, I still give Mass Effect 3 the highest rating possible. It is a masterpiece.",10,2012-03-16,PC,user
Conranos,"Do not be fooled by any of the negative comments. These people do not know of which they speak. The Mass Effect story is purely amazing. I went and get copy's of all 3 no DLC just the games. I played through all three back to back. This is THE of the most complex and powerful story I have evens seen. It can be seen though the eyes of anyone. Each person will come up with a different meaning. This game has more than earned a 10. This is the pinnacle of all story driven games. I recommend that you get the entire series. Play them back to back, skip the DLC, and really focus on the story. I personally wish to thank Bio Ware for this amazing game. It has been to long since I have had to contemplate the ending to any story.",10,2012-03-16,PC,user
Drekor,"This game is a great example of people expecting more than is possible. The game continues with the same story, same theme and same style as the previous ones. Expands on the character customization available in the previous two, makes ""scanning"" much less ridiculous and introduces a lot more choices which shift how you travel to the end. The ending certainly was not the greatest, it seems like it was a scene that should have been played over several hours rather than 10 minutes but that doesn't detract from the fact the rest of the game was well done. Many people are upset because they feel your choices don't matter, which I don't agree with, the way your journey progresses through the game as well as dialogue is heavily influenced by your previous choices. I think again people were expecting too much and that the ending would have a variation for every combination of choices out there ... which would be absurd.",9,2012-03-16,PC,user
A_Person,"When I see all these glowing reviews by game websites giving it nigh perfect scores, its glaringly obvious that their integrity and objectivity is compromised. In fact its almost comical how much the websites try and cover for its flaws. My favorite was one where they condemned bioware changing the endings because ""oh its art you'll ruin it by changing the ending."" I like to think that if somehow a 6 year old drew a big turd on the Mona Lisa, the museum would do everything it could to restore the painting by TAKING OUT THE BIG TURD ON IT. What they are really praising isn't the game it is the amount of money they received in advertising from the game's publisher. Mass Effect 3's ending (because its really only one) is a slap in the face, a total disgrace to the brand. Whoever the lead writer was for the ending, and whoever gave the okay for that crap needs to be fired. Furthermore I've never encountered an ending that made me hope for a cliched ""It was all a dream"" sequence as much as this one. This ending is so poorly put together it is on par with the likes of Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions, wer're talking total plot and lore breakdown. The final offense was the after credit sequence which just adds insult to injury. The only person that could of made a poorer ending was George Lucas.",0,2012-03-16,PC,user
gotthammer,"Mass Effect was a great game, the only complaints I can recall being performance (optimization?) issues and the rather clunky inventory. Mass Effect 2, counting the DLCs (esp. Lair of the Shadow Broker), was also a great game. It wasn't perfect : some aspects felt over-simplified when compared to the first game, and the resolution of the main story could have used more choices. Still, a great game. Mass Effect 3, the finale of a trilogy, was also a great game, for the most part. Decent graphics. Great looking locations/environments. Pretty cinematics/FMVs. Dramatic (if a bit overly so, at times) sequences. Superb score/soundtrack. The dialogue, like the previous game, was mostly solid (ok, there were some cheesy/seeming forced/heavy-handed bits, like a few speeches). The plot was 'ok', but could use some beefing up/more work, but it was, for the most part, 'ok' (not counting the ending). Almost everything was great. Almost. The ending, IMHO, ruins, not just the game, but, as it is the ending of a trilogy, the franchise as well. The ending doesn't feel to be 'in character' with the setting or even the overall feel of the game and the franchise. The ending seemingly negates any choice and also disregards (or doesn't reward) the efforts of the player throughout the game. It is very, very disappointing. The ending alone makes me unable to, in good conscience, recommend the game to anyone I know. Unless Bioware were to 'fix' the endings by providing more options/choices, as well as clarifying the mess that is the current set of endings, I won't recommend the game, nor will I purchase any downloadable content for Mass Effect 3. Pros: Visuals, environment, soundtrack, dialogue/voice acting/humor, cinematics/FMVs, quantity of weapons Cons: Ending, fewer squad mates, graphics options too limited, lack of inventory/over-simplification of RPG elements, some dialogue, quantity of armor choices, lack of other 'hubs' (there's only the Citadel), some aspects feel rushed (example: under utilization of some characters, the ending, etc.)",3,2012-03-16,PC,user

The strengths of the Mass Effect series are still going strong, with gameplay in particular having been improved compared to the second game. Strictly speaking, I only think the game is worth a review score of 9, but I'm going with a 10 in order to do a small bit to counteract the immense amount of butthurt being levelled in so many of these reviews.",10,2012-03-16,PC,user

Or whether or not to save the collector base, saving or killing the quarians and geth again, curing the genophage, Samara or Morinth??? Yeah none of that mattered at all. Hope you didn't actually get emotionally invested in any of those choices like I did or you might just break the disc after the impossibly poorly put together ending.

There are no RPG elements in this game, its miserable. There is no exploring planets, the citidel is very small and not open. ME2 made the game more basic, but ME3 took it down to a stupid level. This is NOT what we expected/wanted from bioware. And the ending is not at all based on anything you did in any game what so ever. I repeat not at all based on your choices. Several things in the game happen in cutscense. Meaning that you dont have full control over the choices shepard makes. Not that it matters. Avoid.

The intense talent of Drew Karpyshyn and the masterful writing he penned in gone and now dudebro one liners and weak dialogue and plot abound.

Alpha_Nexus,"The game is has changed a lot from ME1 and ME2 for both good and bad. The Story is engaging and the way the reveals bits of story without a cutscene is great, like hearing NPCs talk as you walk around. I find myself stopping between 2 NPCs chatting just to find out more about the backstory. However, the story is more linear than previous games and doesn't feel like you're making Shepard your own character. Basically your dialogue choices don't really affect the ending, instead it relies on your collecting ""War Assets"" (setup alliances, completing side quests, scan planets for items, etc...) for slightly different endings. Even then, the endings only differ with your choices in the last few minutes of the game. It makes it feel like your actions through the game really doesn't matter. I like how Bioware allows players to customize how they prefer to play the game by giving them options to ignore selecting dialogue to focus on action or make shooting easier to focus just on story. The War Readiness system is an interesting idea that I like in theory but it makes the game feel more ""grindy"" because you have to do all these side quests and scan all these planets. It also feels like a cash grab by Bioware/EA because you can increase the Readiness by buying their iPhone game or, in multiplayer, you can buy upgrade packs with real money. You can get the Readiness to 100% without paying extra or multiplayer but you would have to do a lot of side quests and exploration. The Multiplayer feels a little less ""grindy"" because it has a good variety of maps and enemies and you can unlock new weapons and upgrades by using in-game currency (gained by playing online games). The co-op multiplayer is a pleasant surprise. It reminds me of playing Uncharted 2 Multiplayer with swarms of enemies and little objectives to complete (assassinate targets, defend an area, activate devices). I had alot of fun with friends playing the game. There are some bugs with multiplayer that makes it annoying. It would be nice to be able to reorder your quickbar skills like in Singleplayer and the button for cover/activate is unreliable. I get stuck in a nearby cover instead of activating an objective. The cover system is worse in this game than ME2, my character sticks to places too easily. If Bioware tone down the distance of when to automatically stick to cover, it would make it alot more tolerable. The shooting elements feel good but nothing like a hardcore FPS. Getting a gib kill feels good and the aiming system feels right with the right setting (I had to turn off ""Mouse Dampening"" to feel better). The simplified inventory system, shopping system, and weapon upgrading is a lot better in this game than the previous games. The From Ashes DLC, is great. It seamlessly integrates with the main game and feels like part of the main game. It gives such an important background information about the Mass Effect Universe. The DLC character is great and the conversions with the character is worthwhile. I honestly cannot see how this DLC be excluded from the main game, the content adds so much depth the game. This DLC should have been available to all players who brought the game new, it feels like it's such a key component to the Mass Effect story. Shame on EA/Bioware for making this a paid DLC on Day 1, instead of working on bugs or improvements. Also, the idea that you can spend real money to unlock random stuff in multiplayer (with no guarantee of getting everything) adds to the feeling that EA/Bioware are trying to squeeze cash from their fans. Conclusion: The game mechanics definitely improved overall, but the story doesn't feel like a classic Bioware RPG where you have complete control over Shepard's development. I cannot give this game a perfect score because of some bugs and the Day 1 DLC (From Ashes) should have been free to all players that brought the game, like in Dragon Age 2 with Shale. It integrates so nicely to the game that it should have been part of the game from the start. This also gives the impression that EA/Bioware trying to squeeze as much money out of their loyal fans. When they should have spent that extra time polishing the cover system, speech system, animation system, or fixing save game importing instead of making this Day 1 DLC. If they had even waited a month to push out that DLC, it would have made less fans feel like they're getting robbed for supporting the franchise.",7,2012-03-16,PC,user

Sadly, the very last 10minutes of Mass Effect 3, takes everything from the trilogy, throws it down the drain makeing all your choices youve worked so hard for meaningless. ME3 was supposed to answer all questions, and conclude the series. Instead, it leaves more questions than anything, with a non sensical end that evokes no reponse what-so-ever other than ..

PasKarma,"I loved the ME series. This final game was supposed to bring all the previous choices of the games together, adding replay value, and creating one of the greatest rpg/shooter hybrids to date. Instead, the final moments of ME3 throw all your previous decisions out the window and each of the 3 ending choices are nearly identical, all vague explosions with little to no closure as to what happens afterwords, none of your choices matter. They messed up, bad. Other than those final moments, the game was extremely enjoyable, it was just such a bad ending I can't give it a positive review (it destroys any replay value of the previous games as well, since none of those choices matter). Combat mechanics wise, they mad improvements and complexity to ME2 without making it overly redundant like ME1. As for multiplayer, it's repetitive and not what anyone really asked for, but still fun, mainly since I'm a ME fan though, not because it's anything groundbreaking with lasting value.

Praedor,"I have been a huge fan of the series since it began with Mass Effect 1. I played ME 1 six time and then played ME 2 eight times and was anticipating playing ME 3 a similar number of times. I had 4 different Shepards I was looking forward to importing and playing through. I played it once. One time. That was more than enough. The game is actually fantastic, with a great score, some pretty good interactions and dialog, some of it quite moving. It works well until the last 15 to 20 minutes then it goes to hell in a handcart. A game that was touting as being all about player choice affecting the outcome, a game where the developers promised that your decisions in ME1, 2, and earlier in game 3 would impact the final outcome was a COMPLETE lie. There is ONE ending. One. It is identical in all ways no matter what you do in all the previous games, no matter how you play, what decisions you make, it ends the same but with different colored terminal explosions. Woohoo. ALL the time you spend on side missions, doing good or bad deeds, making peace treaties, ending conflict, uniting alien civilizations, collecting allies and materiel is all for naught. No matter how you do it you get the exact same nonsensical, blatantly illogical (in game and in real life) ending.

FormerHuman,"There is a strange, unseemly trend developing on the Metacritic site when it comes to games reviews, and it's extremely conspicuous. It seems any title that develops something of a following (namely, franchises such as this one) will result in such extremely polarised reviews and ratings (typically with extraordinarily vague or unfounded assertions) with one half asserting that the game is quite simply something heavenly, whilst the other half express that the game has basically ruined their lives. Maybe this sentiment is closer to truth - the lives of those who express such outrageous venom for games that don't meet their (usually pretty unreasonable) expectations must be pretty much over from the start. Regardless, ignoring the idiocy of nerd-rage and coming back to the case at hand: Mass Effect 3. I completed my first play through today and so now I feel reasonably qualified to comment. I've been a fan of the series since Mass Effect originally appeared on Xbox, and have since played both the first two games on 360 and subsequently on PC, and now the final installment on PC from the get-go. I've played these games extensively, and have taken great enjoyment in exploring their finer details. None of the games are perfect, but then none of them are identical - each has it's own identity and that is something I am very grateful for. The first in the series had more in common with Biowares classic Knights of the Old Republic, with a rather rubbery combat system that was borrowing heavily if vaguely from Gears of War (reasonably new at the time), to great effect. The RPG elements were effective if occasionally too sprawling for their own good, issues largely addressed in Mass Effect 2, and then also replaced with all new (again, relatively minor) complaints. The issues that came with Mass Effect 2 are again largely well addressed in Mass Effect 3, but at a compromise. The narrative is arguably more streamlined in the third game, but this suits the story exactly - as Mass Effect was a game of exploration, Mass Effect 2 a game of intrigue and darkness, Mass Effect 3 is a game of the horrors of war, the realities of post traumatic stress disorder, the despair of losing friends and the uncertainty of success. At no point during the game was I ever convinced that things were going to go well - an ending I wouldn't be disappointed with so much as perhaps saddened by, in the tradition of games more like Silent Hill 2 rather than your average gung-ho shooter. I was anxious about failing. Success wasn't an eventuality, a guarantee, as it wasn't in ME2 either - you could lose your colleagues all too easily, and they would never come back once they were gone. There is a brutal absolutism in this universe that mirrors our own, and it's uncomfortable and refreshing all at once, because rarely is such a concept really approached so clearly and executed so well in a game. Sure enough, other games may casually kill off central characters, but rarely do you have much emotional investment in them. With this cast, they've been with you for a long time by this point, you've shared a lot of experiences, a lot of character development, a lot of choices. At one point in the game, I had to make a choice, the consequences of which were both tactically sound but also morally reprehensible. Did I make the right choice? Yes, because so much is at stake. Everything is at stake. And this translates from the moment the game starts until it's extraordinary ending sequences. I've seen a number of negative responses to the ""ending"" (note, there are at least three distinct endings available, though I have only seen one so far) - certainly, the one I chose (and that is a slight disappointment, in as much as it was the case in Deus Ex: Human Revolution - pick your button) was unusual, but in fact quite extraordinary and fascinating and entirely in line with the truly epic scale of the Mass Effect universe, but also reflective of the more cerebral literary and cinematic roots in science fiction that the developers have drawn from (there is more than bit of Arthur C. Clarke in the games' DNA, and that is no bad thing). There is little else I wish to talk about. The functional elements, the combat, navigation, are all excellent. The cover system is occasionally problematic, but not in a way that ruins the game in any way. The co-operative multiplayer is very enjoyable and although I have low opinion of EA for using 'Day One DLC' in any title, the quality of the content is such that whilst it's not so much 'forgiven', it is largely irrelevant. It should have been included for everyone, because it's too important to miss. Most elements are improved upon, some are more consistent with the previous game - likely more down to the continuous nature of the games - so there are fewer massive leaps in terms of visuals than some people may expect. Not to say anything is lacking, however, because frankly, there isn't.",10,2012-03-15,PC,user
stealthops77,"Originally while I was playing through the game, I thought, ""this is so epic!"" And that thought remained true until the last 15 minutes of the game... Those last 15 minutes pretty much just took a **** on your face and made you feel extremely dissatisfied. It takes away replay value for the entire series because you know that the outcome will be exactly the same, and that you will hate it just as much as you did the first time you played through it. The multiplayer on the other hand is not that bad. But it does get boring after awhile since your pretty much going through the same enemies over and over again on five different maps. I know some people absolutely love it and some don't like it at all. So its all about your tastes.",2,2012-03-15,PC,user

Niroo,"Mass Effect 3 features a decent single player storyline that, despite the early introduction of a fanciful 'Secret Weapon of Awesomeness', is quite entertaining for about 20-25 hours. The gameplay works, even if it's rather repetitive and doesn't really expand on what ME2 had to offer. The much discossed ending of the trilogy is indeed a storytelling disaster, the only part of which that speaks in BioWare's favour being the fact that they had the audacity to make their deus ex machina an actual ""god out of the machine"". I wasn't too impressed by the multiplayer, which, with it's 11 waves of whack-a-mole, is only mildly more interesting than the bot-servers of earlier FPS games.",4,2012-03-15,PC,user
jimbo32,"The train-wreck of an ending combined with the single-player storyline results depending (somewhat) on multiplayer participation make this - easily imo - the worst BioWare game I have ever played. I've been playing BioWare games on my PC for nearly 15 years, and have never been so disappointed. Combined with the Day One $10 DLC and the company's accompanying lies, I'll be thinking hard before ever buying another one of their games. (For those not aware, BioWare stated that the ""From Ashes"" DLC was developed after the game was finished and in QA. Players poking around in the data files on the game disks have since found a bunch of the DLC-related models and voice-overs.) Edit: With all the speculation regarding the endings pretty much done due to BioWare's recent statements, I'm revising my review downward. This is the ending the company wanted, and this is the ending we need to accept. So ME3 now gets a 1/10 from me. If they do something about it at some point, I may revisit the score. But as of now, I'll never be buying another EA title again.",1,2012-03-15,PC,user
WaneY,"Firstly I am really annoyed that an 'essential Priority Mission' has been charged extra and packaged as a Day 1 DLC. If it was cheap then it would have been acceptable, but it is way over priced for what is something that improves the (back)story. Squad mate AI seems worse then in ME2 and makes the game harder then it could have been. There are a few other small issues such as the odd bug, game crash and game stalling upon Exiting. But such is the quality of the game, I still give ME3 10 out of 10. Totally refined and a joy to play",10,2012-03-15,PC,user
darkdefeat220,"I actually find myself disagreeing with many of the reviewers here: the bulk of the game was rock solid storytelling, filled with the harsh choices and consequences you have come to expect from Mass Effect. The story ventured into emotionally wrenching territory more times than I can count, even several times with NPC -to-NPC dialogue. If you hear two characters talking, keep leaving and coming back until you hear their whole story and then google it if you still don't get it, you won't be disappointed. The character-driven subplots have fitting, satisfying endings that never fail to bring a tear to one's eye (the emotion represented by the tear changes). HOWEVER, bioware tried to be clever with the ending and failed more completely than I ever would have imagined possible. I always feared a trite ending, but what ME3 contains is far worse. Not ""worse"" as in ""dark"", ""worse"" as in ""doesn't achieve any goal which an ending might be expected to achieve"" and ""makes a mockery of the entire series"". An ending is supposed to bring a certain amount of closure, it's supposed to be the culmination of decisions made throughout the story (in ME's case, choices you get to make). ME3's ending HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE CHARACTER'S ACTIONS (well, you can choose between 3 nearly identical endings, but the choices I'm referring to are the ones you made over the entire series). Parts of the ending make little to no sense (in order to make sense of them you have to inject MAJOR plot points that AFFECT the story) or simply yell ""hah, nothing you did mattered"" in your face. We were promised differently (explicitly, several times). BioWare, what were you thinking?!?!?!",0,2012-03-15,PC,user
Nikkolette,"Mass Effect 3 is a cemetary of hopes. 1. They promised us to remove terrible mining system but gave us even more boring and annoying one. 2. They promised that every our descicion will matter. No descision affects ANYTHING in the game. More to this - all your previous descicions from ME1 and ME2 are discarded and you are forced into almost linear storyline. 3. Your actions have no result - should you cure genophage or decide to keep it - THAT DOES NOT AFFECT ANYTHING. 4. Only your score matters, endings decided Deus Ex style - you just have 3 descicions that determine what ending you get, and your score determines your survivability. 5. The endings is one of the most terrible in game history. To the point where people will gladly buy DLC with a single new ending. 6. Renegade and Paragon scales are completely useless in the game. 7. the game degraded from RPG-Shooter to Shooter with a bit of RPG elements. It is common for such projects to attract unrealistic expectations from fans but here we have a situation when even features, promised by developers were not fulfilled or implemented awfully. As Dragon Age 2 was a disappointment, Mass Effect 3 is a disappointlent of 2012. I only hope new Bioshock will not fail us.",0,2012-03-15,PC,user

Arcero,"I have not yet finished the game but I am three quarters of the way through it. So far, this has been the best game I have ever played; the content is amazing, the events I predetermined in the previous installations are flawlessly synced to the plot-line. Mass Effect has not been my favourite series before this game. Perhaps the ending does ruin the game, I wouldn't know I have not yet reached it. But even if it does ruin the series, I will not give this game any less than 10/10 for the journey and for BioWare. BioWare was, is and in prospect will be the ONLY good RPG developer, you will not find any other developer (perhaps excluding square enix) that makes such elaborate stories. If BioWare dies... RPG dies. Also, somehow people seem to completely misunderstand this business. The choices from previous games CAN'T decide the whole outcome of the game because (1) they need to appeal to a range of audiences, not just complete Mass Effect fans or complete old-style RPG fans because they just wouldn't make enough profits and (2) the old decisions which predetermine the games mechanics would make the game either laughably easy or terribly hard plus would add another couple of years to cover every plot hole which comes with them, etc. You can't appeal to everyone, e.g. I like text based RPG's and action in Mass Effect does a lot to aggravate me, I play and always have for the story, if they took out the action, they would appeal to a minority but lose a lot of clients whereas when they pump up the action, slacking the story slightly, they will gain customers. Although I won't like it, I will still play it as if you really play for the story, you have to continue whereas when you play for action, you just drop it without caring.",10,2012-03-15,PC,user
taicleis,"First of all, this is a fantastic game, and is primarily being assaulted by the gaming community equivalent of indie hipsters. ""I liked them before you knew about them"" and ""they're too mainstream"" is basically all they are saying. What's more, not all ME fans feel that way - not by a long shot. I've been an obsessed ME fan since ME1 came out on PC. I've preordered both sequels and played them non-stop the minute they were mine. I pore over each game. I love Mass Effect - all three games - more than any other franchise. ME3 isn't perfect, but anyone giving it anything less than a 5 or 6 is just being unreasonable. If you rate ME3 a 1/10, what the hell do you rate ""Barbie's Beach Adventure""? What score does ""Deer Hunting Safari"" get? There are 10 numbers to choose from for a reason. Okay, you didn't like the story details. You didn't like the combat. How do they compare to Deer Hunting Safari though? How about the graphics? Do they look like Deer Hunter? Look at the environments. How about the music? The sound? The cutscenes? The replay value? Even if I hated ME3 (and I love it), I could never justify anything below a 5. The game has too much content, too much polish, and attempts something never before done with a trilogy. I can't look at the cinematic flair of the environments and give that a 1. They're beautiful. I can't listen to the stunning soundtrack and give that a 1. It's breathtaking. Even if you hate the story, even if you hate the combat, there is content in this game that is not a 1. Therefore, giving it a 1 is impossible unless you are not actually reviewing the game. If you are not capable of actual analytical reasoning - of looking objectively at the game's strengths and weaknesses, why you liked it and why you didn't like it - then you shouldn't be reviewing it. In MY opinion, the only real weakness the game suffers is that the parts where they chose DLC-character-style dialogue can at times make things awkward. Sidequest acquisition, for example, often occurs when I'm no longer any where near the person asking for help - all I did was run by on my way somewhere else - and now I have a quest I know nothing about. It's possible to miss conversations entirely this way. Overall, it's not a huge problem but it can be annoying every now and then. I had some concerns coming into ME3, but really, none of them were realised. I was concerned about whether my past decisions would really play into the story - they do. Forget what you heard. Your choices make a difference. Not just in who is alive to be a part of ME3, but who survives ME3 as well. Another thing that your past choices influence a lot is CONTENT. People playing the game the first time through, who aren't familiar with Bioware's tradition of storytelling rich in details, might have no idea of how many moments, dialogues, and details they have missed either by having lost a party member somewhere or by having made a different choice long ago. In this day and age of YouTube, people are content to just watch every alternate possibility online - not taking the hours and hours to get it for themselves - and say that the game is too linear or that their choices didn't make a difference in the content of the story, not realising that one of the greatest strengths of Mass Effect is the multi-faceted nature of the story that provides a thousand versions of the same story with a thousand different scripts and content. I won't spoil the endings, but I really don't see the problem with them. I saw them coming. The overall theme of the game is sacrifice. The mission on Tuchanka gives a clear example (and I use very vague wording here to keep it spoilerless): there is a good sacrifice with a happy result, a sacrifice with additional death that could have been prevented, another TYPE of sacrifice that involves betrayal and an unforeseen cost, or a betrayal which costs nearly everything but manages to get the job done somehow. ME3 is all about sacrifice and which sacrifices you are willing to make, and which sacrifices those choices will make necessary down the line. Even if you don't like that - even if you hated the way that worked - it took a lot more work, a lot more vision, and a lot more planning and execution than Deer Hunter. Giving it a low score even on those grounds alone is childish. The game is a massive undertaking and is the farthest thing from simple, whether or not the people spoiled by YouTube videos and online walkthroughs can see that. Love it or hate it, it deserves a very high score. Professional reviewers can see that. If you can't, don't review the damn game. Learn to count instead.",9,2012-03-15,PC,user
QuantumHD,"I am a fan of the ME series. I've been playing with involving my self into the game and choosing the actions as I think i would choose in situations presented in the game.

I cared about my friends, I've tried to do the be myself in the game. I felt real emotions and that was beautiful from the first ME to the last. Amazing game with amazing epic story, incredible characters and design the best sci-fi game EVER! But why then I gave 7/10 but not 10/10? Because of ending witch is just terrible.

Ireland914,"Fantastic finale to a series I have enjoyed from beginning to end. A gripping story as usual and a satisfying ending to the trilogy. Some minor flaws that don't take away from a thoroughly enjoyable gaming experience. Excellent gunfights with a decent cover system. Interesting characters (new and returning) with unique and fascinating backgrounds and fates. Some choices you make actually do seem to have significant consequences on the final outcome. Well-paced action with lots of side missions to keep you busy between completing primary objectives. Completing every aspect of the game can take upwards of 20 hours for full completion. Satisfying ending options that bring the Mass Effect trilogy to an epic conclusion. Some negatives include the fact that there is no significant improvement in visuals. Pretty environments and models more graphics options and higher-resolution textures in some areas would have been nice (eg. armor and player bodies in general). Some minor graphical glitches and missing textures but nothing too serious. Some side missions descriptions are a little unclear as to what your objective is and how to accomplish it. Also, some way to keep track of an inventory of items you've collected for side missions would have been nice. Overall, I was very happy with this game and how it brought the Mass Effect trilogy to a close. The story is just as good as it was in the first two games, the graphics are pretty good, and there aren't any game-breaking flaws. It really gives you the sense that the fate of every sentent being in the galaxy is resting on your decisions.

Developing relationships between crew, not only romances and friendships but also growing animosity. All well and good.

Up until the ending...I have hard time believing that people who wrote Mass Effect universe suddenly had a writing stroke and spawned this horrifying abomination of an ending. Screw the limited choices but the sheer story telling behind is stripped of all logic. It resembles incoherent symbolism of Lynch meeting Van Trier with pseudo metaphysical babbling.

Lycanthrope,"I have never been so disappointed in a game as I have been in Mass Effect 3. The story, for the most part, is well-constructed and engaging--essentially the kind of stuff you'd expect from BioWare. But the ending? It's the epitome of a deus ex machina plot mechanic. It is random, incomplete, invalidates your choices throughout the entire series by throwing three incoherent and indeterminate ""choices"" at you and then nothing. Everything you've done, everything you've looked forward to turned completely meaningless. The questions that need to be asked: Was this deliberately done by BioWare with the intention of selling post-launch ""proper ending"" DLC to us? In which case, it is a sorely underhanded sales tactic. Was this unintentional and the result of rushing to complete a game that they slapped an ending to it and hoped nobody would notice? In which case, shoddy development shows the true state of what BioWare has become. Either way, the disappointment remains. The damage is done and for me, someone who used to laud the ground BioWare walked on, I will always be cautious of any and every BioWare game from now on.

The minute you head for the point of no return, the games plot and logic fall apart, culminating in a confusing nonsensical ending that resolves nothing. The ending of the game damages more than just this game, but the previous two titles as well. You are left with complete and utter disappointment that also ruins the replay value of these games.

jessejplatt,"They really have been dumbing this game down since the first ME. I didn't really mind it because I actually really enjoyed the story and getting to know all the characters and spending hours learning back story and molding my story how I wanted. However the ""ending"" of the series really bothered me. It just plain out ****. I've read all the theories behind why it was the way it was but it still doesn't explain why I get an ending that I have no say in. I can go through the 3rd game literally just do the story arc and get the same ending as someone who has played through all 3 games making all the big decisions and putting their time in to get to know the whole background of other characters. So many plot holes and unanswered questions. I literally would've given this game a 10 if not for the ending. The ending really ruined this game for me that I don't even want to go back and play the multiplayer. Which is actually decent in my opinion. It just bothers me to think about it. Bioware has really left a bad taste in my mouth. I can kind of forgive them for what they did to Dragon Age, but what they did to ME, no. Been a fan of the company since Neverwinter Nights and thought they could do no wrong, but this was the final straw. On a side note to people saying ""quit whining it's their game and can do what they want, you just want a stupid happy ending!"" No. Just no. I wanted a game like Bioware promised where my choices actually made a difference. Instead of them abandoning all the idea and themes from the first two games and forcing me a **** ending. I wouldn't mind a happy or sad ending. I just want a good ending with some closure and not huge plot holes. It is their game but they owe to the fans to deliver what we want.

CoyoteLovely,"Like everyone else, I loved the game - and hated the ending. I would say that the unfortunate thing is that five minutes of ending have made me question keeping the games. I think fondly back on months of talking with my friends about what the ending would be - only to really have it make no difference. Its stunning really, how quickly the game turns south too... it goes from being a game of loss, and battle, and trudging through the war, praying that the answers get easier at the next turn.... And then, the last five minutes, where nothing makes sense, and all the endings are (for all intents and purposes) exactly the same. Buy it, don't buy it. Be aware that the game itself is magnificent - but there's this underlying feeling that some pencil pusher asked the dev team where they were with the game, and the Dev Team said ""We've got everything done but the last hour of the game. We're at this weird place in the Citadel right before the final battle."" And the pencil pusher said ""You've got two days, wrap it up, and ship it - whatever it is. We'll fix it with DLC."" My further impression of this is how very short the game was. As a comparison - I picked up Mass Effect 2 about a week before Mass Effect 3 was released, and I only got about a third of the way through the game in that week (this is with knowing EXACTLY where everything was, and exactly how to complete all the missions - there was no fumbling or wasting time). I'm done with Mass Effect 3, finished it on Monday, having put in a very similar block of time - and that would mark day 6 of my ownership of the game. Ultimately, I'm part of the outraged many. I had problems with EA's Origin system, and getting a preorder from them - but I didn't let that deter me. I just ordered it from Best Buy instead... I was a defender of Bioware when the DLC scandal came up. But the ending? I feel like an abused girlfriend at this point. Seriously, play the game - but at the moment where you're about to beam up to the Citadel, turn off your console, put down your controller, and go write fan fiction of what your ending should be. It will be more satisfying.",4,2012-03-14,PC,user

I played the first two games and thoroughly enjoyed them, the feeling of my decisions making a difference to the outcome of the overall story was great. I was also thoroughly enjoying watching the final story unfold - even with, lets not kid, the lack of proper dialogue between missions and lack of dialogue options with characters and random civilians (a real step back from what the ME series is about, UNFORGIVABLE!! Those side quests were horrendous, listening in for them? Absolutely no involvement. Just like a couple of the quests from ME2 on Illium.) and the lack of armor and armor mods/weapons mods etc featured in the first game which were 'to come back'. I would have given the game a 7 at this point. And then I got to the ending. What a pile of horse manuere! It went aggainst everything we were promised. The decisions made in the first and second game meant absolutely nothing to how the finale played out and were quite minimal to how the mid-game played out, instead of an unforgettable climactic satisfying ending we got ""DOOR ABC, YOUR CHOICES DON'T MEAN ANYTHING TO ME"" rubbish.

elysalol,"First, I have to say that I have never been more disappointed in a video game. Honestly, after I beat the game to see that they all differed only by the color of the leaves, I regret wasting $60 on it. Unfortunately, I bought the PC version, and I couldn't even trade it back in. Mass Effect wasn't a mediocre game: it was legendary. It stressed choice and consequence, shaping a galaxy through the choices you, as the player, made. I played the first two, and absolutely adored them. The storyline was unique, cutting-edge. The characters and the relationships formed between companions and crew members were realistic and brilliant. I recommended the games to everyone I knew. Now, I'm telling trying to tell everyone not to waste their money. The weak storyline of the third game could have probably been overlooked if it was followed by the truly epic endings everyone expected. Unfortunately, the endings were the complete opposite. Thinking about how much time I wasted on this game makes me sick. I completely agree with most of the reviewers here: the story in the third game was weak and completely lacking; character interactions were minimal and disappointing; there were HUGE plot holes, and even the cutscenes were bad. I'm sorry, but last time I checked this was Mass Effect, not a Battlestar Galactica rip off. And the shiny Reaper child made from The Force? Give me a break. I really, really regret buying this game and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Play the first two and make up your own ending; it's sure to be LOADS better than Bioware's.",0,2012-03-14,PC,user
spitfiremk87,"Spoilers below. I have played all 3 of the series over the span of 5 years. I have invested countless time and effort into my character and the universe. I really enjoyed this last game in the series. It brought elements from the first and second games together nicely. It also had some of the best storytelling in just about any game I've seen. BUT As you may heard about the endings. They are HORRIBLE. Plot holes galore, your choices never mattered and they literally detract from the series after you've played them. Nothing is ever explained in the endings at all. As far as multiple endings are concerned, there are basically three choices that coincide with almost the exact same CG sequence at the end, with the only difference being the color of explosions you get. I hope that Bioware will show their fans some respect and fix the endings or add to them in some way. The Mass Effect series did not deserve this ending.",10,2012-03-14,PC,user
Cordelayne,"I signed up at metacritic just to write this review. It's awful that metacritic gives this game a 93 rating on some top screens, based on the reviews of 13 ""critics."" The spread here between a 9.3 critic score and a 3.6 user score is the largest I've ever seen. This game is the most annoying game I've ever seen. I'm going to this trouble because I absolutely loved Mass Effect 1 and 2, and I was really pumped for 3. But 3 is a DISASTER! 1. Paid $50 for store version plus $25 for game guide. I can't return it because I wrote my Origin password on the insert with the validation code. The game guide got a cracked spine the first time I opened it! Low quality all the way. 2. I'm a sophisticated computer game player and computer programmer, with more than 25 years of experience. This darned game took me 2.5 hours to install! All kinds of problems. 3. I was so beat down after that, I punted after about 15 minutes. I just didn't like the feel of the initial sequence. 4. The game expects you to buy DLC content concerning a critical element of the game (the precursor aliens) right off the bat! The DLC was promoted the day the game was released! That is incredibly greedy and stupid. I never buy DLC unless I really like a game AND have finished what I bought at high price. 5. The Origin intermediary program is insane! Having selected an option at some point during the install to have this automatically start when I reboot my computer, there is no way to turn it off. 6. The game is almost impossible to run. After getting a successful install, off the $50 of DVDs I purchased, it takes 15 minutes or more to start the game! You can't just play the game you bought. You have to have Origin running (Electronic Arts's version of Steam) and it takes forever for it to log on and validate your password. Then, after the game loads, it doesn't start until it logs onto separate Electronic Arts servers. That can take more than 30 minutes!!!!! In my case this morning, it took about 8 minutes, but I've seen people complaining that at high-volume periods like Saturday night it can take more than 30 minutes. What in the heck is up with that??? Why do I need to be logged onto EA at all to play the game I just bought!!!??? 7. After a full install, it is impossible to run the game offline. Most civilized systems permit this. For example, I bought Skyrim in November and was able to run it for four months offline of Steam, after getting the initial patch. Origin is a very stupid program. 8. I'm on a crappy satellite Internet location in a rural location, and the Internet connection goes down rather regularly during rough weather. But I can't play Mass Effect 3 during bad weather. That ****. I paid $75 to buy the game and the game guide. I should be able to play it offline! (And I should be able to play it on a laptop during travel, etc.) 9. When I tried to start the game this morning, Origin insisted I had to install a 16 GB update!!! WTF? I just bought the game with physical DVDs a few days ago. No way is such a patch required. The stupid Origin program obviously thinks I need to download the entire darned game, even though I've already got it installed! By the by, on my Hughes satellite Internet connection, if I did a download like that, it would knock me off the Internet for a couple of days. 10. Finally, in the ever-growing list of fantastic aggravations, I learn from the manual and the initial game screens that I start out with all of my ""war assets"" in the ""galactic war"" set at 50%. That means ALL of the essential allies I am gathered are gimped to one-half. The ONLY ways that can be upgraded is to start with an end-game save from Mass Effect 2, or to play many, many hours of mulitiplayer combats. Well, I can't import a Mass Effect 2 save, because the computer I was using for that was destroyed by a particularly virulent virus. And I don't want to play multiplayer combat exercises, and I couldn't do it even if I wanted to, due to my current crappy and laggy satellite Internet connection. So, in other words, this crappy game, after collecting so much money, forces me to have such inferior troops that it may be impossible to win the game. ************* I'm VERY sore about this! I feel VERY ripped off and abused by a greedy and stupid company.",0,2012-03-14,PC,user
coloradosarge,"I thought the game was awesome up until the end. I hating the ending and I think BW can do much better. That said, the triology was still one of the most awesome gaming experiences that I've ever had and will be much better if they change the ending. While I think the real score I would rate this is about a 7 or 8 I am giving it a 10 based on the rest of the game and previous games and to try and offset the other people trolling on here that are obviously marking the score low because of the ending.

Bandicool,"I really don't know what went wrong but those endings and their consequences must be the biggest letdown i've ever experienced in gaming history. The game (without the 10 mins in the ending) deserves a 9/10 but the ending is so horribly full of plot-holes and unansweread questions that I am left speechless. In a game where the story and it's characters are the main reason for buying it, how can you end it like this?",4,2012-03-14,PC,user
Greggor,"I am giving this game a 7 instead of a 10 because of the ending. We were promised 14 different endings, tailored to your character archetype, how you played the game, and the decisions you made. Instead, we got two different endings. You can win, or you can lose. This depends only on whether or not you have completed enough missions by the end of the game. If you win, you can very slightly alter the end-cinematic depending on the choice you make after the final battle. Your decision, however, has no impact on the story, and everything that you did in the game is basically invalidated by this frustrating conclusion. It's a highly disappointing end to the series, which is why so many people are upset about it. Now that the bad stuff's out of the way, let's move on to the good. The game was very fun. I beat it in three days, and I slept only a few hours each night because I simply couldn't put the game away. The story was extremely captivating, the combat was really visceral, and the dialogue was fascinating as always. This game does credit to its predecessors, which were also paragons of the shooter RPG subgenre. It's a real shame that they ended the series on such a terrible note, but that doesn't detract completely from the game's other virtues. It was fun, and I have no trouble recommending it to friends.",7,2012-03-14,PC,user
JonChanger,"This games ending was a major disappointment. Everything was great up until the all choice, freewill, and consequence were taken away from the player in the final moments. If it weren't for the ending I would easily give this game a 9/10. However, the ending was so terrible that I (almost) wish I could unplay all of the other games and never had wasted time on them. I felt similarly when lost ended but at least I could respect it was not my decision. In this case, Bioware led the players to believe the ending was our decision (through the choices we made in the game). Apparently, not... I sincerely hope that Bioware adds additional post-game content in upcoming DLCs to make sense of this pointless ending.",2,2012-03-14,PC,user
TotalBiscuitXXX,"A forgettable experience! From its copy and paste level & characters its copy and paste waves of enemies, frustrating controls over its run and cover system (binded to space on PC). Its like EA/Bioware forced the Devs to design multiplayer, kinect and dlc instead! Mass Effect 3 leave you with a real hunger for a more then lackluster experience. The trouble with this game steams from its re-write, and I'm guessing corporate or hierarchical interference overwhelming common sense and appealing for a money grab. Was a shameful display I was really looking forward for Mass Effect 3 but I had my hopes dashed when I first read about the script leak last year!",0,2012-03-14,PC,user

Alesv88,Mass Effect is in my opinion one of the best games ever. The first game I finished at least 4 times but the second I finished more than 8 times. Mass Effect 3 gives me no desire to re-play it again unless Bioware change the ending that I think is a complete sh@t. I hate it and hate Bioware to destroy what for me was the best game ever. I will not buy any Bioware game anymore.,3,2012-03-14,PC,user
ceppi,"After DA2 and SWTOR, I was really scared that Mass Effect 3 would be really bad, and oh boy, was I right... First of all, you are forced to play multiplayer or most probably you get the bad ending. This is a problem now, but in 3-4 months, when people stop playing multiplayer, its going to be an even worse situation. Second of all, the goddamn first day DLC, when its already present of the disc I goddamn buyed few days ago, and Bioware lying about it just makes things worse. Overall I am just disappointed, I will most likely will not check the next Bioware game even tho it was one my favorite gaming companies...

But the end simply didn't work for a story with so much personal investment in the trilogy.

Piapia,"Never has a game dropped the ball so INCREDIBLY; it is beautifully wrought and so well done that you will overlook many of the plot holes it does have and a lot of the laziness that went into the game; from BioWare's use of stock images to well over a hundred graphical and audio errors and various glitches that will sometimes even make your quest bug out and you can't finish it. Errors with importing save games an inability to even transfer your custom faces over... so many things wrong, but the visceral gameplay and climactic build-up of the game, the choices and the story, well... you' be willing to overlook it... almost. You might have cringed at times and facepalmed at others but chances were, you'd still enjoy it and still had a good game. But the ending... dear GODS... BioWare lied on every front; nothing they promised for endings are there. The ultimate tale of Shepard concludes with you losing to the Reapers regardless of how well you fought, and having spent an entire game building a fleet you never get to see in action, ending on a note that essentially says, ""Yeah, we're going to make more games because we're sure you'll pay for it."" With content cut from the game so it could be sold at day one, them finishing the game early enough so you could actually download it before release (as I did) if you pre-ordered but STILL having a host of technical issues... and an ending that would have fit better in an obscure Japanese Anime (and has been known to make fans of that genre just as mad anyway; check out Neon Genesis Evangelion for a reference example) the game has literally dropped the ball on all marks and BioWare has fumbled their chance to make history (beyond being the butt of what will likely be a long standing joke). If you were looking for something to finally dethrone the CoD franchise or Halo or other gaming giants, this game is NOT your champion. And if you DO like those games? Better you stick to them and avoid ME3.",3,2012-03-14,PC,user
Vic,"I give this game 9/10 Good: Awesome story, memorable characters, great ending (completes the story, no cliffhangers, !watch the credits there's a scene after it!), awesome soundtrack, one of the best combat systems, the game is very cinematic which is a strong side of it! Bad: Graphics (no any improvement since the last game low resolution textures just break the whole immersion, I guess that's because when they try to please console gamers, whose pulling the whole industry down with their almost 10 years old machines), the story seems short if you ignore all that stupid Citadel side quests (not considering N7 missions which were pretty cool), day one DLC (what the f**k), the whole game lacks of innovations (nothing new in the gameplay just some minor tweaks, if it wasn't the last in the series I'd give it much lower score), some minor bugs.

svladimir,"My first rating was 2. It's almost 6am now, I've just finished the game and changing rating to 10. Why it was 2 in the first place ? 1) the game mechanics is different from the first and second games, I was just expected it to be the same 2) the game was really slow, a bit frustrating, in the beginning 3) clumsy animation sometimes 4) reduced dialog options 5) quite often it's somewhat hard to draw the parallel between a dialog option and what a personage actually says 6) the game is much less RPG than the first 2 games. And why I am changing it to 9 ? 1) it's another game and if to decide for yourself that it's not a true RPG and rather an amazing huge sci-fi story you can be a part of - it plays so well ! 2) while a bit slow in the beginning the game starts rolling towards the end, during last 10 hours (yes, non stop) of the game I could hardly find time to go to toilet :) 3) I TOTALLY love the ending. This is how a BIG saga shall end. Yes it's not truly RPG when all your heroes count etc... but again, the game itself is not a true RPG game. And I really like the story ! It's all explained so well, I didn't hesitate making my last choice and very satisfied with it, this is the only way how it should be, I think. 10 out of 10, easy. Thanks BioWare for an amazing experience.",10,2012-03-14,PC,user

pavi132,"The combat was pretty fun, the multiplayer started fun but got repetitive since it is entirely co-op horde mode and there was no competitive multiplayer. The story had a few strong moments. Never in my life did I think that just the ending of a piece of entertainment could retroactively destroy the positive experiences I had with that piece of entertainment. Mass Effect 3 managed to do just that. I had heard the ending was bad before I even started the game, but I wrote this off as only a few people who were very vocal, and believed that I would enjoy the ending when I got to it. I was completely mistaken. The ending not only made no sense, but it took away any possibility for the player to make a significant choice, and made the player feel like all the choices made up until this point of the game were utterly worthless and had no impact on the game whatsoever. It left me feeling incomplete, as if the reapers were never defeated and the Mass Effect series never really got an end. It caused me to immediately uninstall the game and not even think about playing through the game again, which I was originally planning on doing. I didn't think it was possible, but this game single-handedly in the last 10 minutes or so, ruined my love for the Mass Effect series and Bioware. It was a disappointment and what could have been a terrific game was ruined because of it.",2,2012-03-14,PC,user

h0bb1t,"I get where people are coming from with the hate, but it's not about the ending, it's about the journey. And as a game ME3 is a really one thing apart. The missions are varied, the characters are (once again) solid. There are really memorable missions, and some moments that would evoke some man-tears. Bioware manages to create some epic scenes, which surpasses everything you've seen in ME2. (The battle for the Citadel was still the best moment in the entire series in my opinion.) If you loved ME1, and liked ME2, you surely will enjoy at least ME3. The ending is probably entirely different from what you might expect; it lacks closure. Yes, there are some plotholes in the final hour of the game. But it's still a solid gold game. The characters I've grown fond of my not have said their goodbyes to me in a way i would like, and in the end, all your choices don't really matter to anyone, except for when ME4 comes out.",8,2012-03-14,PC,user

Tata,"Updated Review: I saw the warnings here about the ending, so I thought I should be prepared for a really bad ending, but you can't prepare for this. It was much worse than I thought It would be. And people said that Witcher 2 had a bad ending (which I couldn't understand because I thought It was great). Well, atleast other parts of the game were from good to mediocre. The new characters are pretty good, with few exception. I was actually surprised that James is an actually great character, because I expected him to be flat. The combat is more like Witcher 2 with the rolling and finishing moves (which is a good thing!), if only it's a bit too easy on Insanity, but It's still affected by the bugs from Mass Effect 2 like ling of sight shooting, getting stuck or character not doing what you want (do 100 things with one button is not a good idea). The romance, well.. My romance option was Liara, and the first half of her romance was disastrous, but the second was very good. Note that I'm not homophobic or anything, but there is no way to detest or condemn a character that is gay, lesbian or not. Again, I don't have anything against homosexuality, but there is no choice given to you about this, unlike in Dragon Age where you could decide how you approach something like this, and here's another problem. Lack of choice. The paragon and renegade meter is finally mixed, but only like 1% of the dialogues have a middle option, making that pointless. The interrupts were most of the times, good. The cutscenes: A lot of them are good, but then, a lot of them is unnecessary, especially at the beginning of the game. There's also a lot of time where you can't interrupt the dialogue or the cutscene, hindering the replay value. There are also serious problems with smoke effects, as It can make even the best computers lag like hell. The character animations are probably the worst I've ever seen. There is a part where you have the option to hug a friend, but because of bad animation, you end up hugging the air. Really? The graphics are mostly good, but the background is a train-wreck. If you pay attention to the background, you can see a lot of low-res textures, or even immobile people, even if they are about to step, making them look like statues. While I had high expectation with this game, It's far from that, but still, It's much better than Dragon Age 2. My advice: Prepare for the worst ending you can possibly imagine (or you wouldn't dare to even imagine).",5,2012-03-14,PC,user

Shermos,"I really enjoyed Mass Effect. It's by far the best out of the series in my judgement. I'll start off with my problems with it because they are only few and minor. The biggest one being the space button for cover and running... It takes a bit of getting used to. My Shep died a few times because he took cover instead of running away from a blood thirsty husk. The second one is the subtitles, they are a bit small to read from a distance which is for people who don't have English as their first language. Lastly, the running animations. They look a bit ridiculous, but are okay once you get used to them. Mass effect was never about the game play for me anyway. The face importing issue is a real let down, but don't worry too much about this, Bioware have promised to get a fix out ASAP. Make your first play through a new game instead of an import and by the time you're ready to do an import for your second game, the issue will likely be worked out. Now to what I liked. The plot and characters were both really good, and that includes the endings which a lot of people seem to hate. Without spoiling the game, Shepard's story ends, but there isn't complete closure. Some questions are left open to be answered in a future Mass Effect game. You're left to imagine what might happen and look forward to whatever Bioware comes up with next. The game is also much funnier and more emotional than the previous games. I almost got a bit teary in places. The writers did a really good job at making players invest emotions into the characters and races of the universe. To some up, please please, please ignore any rating which goes below 5 or 6.

However, since finishing the game I now understand why, either the critics have been bribed or they have no seen the absolute mess of an ending. The only reason I give this a 5 and not a 1 is because up until the end the game is all I imagined it would be; it contained rich flowing story and dialog with a very sound game engine. Some people complain about the poor textures and some of the animations but I am fine with that, I don't play the mass effect trilogy for the graphical detail, I play it for the in depth interactive story. The negativity of this review is based solely on the ending, which is very vague, full of plot holes and just generally not a ""mass effect"" ending.

The story is so well written that during the game the main story effected my decisions drastically. Where i normally choose for a peaceful and ""good"" solution, now i did not hesitate to do evil just for the greater good. ME3 had convinced me that the menace of the reapers was so immense that i decided to eliminate entire species. The convinced threat made me decide to even shoot a friend and old teammate in the back just for the greater good. This convinced me that even in real life there is a devil in everybody if the circumstances are that way. The story is so great that you expect a grand final. You live up to this moment. I even cancelled all my appointments when i started the last and final chapter. This was it. I made some terrible decisions just to get ready for this moment. My expectations of this end was huge. ... Then i started to play the final mission. It started good but after a while the story ended in a way i totally not expected. Suddenly i had a choice of 3 options where non of them where satisfying referring to the epic intro of the first missions. It felt like there was no more budget to end this game properly. When i tell bedtime story's to my children and i want to finish it fast i say in dutch: dan een olifant met een dikke snuit blaast het verhaaltje uit. In english this means ""then an elephant comes with a big snout and blows away the story"". I had the exact same feeling with this end. It felt like there was no more time to end it properly. The gap between the high expectations before the last mission and the final end was so big for me, that i had the same emotions like most of the people who graded this game here. I was so disappointed. I could not believe that such a good story and overall game(s) ended this way. It took me a few days of setting aside my disappointment to look at the game objectively. This all says 2 things in my opinion. ME 3 is such a good game with a great story, it moves you and makes you think about real life decisions. However, because this game is so good you expect something extraordinary for a final. And in this last part i think ME3 completely failed. This effects the overall opinion of the game so much that most of the loyal fans of ME judge the game so badly. Just because of this bad ( or to psychologically difficult) ending. I probably graded ME3 with a 2 or 3 myself the first days, now i think ME3 is a victim of its own quality. If you are good, there is no place for errors. At least not if this magnitude.",6,2012-03-14,PC,user

Fedaykinn,"SO I finally finished the game. It is a GREAT game... I see many complains about little things people don't like... but I loved it. I won't spoil the ending, but all I have to say is that it does make a lot of sense and it is pretty good. Granted we would all like to see an ending tailored to every single decission we have made, but thats not the way things work. In ME3, as with life, you don't get to choose the ending you consider to be the perfect one... what you get to choose is how to get to that ending. It is a Journey and not a destination. The trilogy does progress into less RPG and more combat as it goes along, but it makes sense given the story. I can't help but feel a little sad that it is over. I fully recomend this game to anyone, but specially to those who have played the first two and loved them... and are also mature enough to realize that you can't always get what you want in life, but you must enjoy every minute of it. That is ME3.",9,2012-03-14,PC,user

Fans of the first two games who import their characters will be dissapointed in the endings especially compared with the previous two installments.

iN7,"Epic..astonishing..breath-taking..classic - these could`ve been words describing Mass Effect 3. Yet different words come to mind after you see the final scene and start to read credits. Below you will learn why. 1. Plot Weak at some points, strong in others, total failure by the end. It`s worst parts are these: the starting mission on Earth - Shepard`s totally confused by people running around and has no clue of what`s going on, yet seconds later is asked by the Commettee about ""what`s going on"" and ""how do we stop them"". Shepard`s been locked in his room, had limited contacts, but just one short look on an iPad - and he`s got the answer. Guess it was just written on the Pad`s screen - "" The Rippers are here (tragic voice)"". Second worst part of the plot - it`s ending. But let`s make it clear: bad ending when Shepard dies is Ok. It fits the situation. But three bad endings is just too much. Shepard deserves good ending too, he deserves to live. His adventures, his decisions, his relations with different persons - it wasn`t always about death and violence. It was also about love, passion, friendship and honor - things that so many people lack these days. And Bioware seems to ignore their value as well, there`s no reward for being good by the end of the game. 2. Graphics It`s worse that in ME2. Just install ME2 and you`ll notice the difference at once. ME3 uses the same engine, yet textures are low-res on most objects, except faces. Shadows are totally messed up, they look terrible and tend to disappear from time to time. There`s no ""film-grain"" effect which was the game`s feature before. Plus the **** eyes get red in pain every time I see Shepard charging, it`s the worst running animation I`ve seen in years. Face mimic became weaker too. But again, things were Ok in ME2, so God knows why Bioware ruined the animation part. Got bored with perfection ? 3. Sound/Music Sounds are there and are well-made, no doubt about it. Ambient sounds fit locations rather well. Music is on an average level, you will hardly remember most tracks, yet the one named ""An end once and for all"" is touching. This part of the game is mostly fine. 4. Multiplayer One word - boring. It`s hardly a Mass Effect experience, just a tribute to modern tradition adding multiplayer wherever possible.Here it`s just a silly feature, which is supposed to give you certain benefits in the single-player part of the game. And it`s not interesting. Conclusion: The worst part of the trilogy both technically and story-wise. And it`s really hard for me as a fan to write such words. Mass Effect is the universe with GREAT potential. It may become ""Star Wars"" of the 21st century. Yet it may not.. Bioware must re-think its attitude to this franchise. And stop destroying its own great creation by bad scripts, bad visuals and predator marketing. Bioware must remember, that games are made for players and players have their voice. Some game journalists while protecting the quality of ME3 say, that "" this is Bioware`s game, don`t tell them what and how to do"". It may be their game, yet they want US to play it and pay OUR money. So we,as customers and fans, deserve quality product as a sign of respect and good will. Don`t we, Bioware?",4,2012-03-13,PC,user
icedemonofozz,This game presents ideas about the singularity and a post human future in an approachable way. The story is affecting if you have bothered to invest time in the personal relationships. Playing this game was personally affecting. The ending which so many are complaining about was philosophically and intellectually satisfying. The lack of choice in this game is not a negative because without the restrictions that brings there can be no meaningful narrative. I like this game.,10,2012-03-13,PC,user
paynesgray,"It was the best game I'd ever played, since Pong, but frankly the ending boiled down to Choose Your Own Adventure ""Pick a color. All rails lead to Page 37"" ruined the game as well as killing the replayability of ME1 and 2 for me. Why bother making a new Shep, with new decisions, if it's all running to one of three railroad tracks? All the Twitter teases about ""if you knew what was coming you'd save your copy forever"" don't mean much to me. I rate the game by what's on my computer, not what hypothetical DLC that might come later. Many players are also concerned that the 3 endings are a scam to leave players needing to ""buy the rest of the ending"" in a DLC. If a free DLC comes out that finishes the game logically and in a way that my choices and accomplishments matter again, then I'll change my review.",0,2012-03-13,PC,user

passer_by,"Mass Effect series is a story heavy game. The ending of the story of Mass Effect had so many things wrong with it that you will wish you never played it to begin with. If you are looking for a shooter, there are much more decent games out there than this anyway. The only reason to buy this, which is the story is unfortunately lacking in ME3. Couple this together with the fact that developers were selling day 1 DLC for $10 which apparently they worked on after the main game was finished. They should have spent that time making a logically coherent ending. As good as every other story element was in the game, all of it is unraveled by a bizarre ending that renders every choice made till then meaningless.

If you are a fan of the games, you will not be a fan of this game. The way in which Bioware handle's your past experiences with the game is insulting. Without giving spoilers, I will say that absolutely nothing you do matters. What is worse, Bioware and its sponor IGN has been extremely insulting to its fan base to such a degree I cannot in good conscience give this game a good review.

CursedFeanor,"Be very careful about trusting the reviews of most users here, you might otherwise pass up on one of the best game of all time in Mass Effect 3. For the record, I have just completed the whole game (in about 42 hours of gameplay to do all the side-quests and something like 5 hours of multiplayer). I have played countless games in my life, but very few, if any, have made me actually ""feel"" more intense and diverse emotions than the Mass Effect series (I've played all 3, passing along my save file all the way, no problem). You get attached to basically every of the characters and care about what's going to happen to them and their respective races and civilizations. You still get presented with incredibly hard decisions to make if you let yourself get immersed as you should. The combat system is awesome, balanced and fun! The music is gorgeous throughout and so are all the sound-effects and dialogs. I have not encountered any significant bug that would be noteworthy (don't trust the haters). Honestly, I would be hard-pressed to find any negative points about this game, hence the 10/10.

Inzomniac9,"When I look back at the mass effect trilogy, I really can't see it in a positive light anymore after the terrible ending. This is not about the actual details of the story, for that is Bioware's vision and they can do what they want with their own story. The real reason that this ending is so horrible, enough to ruin this game for me, is broken up into two main reasons. Without spoilers: First, the ending does not provide any real closure. In my opinion, as the conclusion to a trilogy that many played 100+ hours of between the three games, ME3 really should at least provide an actual conclusion no matter how the story goes. Even just an epilogue of just text (Which would be really simple to do and something Bioware has done in many previous games) would be sufficient, but the fact that I left this ""conclusion to the trilogy"" with more question than I started with was really disappointing. (1 ending really)) Finally, and most importantly, the main reason for the ending really ruining the series for me is that none of the choices from previous games matter. Mass effect has always been about having the player create their own story through a multitude of decisions and choices that are given to the player over the course of 100+ hours. This was a main strength of the series, and really drew many people to it. On top of that, the wonderful relationships the player makes with the many amazing(personality-filled) characters of the series just adds to the lasting appeal of Mass Effect. However, all of this is essentially thrown away with the ending, for none of those relationships and choices really mattered at all, which is BS and very disappointing. On top of this, there is essentially one ending, with the only differences really being superficial changes that mean very little. Overall, Mass effect 3 was the most disappointing game I have ever played because the story is basically ruined at,sadly, the very end. I am not denying the amazing moments this game has (I even felt like crying at one great scene) but the ending makes it not really matter(hence the low rating. With the story ruined it is hard to look back on ME3 with a positive light, for, lets be honest, the story is Mass effect's main appeal.",1,2012-03-13,PC,user

aznrap1st,"This was supposed to be the game that completes the mass effect series and gave closure to its loyal fans. Instead, this game was dumbed down to the levels of COD. Mass effect 3 focused more on shaking screens and big explosions than good story/gameplay. Through the whole thing, while we still had choices to make, it felt like my hand was being held between the times we could make choices in dialogue. The world was also disappointing. The normandy got smaller with fewer interactable characters and objects, and so did the citadel. There was less time spent exploring new places. When shopping for weapons, you don't see the specs of the weapons in the shop compared to the weapons you already own. You'll have to buy the weapons to see how it stacks up against what you already have. And like the others have said, the biggest screw up is that the choices that you make during me1, me2, and me3 don't matter in the end.

Playing in 3D is dreadful and the movement options and the way Shepherd jerks (that says a lot) around is like turning the clock back ten years in gaming. How did it ever get the 9 and 10's score. I would give it an ambitious 1. I know very litte about what's happening at EA, but I do know that when I spend Â£34.99 I expect to get value for money. I can't comment on the content or story line, and this is my first and only experieince with Mass Effect, as I have dumped it after playing the first ten minutes. A waste of money.

The missions was to shooter like with no real dialogs and explorations of area, that is OK for the side missions, but I had hoped for the main missions to be more like ME1. It was to short as well, took me 36 hours to complete(the first 2 spend around 60 hours pre-DLC), to bad they didn't spend the resources from the multi player part to put the final touch on the single player game. I wont comment on the multi player part. I haven't played it and have no intentions to do it Then I hit the ending of the game and my mass effect world crumbled to dust.

I do however, agree that this was not the best game in the series for the story. It is however a great game overall from the amount of fun I've had playing through it. The action was intense, the story wasn't the greatest but I still enjoyed it, and of course they always fixed the problems with the last game, so overall Mass Effect 3 is a solid shooter RPG and still an essential game to the series. They may have made choice making less noticeable of importance, and of course focused more on the combat rather than the love of the story, which I believe was a big mistake. However, I still enjoyed the game very much and feel that I've gotten a good game for my money. They could have improved on the story, choice making, and of course not done a half ass job on the ending. Though I have to say if anything, this game deserves to be in the green.

I really wish BioWare could have provided some sort of effect for what you had done, and closure for the characters you'd grown to love. Nothing you do matters even a bit in the end. Everything you do in the series was building up to that and to have it limited to a choice of 3 cutscenes with no consideration of what had happened before.

This game also has great voice overs . I'm my opinion it's one of the best games to make the characters seem human with all the interaction you get . This review is my personal thoughts on this game.

I honestly thought the game was fantastic throughout, and although i wasn't completely satisfied with the ending, i thought it was a very interesting and unique way to end the series. If that's what they were still planning on doing with this game. that being said, im still not sure which one i like the most out of the series. while the last game was great, this one has so much more life to it. the characters, your squadmates, they feel real to interact with. i remember in the last game, each one would simply stay in their designated areas, not moving, and only talking to you when you engaged in a conversation. now they all do there own thing. they interact with the other characters and there environment even while your not around. they even leave the ship with you when you go to the citidel to explore it for themselves. this also carrys over into combat as well, infact combat is so much more improved than the last game, it makes the last two feel sad in comparison. you can now perform many new maneuvers, and the cover system is greatly improved. the enemies are also much smarter and will now even work out ways to flank you and split your squad up. probably my favorite part about mass effect 3, is the story, obviously. everything is written so well, and is so believable, it makes me wonder how they got the game finnished, even by the date it was released. i mean yes, there are a lot of bugs, but when the game is such a large scale, you come to expect them. although i still wish they would have checked the game more thoroughly. i also keep hearing people complain about the romance options almost as much as the ending which is strange because it really isnt that different from the last 2 titles in the series. but im really not very sure of how its changed, because i didnt actually romance anyone in my first playthrough. it was an accident, somehow.",10,2012-03-13,PC,user
Anferny159,"I registered simply to put perspective on the rampant INTJ and pseudo-nerd-computer-hugging personalities that have absolutely infected this review page. Mass Effect 3 is not only the strongest game in the series, but also the most thoroughly put together. It, unlike 1 and to a lesser extent 2, is incredibly streamlined and much deeper as a result. The vast majority of negative opinion seems to revolve around the ending of the series. That being said, anyone with a brain can assume that hours 1-25+ of Mass Effect 3 will enjoy one of the most incredible experiences a video game can offer. Now, ignoring spoilers, the ending is fantastic. It's reception has, so far, been very similar to that of the TV series Lost. A show which drew people in with it's cool Sci-Fi mysteries, but actually MATTERED because of it's human content and ambiguous sense of good and evil. Mass Effect ends in much the same way. If you truly think about it all, the series could not have ended effectively otherwise. The whole series wasn't about choice, but the implications of fate versus freedom and consequences of our decisions. These are HUGE existential question for a video game to approach. I CAN and will say, with almost 100 percent certainty, that the backlash originates from a socially inept and ridiculously over invested group of computer geeks. There simply is no other way to put it. If the kids/ gamers that rated this game anything less than a 7 would have written the ending, be it collaboratively or otherwise, it would have been a **** technical-filled-SciFi-Channel-Uber-Geek nightmare with no sense of poetic understanding. I seriously called this sort of ending from game 1. The tone for it has always been there, but unfortunately the personality types of most **** from-the""mars""-series-of-books prevent any sort of large scale understanding of what the game is about. Don't deprive yourself. Play the finale and enjoy this great game.",10,2012-03-13,PC,user
ToRrRrR,"The Good: Character interaction, fun combat, enjoyable story (until the end), stable game, very quick loading. The Bad: Low resolution textures, No FOV slider, No Xbox 360 controller support, Day one DLC. I enjoyed playing the game, until the awful ending. Basically all the difficult choices you made in ME 1 & 2 do not impact how the third game ends. As if this wasn't bad enough, when you've watched the credits a cheeky message appears saying you can expect lots more DLC. Day one DLC is awful, especially when it affects the single player experience. Bioware/EA spent three months creating this money making scheme, if only they had focused their efforts on including higher resolution textures, gamepad support and an FOV slider.

The ending though is something else, unfitting, bad written, plot holed, ...

Jdund117,"I preordered this game. I got it, started playing it, and within about an 2 hours of playing it I was satisfied. Bioware streamlined and improved every system, including missions (although some were hard to do because they weren't on the galaxy map), and they brought back the Citadel with a number of new really cool areas to check out. Dialogue seemed so much more casual than it had been in the first two games, and in my opinion it was acted and animated better. Any character that was still two-dimensional after ME2 was made three-dimensional, and every character that was three-dimensional after ME2 was so multifaceted you could believe that they were real. For example, the whole interaction between Shepard and Garrus was just priceless. Garrus used to be just another companion in the first two games, but in Mass Effect 3 he became something like Shepard's best friend. The rest of the characters, like Tali, Ashley, and James were very well-developed. Even the Prothean squadmate had his moments. I felt like the romances in this series were also so much more real. I kept Liara as my love interest from the first game, and there was a lot more emotional talking going on than just plain sexy time at the end (that happened too, aw yeah). The plot was pretty freakin sweet, I loved the Tuchanka mission and the Rannoch mission... but man those decisions can be hard. Conversely, the end of the game was disappointing. The game led the player to believe that every choice would have its unique conclusion to the story, but that never happened. It's really sad to see something that could have been one of the greatest RPG's ever made kind of flop because the ending was lackluster. The multiplayer can be tough getting into it, especially if you fight reapers or something (don't do it, just don't) but it pays off (headshots **** yeah) and makes for a generally fun experience. This game is pretty freaking cool. The ending ****, but it's definitely worth playing again with a different experience. I don't know why people posted reviews on here the day that the game came out, because you obviously couldn't have finished the game in a single day, and if you did, you didn't pay attention and subsequently the game **** for you. So boo hoo, go play COD and keep the tissues and vaseline nearby.",10,2012-03-13,PC,user

Peturd,"I actually waited to play the game before commenting on it. I thought it was outstanding. I tried not to look at it as the game it could have been if they had of stuck with and refined the RPG elements. I would have liked that. The squeaky wheel got the grease though, and ME2 was more of a shooter. ME3 brought back a bit more RPG depth. So I'm not sure why the hate. It was an improvement as a shooter from ME1 and an improvement as an RPG from ME2. The experience was greater then the sum of it's parts. The story, individual plots within the story, the music, sound effects and voice acting were all great. The graphics weren't top notch on my PC, but it's limited by the consoles, and lower end machines. This was countered greatly by the overall aesthetic choices I've loved from the start. Some animations were a little weird. Sometimes it seems a characters hands or other things are moving just for the sake of having animation to make them seem more life like, ironically making them dip down in the uncanny valley. Overall the animations were very good though. Very visceral, and gave a great sense of impact. The animations of the powers make the game much more splashy. Others might find it a bit less boring to watch you play as compared to ME1 and ME2. Finally, the changes we have seen are a direct result of YOU, the consumer. Game makers make games. They then sell them to make money, so they can go on to make more games. Without money they have to get other jobs, and can't make the games they want. So they compromise on what they want to do with what the consumer wants to buy. This way they have money to get to make things that are 70% of their vision, and 30% what the market wants. If people had of supported Mass Effect 1 better, and bought it, they would have stayed true to it. It's not like traditional art with little monetary input needed to produce a final product. TL;DR: Haters are ridiculous. This is by far the best Mass Effect game of the three. Refined, improved, and well executed in almost all regards. Deserving of the critical acclaim it is receiving, not the petty down votes from spoiled kids.",10,2012-03-13,PC,user
Kaorimoch,"I consider myself a Mass Effect Fan having played Mass Effect 1 and Mass Effect 2 multiple times and enjoying the experience, but Mass Effect 3 irked me in many ways. 1. Origin Exclusive - To play this game, you are forced to sign up and play through the developer's portal. Since I have membership to 7 other gaming websites, signing up to an 8th makes it difficult to keep track of where all my games are registered to. 2. Multiplayer - In the game to get the best ending, you have to completely exhaust all single player missions and do some multiplayer. Some people like myself think multiplayer and RPGs don't mix. 3. The ending is completely at odds with how the entire saga played out. It has very little choice, plays like some existentialistic dream at odds with reality and gives no satisfying conclusion. It seems devoted to making some writer at Bioware smile in joy with the emotions they have inspired with the ending - the emotions of anger and disappointment it brings out in the player. I've never seen such an abrupt and jarring ending since KOTOR2. It has been universally slammed by fans whilst critics and Bioware opine that the fans have to eat it. However, the game was great with simple missions that don't take too long to complete, plot twists, great graphics and challenging combat. The romances, storylines and respect to the choices players have made in the past (except for the ending), make it a great tale. Great opening, great middle, complete let down at the end. All in all, the game seems devoted to forcefeeding its fans instead of allowing them to take their final journey with Shepard to its ultimate conclusion.

harperino,"Mass Effect has always been a hyrid of RPG & shooter. After 2 amazing games they have removed the key feature of the previous games, ability to shape who Shep is and what he says. Their idea of canon shep is like a cancer in the game as shep is regularly talking on his own, spouting opinions that aren't based on the character built over 2 games. Full decisions equates to some decisions in reality. If you like Mass Effect 2 characters you are not going to like how they are sidelining and for the main part weak storylines. I was especially disappointed in Miranda's while Legion/Mordin probably had the best. Me3 squad is lacking diversity. On the bright side the DLC character is truly amazing. If you are going to buy the game make sure you play it with Ashes to ashes dlc installed. I would have liked more proper dialogue with crew and less prerecorded chatter. The endings are truly terrible. In a game about choice all your choices matter for nothing. There's no diversity at all in the endings, just the same railroaded results with a minor aesthetic difference. As a conclusion to a trilogy it is an epic fail as evidenced by the hugely unfavourable response from players. I don't like multiplayer and especially don't like fact they've made it pretty much a necessity to get certain things happen at end.",1,2012-03-13,PC,user

caraniente,"This should be a 10 out of 10 game, and for the most part is. It provided some of the most epic moments in the series. The characters we know and love are there - those who aren't permanent squadmates often have large roles to play. The major quests are set around resolving issues that the game has been building up to - namely, the genophage and the Quarian-Geth war - and are complex multi-mission quests which leave you in awe. Most of the side missions, however, are repetitive drop-in-and-shoot-things quests - alright, but dull. There's also an inordinate amount of fetch quests consisting of walking past people talking, seeing a journal notification, and scanning a planet for something that you have no idea what it's for or why it's needed - which would matter less were the journal any good, but quests don't update to tell you you've found the item and a lot of the time I found myself wandering the citadel looking for an interaction marker to work out who I was supposed to give it to. My first major gripe - Bioware claim that ""you don't have to do multiplayer to get the best ending"". Apparently you need >5000 effective military strength to get the 'best' ending (with some caveats depending on choices). I completed every quest, scanned every system to completion, and can't even get over 4000 (I had 3500 at the ending and that wasn't sufficient for 'best'). Yes, I know there'll undoubtedly be DLC (this was done WITH 'From Ashes') but ME is at it's heart a single-player game, and I dislike being punished because I don't want to do multiplayer (I've never played the ME series for the fighting, after all!). Combat has been polished, however, and compared with the last couple of games is more difficult, though enemy progression does rapidly get predictable (oh look, husks, next it'll be cannibals/maruaders and then maybe a pair of beasts) or is 'a shedload of troops'. Enemy AI is much better, as was my squadmates - no more taking cover in open air and power usage was handled well. The dialogue system has changed slightly - no neutral options, which removes possibilities - though that's the way Bioware have been pushing this since ME2, so it wasn't surprising. Dialogue with your crew has been polished, but options removed - usually it's 'click and dialogue will play while Shep wanders around', but I do like the fact your companions talk to each other now, particularly when I walk in on Garrus and James hanging out in the kitchen swapping war stories or Joker asking Liara whether her head tentacles move. Shepard's character is also very well-developed in this - still the galactic superhero, but Bioware have managed to introduce signs of some of the stress our favourite protagonist is under by this game. Some people might not like it - I find it only makes it more real. Though one or two efforts at blatant emotional manipulation are a bit overdone. The game builds slowly but surely, so that by the time you complete the last priority mission and begin the endgame your heart is pounding and you have the feeling that this, this will be Shepard's crowning moment. You're invested on so many levels, and it's about more than just 'get these Reapers off my lawn' with a couple of subplots coming together in the endgame. And it's brilliant, until the last 10 minutes. In the last major scene and the resulting 'ending' there are over a dozen obvious, fatal errors. The ending is illogical, the reasoning behind it proven wrong in Shepard's own experience, and the ending cutscenes show things that couldn't possibly be real. I have no issue with the endings themselves, but it's disappointing to see that after the immense attention to detail in the rest of the game - and really, every little thing I'd done or dialogue option I'd picked seemed to be reflected throughout the game - all of that just fell apart in those last few minutes. With the current media attention and the 'change the ending' campaign, there's a lot of things being said about whining and people wanting a happy ending. I don't want a happy ending - actually, given that we're fighting an impossible foe and Earth is pretty much ravaged from the start, I'd be annoyed if I could make it through the game without sacrifices. Unfortunately, the ending quite simply doesn't make sense - it looks as though we're only seeing half the scenes we should. That is what brings this game down from a 9 or even 10 rating to a 7. Beyond that, I haven't been able to bring myself to play again. I played ME1 and 2, when I first got them, twice consecutively and did every side quest. In ME3, while I will play again, I don't see myself putting in the same amount of effort - and I will probably turn off the game before the final part of the ending. For a game like this to leave as its legacy something that makes you LESS likely to play through again - means something has gone wrong. And that's not the legacy ME deserves.",7,2012-03-13,PC,user

tortellini,"Gameplay is ok and fun, even if nothing really changed since 2. There are 3 groups of enemies which is all you ever fight, and they get repetitive **** biggest issue is that the resolution of the story is the worst let-down. For people who liked the Mass Effect series as an PRG, or simply for its story, this is such a let-down that it spoils the entire series. The ending is poorly implemented - plot holes, people appear in places they aren't, one person suddenly has powers that make no sense and are never explained - but the most frustrating thing is that for a series defined by making choices, there is essentially only one ending, meaning the choices made along several games are in the end almost completely irrelevant.

Another thing that i miss is mako and fighting through great enviroments like Virmire or ilos. And in general there was much more diversity of enviroments in me1. Me3 should have been all about discovering weaknesses, origin and reason behind reapers, even if we had to venture beyond previously inactive relays to alien and forgotten worlds.

The graphics and the combat system are ok for me, however many elements of the story line - including the so-called ""endings"" themselves - are simple rip-offs of other games. One of the most annoying aspects of the game is, however, that if you haven't had a save from ME2, then you can not really make good choices. I can not explain it further without revealing details from the story, but I can tell you that the game punishes players who did not play the previous episode(s), trying to motivate players to purchase those episodes as well. Summa summarum, the bad business model, the really... controversial ending and the constant feeling, that I have seen this before somewhere else makes me to advise everyone to avoid this game.

sniperking,"ME1 set the grand standard for the whole series. The best of the trilogy and I started playing ME2 first. ME2 had some problems but was still a great game. Tied in well with 1. To show that I am not trolling Bioware by writing this, I want to highly endorse playing ME1 and 2, they are why this series has such a passionate fanbase and are achievements in gaming in themselves. BUT BELIEVE THE OTHER GAMERS WHEN THEY SAY THAT ME3 IS BAD, IT IS FULL OF PROBLEMS. To break it down here why you should not support the direction Bioware took with ME3. 1. Three bad endings. Let's get one thing straight, fans love this game for its story, characters and world. Its combat was good but not its true selling point. So for Bioware to give us endings which provide no closure and instead tons of plot holes is a big disappointment. Not to mention that if you were involved with the game's 'lore', the ending would make absolutely no sense. I personally found the dialogue in this instalment particular dry, even boring. Not a good thing in a game where you spend a lot of time talking to NPCs. 2. The renegade/paragon system seemed more superficial in this instalment. Do not believe that you control the way the story develops by your so called choices. In the end you have 3 set endings and it seems like your choices are illusory at best. After a while I either forgot or didn't care about being renegade/paragon because the game seemed absent of truly reflecting the moral decisions I made.

AcacianLeaves,"How do you review a great game with a terrible ending? Ultimately, I think you review it the same way you would review a great movie with a terrible ending. The climax shapes the experience, and in this case the climax shapes how you experience and remember the previous hundred or so hours you may have invested in this series. I will not spoil anything, but after finishing Mass Effect 3 I have no desire to play it a second time. I have no desire to play any DLC. I don't even want to go back and play Mass Effect 1 or Mass Effect 2 again. The ending (there's really only one!) is just that bad. It has soured how I experience what was previously my favorite series of games in the last 10 years. In a little under 10 minutes, EA BioWare has taken all the joy out of the Mass Effect setting. I did not think that would be possible. I don't think we ""deserve"" a better ending. Even if we get one, the damage is done. This is the story they shipped. This is what they felt was a good end to the series. They have failed as writers, developers, and storytellers and their review score should reflect that. I can't, in good conscience, give this a 0/10 or a 1/10 - because there are moments in the game that I will remember fondly.

steveo9286,"First off I would just like to say that I am a HUGE man of the Mass Effect series, played the first 2 numerous times, and even read the first three books (I would have read the 4th, but since it was a different writer, and had overwhelmingly negative reviews due to glaring inconsistencies with the established history I seemed like it would be a waste) Now for Mass Effect 3 - I will try to keep this as spoiler free as possible, but some will probably make it in. You have been warned. The story continues about 6-8 months after the last DLC of Mass Effect 2 ""Arrival"" when the reapers invade Earth, as well as other planets throughout the galaxy. You escape the initial events in order to try and rally the other races of the galaxy to mobilize a massive counterattack to take back Earth, and ultimately the galaxy as a whole. Along the way you meet up with familiar faces from the first two games. Some only last little while, others will stick with you until the end, and you have the option to continue your romance with whomever you were going after (assuming they survived the first and/or second game). To me the character connections and development was the best in the series, and to my memory the best in any video game series to date. From having a friendly shooting competition with Garrus to Tali getting drunk using an ""Emergency induction port"" It just serves to bring a closeness with companion characters that no game has ever done before. It's not just sunshine, rainbows, and puppies though. Numerous characters end up making sacrifices so that you can succeed at your mission, which ultimately leads to my low review score but more on that later. Game play wise this game plays really similar to Mass Effect 2, combat is a bit more challenging and smooth. Weapons are now allow for much more customization through the use of extended barrels for damage increases, scopes for better accuracy, and ammo that allows to shoot people through cover, albeit with reduced damage. The cover system has also been improved quite a bit and plays more like Gears of War, though not quite as responsive while moving in cover, but it's still an improvement over ME2. Combat wise you see a decent variety with enemies, and in some cases it's better to target a specific enemy first as they can ""buff"" other enemies with armor, shields ect, but as mentioned earlier it's near identical to ME2. One last thing is that you now have a weight system that determines how often you can use your powers. For soldiers it's not as big of a deal since you have all 5 weapon slots used, and with the use of Ammo powers (ammo powers don't have cooldowns and weight does not effect them) it's not as big of a deal. For Classes with numerous Biotic/Tech powers It's more of a concern since you rely on weapon damage much less than the soldier, so it makes you think about what weapons (and how many) you want to load up with. The only notable thing missing are boss battles. Yes you do have certain enemies that you have to burn through multiple layers of defenses, but there is nothing like there was with Saren at the end of ME1 or the human reaper at the end of ME2. Now as many people across many sites have been saying the first 99% of the game is fantastic, it's the last 1%, or 10 minutes that completely ruin the game, and for some people the series. Without getting into specific spoilers it boils down to two main gripes I have with the ending. 1) Is that the plot device used to end the game came out of left field, there was no foreshadowing, evidence or anything else to prepare us for the emergence of this ""Deus Ex Machina"" and 2) The player loses any semblance of control or choice that they have had throughout the entire series, when it matters the most. The player is simply given options, that quite frankly feel disjointed from the overarching themes of the Mass Effect universe, and you have no way to argue or protest, it simply ""is what it is."" Add on top of that the ""different choices"" lead to what is ultimately a near identical result since you see ABSOLUTELY NO consequences of your decision.

DizzyKa,"Mass Effect 3 puts the cap ( or does it ) on one of my favorite series. Its been a long time since a game entered my favorites list, a long long time. Its also been a long time since I've been so emotionally invested in the characters and cared for their well being and futures. I credit this fact, at least in Shepard's case to Bioware's attention to the female Shepard option in 3. As a female gamer I felt very included, and to top it off I finally have a protagonist in a major gaming franchise that I can relate to. I can look at the box ( provided I've flipped the reverseable cover art ) and see something of myself in the hero on that cover staring back at me. I've seen the galaxy through Shepards eyes. I saw it as a young commander taking a ship for a test run picking up other rag tag young people along the way. I saw it as an emerging hero, responsibility beginning to weigh on my friends and my decisions. Finally, I saw it all burn. I saw the desperation in my friends eyes as we fought for what we all knew was impossible. It was an amazing journey. A lot of people are angry over the DLC. I for one was also irked by it, but its worth looking past. A lot of people are irked by the ending. I urge you, look deeper, its a lot better than you probably though. Its not as it seems.",10,2012-03-12,PC,user
THESTANKYLEG,Do not waste your money. Bioware has gone the way of most developers and are only in it for the money now. They have established a fan base and exploited them in every possible way. The more hardcore fans will defend Bioware but will lose faith over time to the lack of respect Bioware has for them. EA was the worst thing to happen to Bioware and this game is the nail in the coffin. Take your money somewhere else to a company that values its relationship to its customers. Tanking this score is the best thing you can do for this company now. DO NOT BUY,0,2012-03-12,PC,user

roland008,I have to give this game a low score. In almost all the ways that matter it was a great game. The elephant in the room though is that the whole trilogy was about choice and in the end it didn't really matter. All the hours you spent scanning and fight and making alliances mean nothing. You could just do the minimum for the whole series of games and get the same conclusion. There should be a good ending a neutral ending and bad ending if your into those kind of stories. The whole point of Mass Effect was that it was our story to tell and we didn't get to tell it.,1,2012-03-12,PC,user

Game doesn't offer any closure or answers to questions, rather it raises alot more questions then we used to have.

Lucubration,"As a player who has spend hundreds of hours replaying different possible paths in previous Mass Effect games, I can attest that the 'choice' of endings in this game have basically both killed my desire to further pursue Mass Effect titles and to seriously call into question the judgement of Bioware as a game development studio. The ending sequence to this title must have passed before hundreds of pairs of eyes within the company before going live; the fact that it made it out the door in this state is... largely unforgivable. Plot holes the size of Texas, a nonsensical story twist that just leaves players confused at the end, and an utter lack of closure for the trilogy, the characters, the galaxy, etc, with any 'choice' of ending.

Characters feel improved and voice acting seems better. On the bad side though the entire plot is filling with holes and lots of dues ex machinas. Even more so then the other games. Writing is pretty good but often feels worse the the first game. There are very few dialogue options which is a big disappointment even for RPG and story modes. Also in some ways the endings are interesting but some what disappointing. I like there being that ending but I feel like there should be more. Bioware threw some good story elements out the window for ""coolness factor"" and such. The plot also seems simpler and less knowledge requiring for new players (which can make the ME1 and 2 players suffer a bit). ME3 might be fun but that's not what makes an interesting game. In some ways I mean it is quite good but this barley makes neutral rating in my opinion.

sainta117,"There's a lot to like about ME3 - the voice acting, gameplay, sound, and NPC interactions and characterization are all top notch. Unfortunately, the core plot , which has always been just a touch suspect in the ME series, is outright disastrous this time around In some ways, this is a great case study in game design. If someone had been wondering if it was possible for a single bad writing decision to ruin a game, then that question has been answered, conclusively. There's almost nothing wrong with ME3, except the final sequence and ending. I've dearly loved the ME franchise for half a decade. I dearly loved the first 90% of this game. But that last 10% was so decisively awful, that I may never play the games (any of them) again. This needs to be fixed, and Bioware can (and should) do so.",5,2012-03-12,PC,user
Soonerfan2006,"I know many people are upset with the ending of this game, it's no secret. Even I was disappointed in the way everything played out. However, as a fan of the Mass Effect series since Mass Effect 1, I can't be over-critical of just the ending. I also need to give credit to the fact that Mass Effect 3 was a great game for 99% of the content. It had a very full continuation to the story of Shepard and there were seamless improvements to many of the features that I dreaded in ME/ME2. On top of the fantastic story that was presented there was also the Multiplayer function that was added. While it may only appeal to some people, it has been very well received overall. It's very addicting, and it can really be a great time sink for you and your friends. It promotes teamwork and punishes those who do not communicate. I hope to see some DLC in the future for the MP feature at some point, it has a near limitless expansion area. Back to the single player campaign, I can't rate this game lower than a 6 in good conscience just based on the ending, I won't lie, it's very upsetting and with that said 4 points off a perfect 10, which could have easily been achieved without that hole-filled ending, is quite a hit to the score without getting too over emotional. While I hope that Bioware will at least make a statement to appease us, I feel that the damage has already been done, damage which cannot be undone with simple means. A patch/DLC to add an alternate ending is possible, but the question will always remain as to why it was even needed in the first place. Bioware has talented writers and I praise them on creating the Mass Effect universe, but I wonder how they honestly thought this would play out in the end. In closing, Mass Effect 3 was a fantastic game, filled with combat and rich story-telling. It's sure to satisfy you right up until the end, where it drops the ball. Be warned if you decide to continue your Shepard's story as you may be left feeling ill.",6,2012-03-12,PC,user

whitespider999,"Mass effect 3 is a fitting conclusion to the mass effect saga. It boasts significantly improved gameplay fluidity and mechanics, as well as a more varied campaign. The story is emotional, hard hitting, and diverse. The games visuals have been improved a lot, and the pc version looks quite spectacular despite and aging core engine, and runs smoother than the previous games to boot. In terms of streamlining - which I hate - the game is in between mass effect 1 and 2, the major disappointment in the game is the planet exploring, which has been stripped down. Imported save games determine a lot, from entire characters no longer existing in the story to conflicts that play out entirely different.Multiplayer is fun, and is not required to get the best ending in the game. In the end, mass effect 3 is special. As good as mass effect 2 in storytelling, and almost as good as mass effect 1 in rpg-like skill/item medications and exp distribution.

vash1053,"The gameplay: Pretty decent. Makes some much needed improvements to weapon and armor customization. The need for a workbench was a little stifling, and you couldn't customize your armor pieces-- only which pieces you wear. Dialogue was decent, but there was almost NEVER a middle ""neutral option"". Too much auto-dialogue as well. Paragon/Renegade choices didn't really come into play until well past the middle of the game. The graphics: Good looking game. Animations, however, seemed robotic at times and lip synch was often painfully maligned. I'd say this was a step backward from ME2. The story: This is where things get really dicey. Older characters from ME2 only make quasi-cameo appearances, which irked a lot of people. The choices you made in the past two games mattered to some extent-- some more than others. For instance, I know that your choice on whether or not to save the Rachni queen or not was supposed to have a decently large impact on the game. As it turned out, it really doesn't. The Rachni under her control simply contribute to your military strength score and are never seen again. Okayyyy..... Character development is decently well done. There are some gut-wrenching choices you can make that can result in characters dying in very emotionally striking ways. So what's wrong? It's hard to explain just how sour things turn around the last hour of the game. Imagine if at the end of Return of the Jedi, Luke woke up in his bed on Tattoine only to realize the entire series had been a dream. Granted, that's not exactly what happens in ME3-- but it's the same sort of self-destructive ending. The ending is so nihilistic that it essentially invalidates everything that you've done in ME1 and ME2. It does this while creating EGREGIOUS plot holes and trampling over everything that had been established in the prior games and even lolBooks. Bioware claims that there are 16 endings, including several hidden ones. This is fallacious. All of the endings are based on the same 3 main ""endings"", which are all VERY similar in the first place. I could rant for hours about just how poorly this ending was carried out, but I digress. Check out this poll to see the general consensus regarding the endings and take solace in knowing you are NOT alone: ****/633606/polls/28989 Overall, the game was probably a 7/10 overall until the ending. The carelessness of the ending, the way that it comes out of left field and creates massive plot holes, and the complete and unavoidable destruction of the ME universe's unique attributes essentially invalidate the entire series. With no point in resisting, why replay the game at all? With that in mind, the game earns a 0/10 for me.",0,2012-03-12,PC,user

If you enjoyed ME2 but were hoping they'd deliver on their promise of adding more RPG elements... well too bad they lied. You get way less dialog choices, can only roam around on the Normandy and the citadel because every other place you just land, kill the bad guys, then leave - and not by choice, the screen just fades to black and your back on the Normandy. Then came the ending. What a giant obscene piece of garbage. No closure at all, most of it doesn't make much sense and feels very contrived.

The Bad: * They shoe horned multiplayer in and created a reason to make it pertinent. * The equipment (and hair) of the player models is constantly poking through. * 90% of the conversations you have do not offer choices of replies - they don't even bring up the conversation wheel. * Day one DLC which requires one line of code change in order to make it appear and which should have been part of the overall game as it was the one thing that managed to add some depth. * Failure to take into account player choices (from ME1, ME2, or ME3) with the ending. * Endings which appear to provide a choice, but don't. (What color would you like your universe destroying beam to be in?) * No sex scenes, demonstrating EA's editorial control over Bioware productions despite Bioware's claims to the contrary. * None of the side quests you complete appears to have any impact other than increasing your forces' strength for the final battle. The narrative that one might expect from Mass Effect for the individual units brought into play is not there. As a single game, it's a shallow and fun romp until the very last portion of the game. When you and Anderson are side by side with each other, chatting, stop. Right there is the best ending you can hope for - do NOT continue. Walk away and imagine your ending. You will be happier. As a series finale this game does NOT suffice. I don't care what theory you take to - that they wanted to show predestination, that Shepard was indoctrinated, that they're holding the series open for DLC. None of that matters. What matters is that the ending to the game - and the series - brings no closure for the player. NONE. People are claiming that those of us who are complaining about the ending are overreacting. I don't think we can overreact. I have spent hundreds of hours of my life playing this game, I overrode my ban on EA games in order to purchase it, I hoped as a property of Bioware that they would treat the series finale properly. All of those hopes were dashed, destroyed, thrown down, stepped on, and ground into tiny pieces. Don't buy this game. It's not worth your money. When it's a $5.00 special, it might be worth it. If Bioware rewrites the ending, it might be worth it. Right now? I spent $80.00 on the collector's edition and I wish I could get a refund - of my money, and my play time.

Pager,"Ignore the 1's and 0's on here. There is no possible way you could have played the other two mass effect games and give this a bad score. Bioware did a great job on this. They have improved every single aspect of the game and made it even better. The acting and the story are rich. The characters are believable. I spend a half hour walking through the ship after almost every mission, because there are so many things to do. The amount of dialogue and ways the story can change based on your decisions is astounding. I found decisions I made all the way back on Mass Effect 1 coming back to haunt me. The graphics are much impoved. Amazing. The powers feel like they have a lot more meat behind them and the weapons now sound realistic instead of some cheap toy. The areas you fight have the feel of a war instead some stiff wallpaper of mountains. The multiplayer is pretty cool. It's like horde mode for Gears of War, but with powers and items to unlock. I like how it directly impacts the single player campaign. Melding those together is something few games do. If you liked the first two games you will love this game. Do not listen to the bad reviews on here of 1 and 0. They obviously can't be taken seriously. I don't even like Call of Duty and I wouldn't give it that score.

JongUn,"Mass Effect 3 does not live up to the hype, at all. First of all, almost no graphics options. I mean what the hell? Just porting from console is so frigging lazy it makes me sick. Look at Remedy, they did it right with Alan Wake. The textures on some stuff in this game is absolutely hideous. The animations are bad (males walk really weird in this game ++). Some of the explosions and gun effects are really low quality. Then there is the FOV in this game, it reminds me of Resident Evil 5. Why can't you adjust ANYTHING in this game? Oh yeah, I forgot... it's a really bad console port. Also you have to use the space bar for absolutely EVERYTHING. On the plus side it has some great voice acting, interesting characters and locations. Not enough to make it worth my money though. Sadly. The last Bioware game I bought was Dragon Age 2, and yeah, I was very disappointed then as well. I hoped they would redeem themselves with this game, but I was unfortunately wrong. This is the last game I will buy from Bioware, and I can't recommend buying this game to others. If you want to play it, rent it, or buy it used on console.",4,2012-03-12,PC,user
Redzin,"This is by far the best Mass Effect game so far. The combat is better and more refined than in the previous games. The scenery is vastly improved, even though it was already very good in the previous games. The story is mostly as good as in the other ME games, however, there are some anoyances. Especially the beginning, it just seems to spout this idea of ""soldiers are badass, HOAH!"", as if the marketing department wanted to make the game appeal more to the Modern Warfare crowd. It doesn't last past the first mission or two though so it's not a big issue. Then of course there's the ending... which is unusual. I didn't mind it, honestly I found it refreshing. I encourage people to play this game, if nothing else then to experience the ending, the likes of which I seriously doubt has ever been seen in video games before.",10,2012-03-12,PC,user
SHr1KeD,"I honestly don't know why this game is getting so much hate. I absolutely LOVED this game and I'm extremely sad that the series is over. The game was emotionally exhausting. Especially if you carry over all your saves and play the game for its story and not the gameplay. I cared for every character in the game, even the villains were just amazingly done. The ending has been given a lot of hate too. I enjoyed the ending. It wasn't what I expected and I suppose that's why I liked it so much. Without spoiling anything. I did wish there was an ****, I still thought it was a very well way to wrap everything up. Simply put. I enjoyed the game. I will admit that the ""Rises From Ashes"" DLC should of been included into the game, I couldn't see how it shouldn't have been included, it contained a very, very important piece of the story. I wished it was a bit longer. I finished it and ALL side quest in about 35 hours. (Yes that may seem alot but time passes by when your having fun) Overall, I gotta give this a perfect score. I would rate the whole damn Series a perfect 10.",10,2012-03-12,PC,user
iamthespark,"Mass Effect 3 had me laughing, crying and truly entertained for 35 hours. It deserves recognition for pulling all those emotions out of a player, and to do it so consistently. The action and continuing romance of the series blew my mind. The developers listened to its fans when improving these two aspects of the game. My Love Interest (Liara) was so well written, and the time that her and Shepard did have together was meaningful. Playing this trilogy has been an honour and I hope Bioware continues creating titles that span numerous games like they did with Shep because after a span of 3 games, I felt like I really knew those NPCs and I was emotionally invested. Bioware also has a special place in my heart for creating same-sex characters and they will always have my respect for making that happen with a high-quality story. Day 1 DLC? I don't care. Bioware makes the kind of games that I want to play, and if they create more content, I will gladly pay for that content.",9,2012-03-12,PC,user

It was an epic tale that even made me choke up at certain points. I've never had such an emotional response from a game. Then there was the ending. It wasn't because Shepard dies (although it would be nice if he lived). It was because it made no sense. The game feels dumbed down. Deus Ex Machina stolen crappy ending that leaves a sour taste in my mouth. No thought from the developers and writers. I can't even restart the series again because of this. I'll never play a Bioware game again. Mass Effect died with the release of ME3. Bioware sold out to EA. If you played Mass Effect 1 and 2, stay away from this game.

dave1904,I loved mass effect from day one and waited 4 years for this part. I haye to say this game will be a very big disappointment for anyone who was a fan from day one. 99% of the game is 10/10 but if you ask me a story with a bad ending makes the hole series pointless and the biggest letdown in gaming history. Giving it a 7 out of 10 is very hard but honest and to everyone out there giving it a 0 I understand you but to give a game a 0 because of the day one dlc and ending is not justified.,7,2012-03-12,PC,user

SilentMobius,"This game should be a 9, I cared about the characters, the sense of drama was palpable. The action was furious without devolving into a pure shooter, even the side missions didn't feel as forced as they have in the previous games, for the most part it was fantastic. However, I have to knock off a point for general inexcusable QA failures (LI's not responding to actions in the previous games) another point for some horrific animation glitches (characters not facing each other when they talk eyes rolling back into heads, necks twisting 180 degrees), a point for the poor integration of the From Ashes DLC (Seriously, a Prothean? much more content was needed for such and important character, I'd have been happy to pay more for it), another point off for the multi-player which is good but the matchmaking is horribly unstable (On PC at least) making it a frustrating process, And finally a massive 4 points off for absolutely horrific and poorly thought out ending that has soured the whole series for me, and obliterated any replay value.

borfudin,"Mass Effect 3 is a travesty. The fact that it is mostly an excellent game isn't the point, and indeed makes what Bioware has done with the title even worse. Bioware has said that gamers new to the series can enter in with this game and be satisfied, and perhaps that is true. Having never played ME1 and ME2 and made decisions which felt extremely important at the time and been assured that those decisions would have lasting consequences, they would probably not feel the extreme sense of betrayal which many gamers (myself included) felt at the end of the trilogy. While technically it is a solid Action/RPG, perhaps even more so than the other games in the series, my dismal review reflects the fact that ME3 has lost its soul: it throws away the story-telling legacy of ME1 and to a lesser extent ME2, with a ridiculous Space Magic ending which should be a source of shame for whomever concocted it. Nothing the gamer has chosen appears to manner significantly when it comes to the actual outcome of the game, and the ominous and Chthonic Reapers appear to be a somewhat paradoxical cosmic joke. I am sure it will make a lot of money and as such validate the choices Bioware/EA have made, which is unfortunate for gamers everywhere. The Mass Effect trilogy began well and promised to be a truly unique experience, a science fiction universe for our generation, however it just ended up being about the money in the end. Unfortunate, but unsurprising, and perhaps that is the greatest let down of all.",1,2012-03-12,PC,user

AJ6432,"Mass Effect 3 is a fantastic game, despite a few flaws. Compared to Mass Effect 2, ME3 seems less polished. Graphically, the game looks fantastic, particularly the character animations and faces. However, there are some of the slow-loading textures that plagued the the first game, though not as abundant or drastic looking. I have also sparsely encountered this weird ""glitch"" where characters heads turn back and forth sporadically during conversations; there have even been one or two incidents where a character is fully glitched out of whole cut-scenes. Overall, though, the presentation is very well done. The sound is superb, from the voice-acting to the orchestral background music, living up to the Mass Effect name. However, the music doesn't stick out to me as well as the music from the second game. In terms of gameplay, the game is the best in the series, with solid shooting, squad, and cover mechanics; my only qualm with it is that the space bar, used for cover, is also used to roll (double-click) and interact with the environment, and when trying to perform one of these actions one may perform one of the others. The menus are more streamlined, except for the journal. Perhaps my biggest issue with ME3 is the journal. In the second game, your journal was separated into two categories: main missions and secondary missions. If you clicked on one of the missions, an outline would appear and display what you should do next in a mission. This is gone in ME3 and all of the mission appear under one category, and are not very organized. The codex is strangely also located under the journal, but this for me is not an issue. There is also the matter of obtaining secondary missions. In the second game, one had to engage in conversation with characters in an area to start sidequests. In ME3, one simply overhears conversations in an area and most of the secondary missions are automatically started. This feels less interactive and, simply, less engaging. My last issue with ME3 is searching the galaxy. While some (or more likely many) did not like the planet scanning/mining feature of the second game, I enjoy it, making me feel that I had to explore the whole galaxy and read all of the lore. In the third game, there a new system that involves avoiding Reapers in the galaxy; if they catch you while you are exploring a system and scanning objects, it's game over. While this system is fun, it also feels limiting. These issues aside, Mass Effect 3 is overall a wonderful game. It is definitely the most emotionally engaging game of the trilogy, and does not skimp on any story-telling quality. It is amazing to see how one's actions in the first two games culminates in the third game. While I do wish that your squad was larger than six options (downloadable content aside), the squadmates in combat and in conversation are seemingly flawless (graphical hitches aside). I highly recommend Mass Effect 3, but I even more highly recommend you play the first two games before this one for a truly emotional, interactive, and exciting experience!",9,2012-03-12,PC,user

pospulsar99,"I actually enjoyed the game greatly... People are correct in that there aren't a lot of changes to the gamplay from ME2, but that's because they already had a winning combination in my mind... The sheer number of things imported from ME1, ME2, and DLC was impressive to me... I've had completely different experiences than friends I've talked to... even down to in-game e-mails and news reports commenting on things being done by characters you left alive in previous games. I was also very impressed at the level of emotional involvement they can get you to invest... there are some characters that I really truly cared about, and the voice acting for some of them was spot-on. I think the main contributor to the Negative scores is the Ending... and I understand where others are coming from... for the most part, I was content... but there are elements to it that didn't make a lot of sense to me... a couple more options would have been good... Even a Dragon Age style ""Text Epilogue"" just saying ""So and So went on to do this..."" ""This character went off to do the following..."" would have been satisfying...

After so many hours of play, forgiving some HUGE bugs in the process, I was just too disappointed for words at the end.

Mugumaster,"I'm glad I didn't buy this game and listened to my gut feeling. I downloaded it and thought ""if it can stand up to the rest of the series I will buy it afterwards...."" No money from me here! This game is a total letdown! And what dissapoints me the most is that EVERY gamemagazine gives it a rating of 90+. This clearly shows that those game magazines just write what they are told from the gamecompanys .... very sad indeed. Now for Mass Effect 3: - Horrible long cutscenes with uneeded explosions everywhere to beef it up - Most of the time you had only 2 dialogue choices (Paragon, Renegade) and it was obvious which was what since paragon was always the upper choice and renegade the bottom choice - Missions were at first interesting but after 1-2 hours you get the feeling that there is no more innovation. Either you fight enemy waves, defend a point and fight off enemy waves, reach a checkpoint and survive while fighting enemy waves or fight enemy waves to push a button to fight more enemy waves .... - Combat system was a total letdown, I played as a biotic but most of the time i just used a sniperrifle or a slow firing rifle because it just owns everything else. - Biotic skills were totaly useless, I ended up reskilling and learn the talents my teammates gave me like infernogrenade or carnage - Flying around searching for stuff to beef up the army while avoiding the reapers got VERY boring VERY fast - The dialogue choices you had with your squadmates were too dull and you weren't able to bond a connection to them like in the previous games - Storywriting was bad, tried to skip all the time after a while since it just was plain bad - No matter which choices you made (like fake cure or real cure for krogans, save geth or quarians, save the arachniqueen, recruit alien races etc.) nothing did matter at the end. There was nothing that said what happened afterwards and the only reason to gather allied forces is only to make the end a little less bad than it already is. - The endings were a complete rippoff from deus ex - The endings were ALL bad, basicly you watched the same clip with a different coloured explosion and small changes but basicly all the ends lead to the same result without explaining ANYTHING I could go on with this list but I guess you get the point I'm trying to make clear ..",10,2012-03-12,PC,user

Tweed,"I've really enjoyed the Mass Effect series, but this last one, the one that was suppose to be the big climax is one of the biggest letdowns of the year so far. It really seems like Bioware cut every corner that could be cut while trying to maximize the amount of revenue they could generate from their community, there's a heavy emphasis on the multiplayer aspect of the game which actually does greatly hinder your effort to try and get a good ending out of this game. It really doesn't help that the entire multiplayer part is designed to be a complete grind short of spending actual money to buy packs to enhance their characters. Disregarding MP the single player is rife with issues, mostly related to the terrible attention to detail, characters are poorly animated and ""pop"" and ""spring"" about unrealistically during dialog so often it becomes impossible to ignore, on the central hub of the game npcs in the background run back and forth to nowhere if they're animated at all, actors in the distance are nothing more than distorted 2 dimensional sprites or unskinned models that look more like cardboard cutouts or paper mache figurines than people. Cutscenes and dialog cannot be skipped making replay a major task for anyone who wants to see the hidden ending that requires finishing the game at least once. Attempts at continuity on Bioware's part are admirable and one of the highlights of the game, but it becomes lost in the mess of a plot, the impossibility of Earth holding out while Shepard gathers the forces of the galaxy is handwaved away and one of the main antagonists of the game winds up being a carbon copy of Mass Effect 1's villain. It also really doesn't help that Bioware decided to shift the focus of the plot right at the very last moment of the game to steal Deus Ex: Human Revolution's plot line and ending style, then expect the player to merely accept this without question. The endings are vague and unsatisfying, leaving any fan who has followed this series right from the very beginning to be extremely disappointed.",1,2012-03-12,PC,user

In the final mission I expected to utilize all of my squad, since they build up this huge battle with entire galaxy joining forces. No, you pick 2 of your squad members and that's it.

Sun_Tzu,"Most of the main missions are well done, you can generally get the resolutions you want, with some consequences sprinkled in. For this, the game gets about a 9. I truly enjoyed myself. Side quests are weak, they mostly consist of mindless grinding, which is never a good thing in a game. I wanted more on-site side quests as in ME1 and ME2, but was sorely disappointed. For this the game gets maybe a 3. And then there's the ending. In fact, the entire final mission was a huge letdown for me. It's the greatest betrayal **** franchise I've ever experienced, and I've been around since the Commodore-64 days. It makes no sense, it spits in the face of the loyal fan, and it has ruined not only this game, but every preceding game for me. The ending is so bad that it eclipses every positive thing you could ever say about the game. It's a -10 experience. So we end up with a final score of 2.

Then they turned said main character into a braindamaged invalid unable to question orders of a random star-child-god-thing. They removed any actual choice, as in the end each ending is just the same thing with different colors. Science fiction went out the window for random crystal-crazy metaphysics and some omnipotent star-child. First Dragon Age 2. Then issues with TOR.

Fourdee,"Mass effect 1 - had many issues, but showed promise in a franchise. Mass effect 2 - A step forward in combat mechanics and streamlined gameplay, a step backwards in freedom with a linear exploration feel Mass Effect 3 - A quick money making title, ignoring the basics of animation and gameplay mechanics. PC ignorance is bliss here. I dont know what game the review companies are playing, but its not the one purchased. A huge disappointing to a franchise that has gone from RPG to a FPS with poor movie style cutsceens. The SPACEBAR is used for running, rolling around, selecting world objects. It fails most of the time and you find yourself rolling around when you try to run. You find yourself standing still when your trying to run because a world object came across your hud. The animations are dreadful, for a game that trys to sell itself as a movie, it feels like they forgot about animating your player, the one you stare at. At the start of the game, you are given an option to either play the game as Action/RPG/Social. Action is the default setting, RPG claims to be ""the mass effect experience"" but none of the options actually provide you with information on what you gain or lose from each. The end product feels rushed, forced on console gamers and a huge disappointing to a player who loved ME1/2. It seems bioware has lost interest in making ""SOLID"" games, its a company that just wants to roll in on past victories, and forgets why people loved their 1st games.",3,2012-03-12,PC,user

But I didn't give it a terribly high score either because this COULD have been a truly great game. Unfortunately it seems to have been pushed out the door before it was completely ready. It also appears to have been ""dumbed down"" as far as its RPG elements go in order to appeal to a mass audience. Knowing what I know now, I would have waited until it went on sale instead of paying full price. Hopefully, with a patch or two, perhaps a (free) DLC to fix the ending and this game will live up to its full potential.

The Mass Effect universe was second only to Dune. The storytelling and acting were deep and meaningful, and the game just FELT enormous, even if it wasn't. You had so much freedom to do things your way, that it was mind boggling. The sequel narrowed the scope to your ship and your companions, telling a deeper, more personal story that blended wonderfully with the broad moral strokes in the first. Sure, you had to be a completion junkie to get the perfect ending, but the characters were fascinating, their stories meaningful, and the voice acting was superb. I really cared about the people I went to battle with, so much that I happily replayed it entirely just to make sure that one crew member survived. And then comes three. It starts out very serious, if a bit disjointed. You have saved the galaxy twice, and you still got court-marshaled? Your estranged companion is thrust upon you and then taken away. Relevant members jump in and out at complete random, you have no control over whether or not people live or die, and the woefully limited, boring citadel (seriously? How do you make the CITADEL boring this time?) is just a place where you go to get side quests that are essentially a dull minigame that doesn't even encourage exploration. Your companions are very mismatched, with Garrus and EDI being the only really meaty characters. Joker is thrust into some disjointed, ultra-serious role, and the animations make his eyes look downright crazed. All the animations are pathetically stiff and wooden. Why not simply use the wonderfully animated SWTOR engine and simply transplant the gorgeous textures? The stories are short, the side quests are almost meaningless and always presented exactly the same way. You either fly around collecting items whose relevance is never explained, and running from reapers in the minigame, or you are on a tiny, repetitive map fighting for equally irrelevant resources. The combat is okay, but feels so sluggish and imprecise that you can feel the ""controller-itis"" in its DNA. So low marks there. Also, I don't know about the other classes, but the Vanguard feels downright worthless, with absolutely no synergy in its skills, whereas in the first two, it was a fast paced engine of destruction. The new relationships are shallow, jerky, and forced upon you so quickly and back-to-back that it's laughable. And then the whole story draws to a conclusion. All that work you did to unite the galaxy, seems to have no impact or weight whatsoever. The final mission is disjointed, and all it appears to change is the length of your cutscenes, because it all boils down to the ending. The choices you're presented with mirror nothing that makes sense, let alone what your goal was. No matter what type of person you chose to play in the Mass Effect series, the ending presents nothing that you have any interest in pursuing. Not to mention glaring plot holes and absurdities. The ending was so bad, it single handedly ruined the entire series for me. After learning how things turned out, I will probably never pick up a Mass Effect title again. Nothing you can do will alter the eventual outcome, either. Finally, we get to the day one DLC. I didn't knock off a point from Portal 2 for having it. That DLC was cosmetic and completely unnecessary. But the DLC that adds 1% to the game and costs 20% of its retail cost and should have OBVIOUSLY been included, is the final nail in the coffin for bioware. I don't like making broad generalizations, but after the awfulness that was I can't help but get the feeling that EA has finally destroyed what was once my favorite RPG makers. The Mass Effect universe was the most astonishingly well-conceived, lore-ridden universe in gaming history, and EA just destroyed it. The user score (and it's not like the /v/ bombing of portal 2, which I stood against) clearly shows that EA just pays for ratings, because while barely tolerable as a game itself, the second you finish it, there is no way you can seriously sit back and think ""That made sense. That ending was totally logical.""",1,2012-03-11,PC,user
Cottonswab,"Overall, not a bad game but that being said it's not a good game either. Game play is nearly identical to mass effect 2 which in and of itself is not bad as ME2 had great game play. Level design is more open than in ME2 where at times it felt like a series of narrow hallways. Where the game falls short is in the storyline especially the ending. There are numerous plot holes depending on the choices made in the earlier games. As for the endings, there are 3, but the choices made in game have no effect on which one you get, you simply choose one after the final mission. The end also has virtually no closure for your squad members or any of the other races involved in the war. Voice acting ranges from good to bad. A decent game but not what I've come to expect from the Mass Effect series.",6,2012-03-11,PC,user

DatAsianGuy,"Look, I know everyone is butt hurt about the ending and many fans are angry at bioware, but i dont agree with many of the reviews and I have been a DIE HARD Bioware fan since Baldurs Gate I have bought and played hundreds and hundreds of hours playing their games and I believe Mass Effect 3 was perfect. (here comes the flaming). But, ask yourself how else would it end? they have said that this game is the end of Commander Shepards Story and that he will not appear in future games, but does that mean its a bad game? No, it doesn't and the story writing was impressive and voice acting was done well. I had several moments where I had to put down my controller and think about what I was about to do. The thing is I love this game, the universe, the good AND the bad although i dont consider multiplayer bad based on how much fun I have and the challenge of gold and the AI for insanity mode in the story. Sure the ending isn't what you had expected or wanted it was still a great experience. Also, Lord Mandalore terrible animation and graphic issues? seriously? what are you playing on? and the story wasn't dumbed down at all, have you even looked at the scripting an storylines of other games? Also, about the Day 1 DLC they finished it after the game was completed and shipped, SO WHAT? It took considerable amount of time to create the DLC if any of you have EVER tried to script, voice over, integrate and even add more lore into a game already developed I personally would like you to do it in 2 months and then give it away for free to EVERYONE. Then and ONLY then can you **** about the DLC release. Seriously if it came out 2 weeks later everyone and their mothers would **** themselves out for it but just because its out the same day people **** and moan.

Grungi,"I have to give the game a 5; I can't think of any other score that would accurately portray the mix of positive and negative impressions I have of the game. From a production perspective, it's an absolute masterpiece from start to (almost) finish. I would even go so far as to say that it's the most technically perfect game that I've ever had the pleasure to play. Were I scoring on that basis, I would give it a 10/10 without hesitation. But (some of) the writing .. the DLC .. the singleplayer/multiplayer fiasco .. I don't want to give any spoilers out here, and I'm sure anyone who has beaten the game is well aware of what I speak .. Bioware has effectively killed the franchise for a lot of people. At the time of writing, the official forums are aflame with the vitriol that only hardcore fanatics can muster.

If they had written an ending as good as the rest of the game/series, this game would be great -- I'd even overlook the plotholes/failures to explain things (which are pretty bad in spots).

joker1991,"I was afraid that Bioware might ruin at some point the whole mass effect magical and absorbing **** fears came true.Where should I start? I played the PC version and I was really disappointed in game's graphics.There are obvious signs that the game's graphics were done in some kind of a rush.Awful textures in some points during the **** a 2012 game they look really bad .Once again PC gets a port.I am no complaining about performance since FPS rate is stable,but these textures look really ugly nowadays.What about gameplay? They made it more action,more Michael Bay style **** a result we have bad written dialogues and on top of that we can't make a lot of real decisions during the **** this negative stuff, was obviously done for action's sake and gameplay feels a lot like GOW series.Thus, the mass effect magic is lost in the third installment of the franchise. Moreover,I can't understand the whole multiplayer point,Mass effect was always a trully single player experience,why ruin this now? The worst of this addition is that multiplayer affects the game's final battle.What were they thinking? Usually people play first the single player part then the ****'s simply **** for war assets feature it seemed to me quite cool in the beginning but afterwards I understood that it don't count as it should. Last but not least,there is a really messy badly written ending in the end of the game.Bioware gives us 3 options which all lead to an unpleasant ending.I don't say that I wanted an ending taken from children's tales where everyone lives and stays happy at the end.Though,it's really harsh to watch that all the decisions that were made in previous games simply don't count at all.This is the part why many Mass Effect's fans got angry.They can't just so simply erase our ****'s ironic that they were saying all these years to keep the save games as they will change the whole experience in the 3rd game of the franchise.They were **** about thousands of factors that will make a difference. All in all,I realized in the end that spent 100 hours in Mass Effect universe,I made hard decisions,I bonded emotionally with game's characters and finally I made the impossible to unite galaxy's races only for nothing.Even the war assets don't count a lot,you have fleet of Turians,Geth,QuariansHuman,Asari and all this for nothing.",7,2012-03-11,PC,user

ChrisCat378,"I was a huge fan of Mass Effect 1 and 2. Not to the point of having Shepard posters in my room or wearing N7 hoodies, but I really enjoyed the Mass Effect story and more importantly the characters I have come to know and love. I was loving Mass Effect 3 and everything in it. How stories where wrapping up, seeing familiar faces triumph, and watching some choices unfold in the last chapter. That was up until the last 10 minutes. Nothing I had done mattered, no resolution, nothing even close to being satisfying. What happened to the divergent story lines? What happened to the characters I have invested so much time getting to know? How can a game franchise built on choice and decisions boil the last and most important 10 minutes down to a few outcomes that are largely the same? I was planning on playing this game over and over like I have with ME1 and ME2 but now.... I dont even feel like starting it up. The ending has **** so much enjoyment I had in this series its amazing. I wasnt expecting miracles or a story book ending... but certainly not this. I have no motivation to play again or any of the previous games. I didnt think it was possible to rob so much enjoyment out of the series with the last 10 minutes.. but they did. It would take a lot of effort to think of a worse way to end it. As a player you should want to finish the game, you want to see the outcome, and you want to see the repercussions of you actions from the 100+ hours of gameplay before.

The ending is SO BAD it actually retroactively makes ME1 and ME2 worse. It is now a spectacle show like MW3, BF3, GoW3 and so on. It's a cash cow. And for a series like Mass Effect, we - the fans - expected more. But no. Bioware is dead. It was a fun ride, we will try to remember you for what you were, not like you are now with ME3 and DA2. From Ashes is SUCH an important story for all ME fans, it should have been included with all new versions of the game. It's now clearly a case of ""lets make as much money we can from this series before we kill it"". And it was killed. Hard. The ending of ME3 is probably the worst in any game ever.

MikeMaximus,"Lets get the bad stuff out of the way first, and sadly it is mostly bad. Yes the game comes with day 1 dlc, but if you've bought a big release EA game in the last 3 or 4 years you should be used to this by now. It's not worth coming on here and giving a zero over no matter how much it ****. The biggest fault of ME3 is that it feels even more linear in comparison to the previous games, you are funnelled along a set path of main quests with other systems only randomly appearing on your map once you reach a certain place in the story line. It's almost like a linear FPS trying to pretend that it's still an RPG. The side quests are also extremely lame fetch types that you generally come across while running by conversations in the citadel with the odd extra N7 mission during your journey. Mining has been replaced with another ""scanning"" mini-game to find extra resources for your war effort, it feels like a cheap waste of time, mostly because there isn't much to explore really and it could have been a lot more interesting. Thankfully the hacking and circuit mini-games from ME2 have been removed completely. The story & dialog is really hit and miss, mostly miss, your choices from the previous games don't seem to have any kind of large meaningful impact on the big picture, but I need to test this more with multiple playthroughs. The differences between your paragon and renegade choices seemed, odd to me in a lot of cases, almost like they were mixed up. It seems a lot less thought went into story, dialog and character development this time around, or it was rushed. Now the good things, the combat has been streamlined and in my opinion it's probably the best out of the series. It's a little faster, there are more powers and they are fun to use. The production values are extremely high, it looks good, sounds good and the voice actors all did an incredible job for the most part. It isn't much of a boost technically when compared to ME2, but it is still an improvement in most areas, my only issue is some of the animations, especially running, just looks wrong. Now oddly enough my personal saving grace for this game is what most think is blasphemy, the multiplayer. I find the multiplayer extremely well done over all, it's easy to hop into, it's fun and addicting and provides a good challenge. It also gives a little boost to your single player campaign but it ISN'T required to get the best ending as some idiots on here have been giving a 1 or 0 over.",7,2012-03-11,PC,user
derOlifant,"First, since the question of the genre seems to be so important to a lot of people, I want to say that I do not usually play action games. My favourite genres are roleplaying and turn-based strategy, and I think two of the most brilliant games ever developed are ""Baldur's Gate 2"" and ""Planscape: Torment"". ""Mass Effect 3"" is no classical RPG like BG2 or Torment, but neither can you do it justice by labelling it a simple or even ""dumbed-down"" action game. Sure, there are lots of action in ME3. Few care to mention, however, how well this action is implemented into the overall concept of the game and how utterly believable it feels. This is no action for action's sake. This is no Roland Emmerich kind of action, spectacular but hollow once the smoke of the explosions has settled. The game makes you care about this universe in danger and creates an atmosphere of extreme urgency and desperation that is manifest in almost every single action sequence. The fights are not very tactical, but neither are they too easy or banal. They feel grim and desperate and immensely important (and what is equally important: they are a lot of fun and very satisfying). Characters you care about (and many of whom already appeared in the previous games) die, and their deaths really leave you shocked and sad, because this is something one does not normally expect in this kind of game, but also because the characters around you actually feel like real living people (or aliens). And this is where the game really shines. After or during missions, the patient listener is rewarded with lots of dialogue.

Trebek,"While I loved the first two ME games, I just can't get behind the third. It seems like for every positive change that has been made, 3 or 4 bad ones have been added as well. For example, while there is finally a good reason to play a soldier rather than an adept which in my opinion was by far the best class in the first two, there are now a few 'features' that I despise. Forced multiplayer is a massive disappointment to me. I know it can be argued that it's not actually forced since the game can be played from start to finish is true, but multiplayer having *any* effect on gameplay or story is a big disappointment. This game had absolutely no need to shoehorn in multiplayer, but it's now being billed as a 'feature'. This leads nicely into my second complaint which is that this so called bonus in the form of multiplayer makes EA feel justified in charging for day one DLC in 'from ashes'. This makes me feel mugged that even after a preorder you can't get the whole darn game on launch day. I like how these days a preorder edition means you'll still need to buy an expansion pack on day one to have the whole game. My third gripe is this business with Origin being a requirement to play the game. The corporate shills at EA are setting up a competing service to steam, all right, fair enough but sleazy statements such as ""We believe in absolute freedom of choice to allow customers to buy through whatever retail outlet... as long as they're buying an EA game, we're delighted,"" show they don't respect their customers when they turn around and pull their games from the most popular digital download services. EA claims they did this same thing with Crysis 2 because the DLC was not available for purchase on steam.... This ticks me off a lot since the DLC for ME2 was so well hidden I spent 45 minutes trying to buy 'the arrival' on their awful maze of websites that I *was glad* valve will now be forcing publishers to make DLC available through steam. I've had quite enough of EA's awful DLC distribution methods in the past and am not looking forward to finding out if this time will be any better. So in summary - an allright game, seriously marred by both technical own goals (forcing extra software to be installed), sleazy marketing, greedy day one DLC, and a general aura of disrespect to the community.

mr_fails,"There are so many people who claim that this game was a huge letdown from two because the RPG elements are even further gone. After playing this game for about 10 hours, i can say that in my opinion, that is a gigantic load of crap. The choices for equip-able armor are more true to the ones of mass effect with their brand names, the weapon upgrade system is much better now, seeing as they actually have upgrades instead of some **** computer and the need to scan planets to gather resources. Some of the characters, like James , are undeveloped but can you really blame the guy? He came in on the last game of a fully established trilogy. As for the story, yes, compared to mass effect 1 it is dumbed down but compared to mass effect 2 it is much better. I enjoyed mass effect 2 because of the game-play, not because of the story. In ME 3 you are tasked with journeying around the galaxy and creating a united banner under which to combat the reapers in the final showdown. Compared to the ME2 plot line of get some random mother **** to travel to their possible death with you, its a lot better. As for other elements, i love the challenge ME3 brings. in ME2 you could stand behind cover and trow warp at people and never get hurt. ME3 brings a much greater challenge. It requires players to actually use strategy rather than sit behind an impenetrable wall for years. The combat mechanics are much more refined than 2 and the return of grenades is a very welcome mechanic. Overall, ME3 deserves around an 8.5 where ME1 would receive a 9.75 and ME2 would receive an 8 just to give you an idea of where i stand. Its not GOTY material but ME3 is a good game that deserves at least one play-through.

Graphics are subpar and look reminiscent of Mass Effect 2. Bugs out the ass with regards to graphics and in some aspects of gameplay. Lots of upgrades and other things to waste player time and seem to take from the gameplay experience rather than give to it. I got about 30% through the game and lost all interest in it.",2,2012-03-11,PC,user

SelphieNutter,"I like many have been a fan of the Mass Effect series since the start of it 5 years ago, the 9th of March was a joy full day for me as it marked the release of the Epic final all us fans had been waiting for. My collectors edition turned up early in the morning on the 9th & I was so thrilled & excited I couldn't wait to get the disc into my xbox. After downloading my DLC & soundtrack I imported my Mass Effect 2 character & started my game. I was so happy it was like all my birthdays had come at once, as I made it to the end however it was a different story. I found myself feeling crushed & betrayed by a poorly made ending that had no relation to the storyline of the previous games & made me feel like I'd wasted my time & my money. I can no longer look at Mass Effect or Bioware the same way I did before playing Mass Effect 3 the whole thing has forever left a bitter taste in my mouth & I know I am not alone in this.",1,2012-03-11,PC,user
L0rd0fSn0W,"Mass Effect 3 in most cases was like the best piece of pie I have ever eaten in my life until I got to the end and realized the crust was moldy. Like many others on this site I had played the game since Mass Effect 1 and feel like Bioware really tried to rush this one out. My biggest hatred of this game was that all choice was just ripped away from the players, Bioware for the most part let us run free in the first two games making any decision we felt was needed but then once we got to ME3 Bioware decided that they wanted to end the game on their terms and thats what really ticked me off. The so called 16 different endings you can have really fail to have any big difference from one another and they all end with the same outcome of the galaxy being plunged into even more chaos then the reaper Invasion. That being said there were some parts of this game that really startled me to how good they were, the mission were you retake the Quarian home world was absolutely fantastic as were most of the conversations with Garrus. As for the rest the injustices could go on and on, killing off pretty much all of your ME2 squad companion after spending that entire game getting to know them was just harsh and unneeded, shafting all the romances (Miranda, Tali, etc) and instead shoving homosexual relationships and forcing us to choose either Ashley or Liara also was annoying. The ridiculus script and the plot holes that were everywhere during this game were to big to ignore and the inclusion of squad mates that I'm pretty sure no1 used (JAMES). I never even had a conversation with the guy because looking at him reminded me to much of Jersey Shore. One last thing, the multiplayer isn't to terrible it can actually be really fun if you get a few buddies together and play but when you have to rely on complete strangers where if one of them is an idiot you ussually get screwed. As for the day 1 DLC, welcome to the world of big corporations seeing nothing but $$, I have a feeling that in order to fix a lot of the plot holes Bioware will just keep churning out DLC, heck they might go the direction of Fallout 3 and since every1 is rightfully screaming about the ending they'll offer you a new ending if you do all the DLC.",1,2012-03-11,PC,user
BadlyBrowned,"The game is an absolute masterpiece through through the beginning to the climax. However, in the end it becomes apparent that the writers had a vision for a sort of Greek tragedy for the series, complete with a deus ex machina and endings that vary from ""really dark"" to ""kinda dark."" There is no happy ending, no real catharsis for Shepard. However, it is not the darkness that bothers me as much as the execution of the resolution. It feels so convoluted and illogical considering the themes and narratives that have taken place through the 3 games. In fact, it would make more sense to me if the so called ""resolution"" turned out to all be a dream. The game itself is very good. The level design was much improved over previous installments, and storytelling wise they generally did an excellent job creating a story that could account for all the possible Shepards. Not everyone from previous games are available as squadmates, but I felt they generally all got enough screen time to do good by the fans. Overall, it was a very engrossing and enjoyable experience, up until the last 5 minutes or so. Because of that, I have to bump it down from a 10/10 to an 8/10.",8,2012-03-11,PC,user

Punya,"I loved ME1 and ME2, and ME2's ending set the perfect scenario for ME3... So, how did Bioware manage to mess up so badly with ME3? That's a real mystery. ME3 is simply boring: almost all rpg elements are gone, all that remains is a poor 3rd person shooter... Totally useless, considering there are tons of better shooters out there. Level design is bad: linear and repetitive (no need for a map), with endless waves of the same enemies. Skill choices and progressions are too limited. Dialogue choices are sporadic and messy: the short selection sentences are often unrelated to the subsequent dialogues. Cutscenes are uninspired and flavorless, and even the voice actors are not at their best compared to previous games (direction's fault?). The plot is messy and insubstantial, loading one sequence after another without any real meaning between those. Even romances seem quite forced and amiss. There is no real feeling **** war going on around Shepard, nor any impact on player's decisions. Previous choices from ME1 and ME2 are virtually neglectable: you simply get one NPC instead of another, but nothing changes. What else? The game is too short, animations are really poor, and PC porting is simply horrible. Not even worth pirating: stay away from ME3, and maybe EA/Bioware will finally understand users are not dumb as they think.",0,2012-03-11,PC,user

cerberusd,"When all is said and done, this is the first game since Half Life 2 where every second I felt the blood sweat and tears of those who toiled to engineer this titan ****. That hard effort doesn't quite manifest itself in the same awe-inspiring perfection the way it did in Half Life 2, but Mass Effect 3 comes pretty damn close. Every aspect of gameplay, from the pacing, variety, balance, story, and art design, sets industry standards. The only place where ME3 falls flat is in its format, the third person shooter. It simply doesn't lend itself to a immersive, cohesive experience that the FPS format did for Half Life 2. The other weakness is that it doesn't utilize any revolutionary technology. The game looks nearly identical to Mass Effect 2 -not that that's necessarily bad- but a complete revamp of the engine would have been better for a game of this magnitude. These are pretty big negatives I know, and the critic in me wants to give the game a 9.3 or 9.4. But given the current state of gaming development, where designers opt for security rather than ambition, and truly epic, monumental gaming experiences exist only in our memories, this game truly 'deserves' a 10/10. I am writing this review of any true gaming fan who is having doubts about whether to spend his or her hard earned money on this game. If you felt that gaming changed in the last several years, that developers lost that ambition to achieve in a game the human mind's greatest, most powerful imaginations and desires, then this game is your answer and cure. This is undoubtedly Bioware's Magnum Opus, and a testament of the highest order to what games can achieves as an art form.",10,2012-03-11,PC,user
Mommaandrea,"I finished ME3 this morning at 6:30, staying up all night to finish it. I am a huge fan of the series. Played both ME1 and ME2 multiple times. I love the story and relationships and it makes me laugh and sometimes cry (Talitha ""I remember me"") the Ending utterly ****. The end **** so...anti climactic and stupid. It's the only way I can describe it. I'm fighting with giving details because I don't want to spoil it for someone. But for me those last few moments of the game didn't answer any questions or make anything clearer. Honestly, it looked like they had no idea and slapped an ending on. All the sappyness and good byes isn't even my problem, I expected that and in a way wanted it. It is the final choice and the lack of explanation by this supposed higher being, whom I wanted to shoot. Stupid ending to a much anticipated game.",2,2012-03-11,PC,user

SSJ5,"The game itself is pretty damn good. Not the best of the series, but you know, pretty damn sold. The thing that bugged me is as you probably know the ending. It annuls everything you have worked for in the past games and DLCs. I have spent countless hours studying the games online, and have got over 100 hours of gameplay combined for the first two games, to get the perfect ending possible. But, apparently I have to play multiplayer to get the best ending. Bioware will tell you otherwise, but I know what I experienced. And the ending is inevitably grim and hopeless. You just can't get the ending you were working for all this time. I bought every DLC to make sure I had all the assets I needed to fight the Reapers and win. But Bioware would have me denied that. Well, you know what? I will deny Bioware my money. I give it a zero because the ending ruins the experience to such a degree that even though you can replay the game with different choices ... What's the point? You get the same thing over and over. Bittersweet ending with a grimdark future for the galaxy. I honestly regret buying the Collectors Edition. I sold it yesterday to a poor fool who doesn't know what he's in for. If you like Mass Effect series, stay away from this game. It bring your spirits up, only crush you utterly at the end.",1,2012-03-11,PC,user
Mnem0,"Mass effect 1 & 2 were my favorite story-driven RPG games. To provide a point of reference, I would give ME1 a 9.5, ME2 an 8.5, and I was ready to give ME3 a 10 up until the ending. In comparison to the previous games in the series, ME3 has improved combat mechanics, great animation, fantastic cut-scenes and very powerful and moving moments with characters from the previous games. Some of the later Tali scenes almost brought tears to my eyes. The team AI is even better - they don't needlessly wander off into fire and die anymore. With that said, I'm not sure I could imagine a worse ending. I use the singular ""ending"" because that's basically all there is. Renegade or Paragon, you do the same thing, and it doesn't make sense in either case. Because of the quality of the game leading up to the ending, it probably deserves a higher rating, but the ""finale"" makes me too angry to give it one. The loss of Drew Karpyshyn (writer of ME1 & 2) is strongly felt. Knowing EA, they'll probably see all our anguish as a way to make money and we'll get our ending, but have to pay for the DLC that provides it. I won't pretend like this will cause me to never buy another EA/Bioware game, but I sure will think hard before becoming invested in their games. This could have been the best game of the past 10 years, and instead I'm left feeling heartlessly gutted.",1,2012-03-11,PC,user

OverwatchUK,"Mass Effect 3 overall is a fantastic game that I thoroughly enjoyed. Putting the past 4/5 years of effort into multiple play-throughs of both previous games I had high expectations of ME3 which were (mostly) fully met and realised. That is; until the last 15 minutes of the game. The finale takes absolutely no notice of any choices you have made in the previous games and boils down to ""Press Red, Green or Blue to finish the game"". As a new-comer to Mass Effect this won't matter and will overall be a great game - But to those players who have invested time and effort into the franchise, the ending scenes will feel like a crushing blow. As a huge Mass Effect fan, I felt dirty upon finishing it - Like I'd been **** and then spat on. Wrapping up 3 games, Over 80+ hours of gameplay with a Red, Blue or Green decision... Gutted.

Lauz,"Such a let down. First two games in the series were amazing. Such amazing character interaction, the paragon/renegade options and control over how your characters personality grows throughout the game. Engaging side quests and interesting story twists. All of these things that made the series great have been removed for Mass Effect 3. The amount of choices in the first two games gave the user a great sense of control over their Shepard and led to satisfying results, Mass Effect 3 (not unlike Dragon Age 2) give the user the illusion of pretending they have a choice in the storyline yet no matter the choice, the result is generally the same; give or take a few minor details. They have effectively taken the role playing out of this role playing game and turned it into a typical shooter with dull cut-scenes and a real lack of control over the character's development and personality. And the climax to the series? Well, without spoiling it, I think I'd rather bang my head against the wall than experience such a bland, disenchanting and completely lacking ending to such a long journey.

SOAR21,"I've played this series since game 1, and I've read a lot of the negative reviews. While I was disappointed with this game, and while I did note many (most) of the mentioned issues with the game. Yes, Bioware should've foreseen the fallout of the DLC, and just released it as part of the game. Corporate world; welcome to it. It's not like this is uncommon these days in the industry (or any industry). However, I think lamentations of the writing issues and gameplay have been blown out of proportion. When I finished the game I was quite disappointed since I don't think I've played a game with higher expectations. My main issues were the stub of a story they called the main plot. I did reach 25 hours or so of singleplayer gameplay, but a lot of it was chasing war assets in every cluster of the universe. Also, the half-hearted ending that made me feel like my 100 or so hours of ME gameplay were wasted. Multiplayer is not required for the best ending. I played 25 hours of singleplayer and got the best possible ending, though admittedly collecting war assets was quite tedious. They could've done more with the characters; I only lost Kaidan in ME1, yet, felt like all my efforts saving my team were useless since I saw some characters only a few times. The new party member they add is a complete joke, a dead-end of a character. However this game is not a 0 out of 10. Anyone who rated a 0 is someone who underwent the same feeling of disappointment I did then just lashed back. Story-wise, definitely the worst game of the series. Characters come and go in a blur; relationships consist of just a few conversations. Gameplay-wise, however, ME3 is much better in my opinion. Harder fights, more varied enemies, smarter enemies, more organic-feeling powers. More customization than ME2, thankfully, but also thankfully less than the smothering options in ME1. Environments were very varied, as were the situations. Multiplayer is just coop wave gameplay over and over again, but the combat is good enough that I'm finding myself playing a lot of multiplayer and still not getting bored, as are thousands of others. I don't expect to log that much more time on multiplayer, but it'll last me longer than such a simple system should, and that is because of the excellent combat. I am still a great fan of the series though this one dropped the ball a little. I'm considering another playthrough from the very start. All in all, a feasible buy, but hardly the game of the year.",6,2012-03-11,PC,user

Probably the fact that last stand is in London didn't help as the game was launched first in the US and the regular end US user may be used more with ""Independence day"" movie approach than something like this.

JaimeRaz,"I was so eagerly waiting for this game to come out since I finished ME2 . I was literally counting the days to get it, and play it with all my 5 different Shepards. I was counting on to experience all my different choices, coming to life with different variations and stories. I definitely thought that this game was going to have a big re-playability value, based on what Bioware sold us that their games give the players the possibility to make those stories yours. So I couldn't wait to play this game over and over, and explore all the different ramifications that it had to offer, but after finding out how the endings were and that we weren't really capable of modifying those things it became a very frustrating experience. This was supposed to be like "" The greatest game of the century"" and Oh boy had I known what was coming with ME3. First off the game is too linear, the story is set upon a path from where you can't diverge, and it doesn't feel like any of my actions from the previous games mattered at all. You get some benefits that don't really make that much of a difference when it comes to the endings haunted with a fleet of plot holes and bad writing. The game had some good moments I won't deny that , but what really killed it was the fact that it's fallen so low as to what it could have been. Characters' development in this last chapter of the trilogy was bad, it felt like Bioware didn't care anymore about making a good game. The romances thing were really dull and uninspiring. Also the terrible endings were a big screw you, for all of us people who loved the series and were following every detail when it was under development. I just don't know what happened, but this game as mentioned before has been dumbed down and made into a POP game to appeal the masses of people that don't even care about it, and in the process it lost its soul.

So much focus and attentionw as payed to the conversations. It is a shame, though hopelessly obvious, to see such numerous low marks are on account of a single gay male sex scene. A scene I might add, that was handled very well, was completely optional and had very obvious leads, and above all- was very romantic and well written, not a porno or anything distasteful. Mass Effect 3 is a brilliant game in all acounts, especially if you are in it for the story as I am. My only criticism would be the ending, which I have a feeling may be resolved entirely in this Mass Effect 4 I keep hearing about. This game is a strong contender for game of the year, and should win it for such bold story choices despite raising the ire of the sadly substantial homophobic community.",10,2012-03-10,PC,user
Blapper,"Mass Effect 3 is the culmination of a sweeping trilogy of games that supposedly pay off the difficult choices you have had to make and the sacrifices you have has to carefully consider. Instead, it features the single worst ending i have ever seen in a game - be it shooter, RPG, what have you - while rendering your choices completely irrelevant, as you are railroaded into playing the tacked on multiplayer to get the good endings. It's an unseemly, awful system, and whether at EA's behest or BioWare's, it is not under any circumstances acceptable. On the ending itself, whether you play multiplayer or not, it's terrible. To avoid spoilers, I will leave it at that, but I have never been so insulted to have invested myself in a game, only to be slapped in the face, like that before.",0,2012-03-10,PC,user

ME series are famous for let players choose their own story. Same thing happened in ME3, the only difference is in ME3 all ur choices and decisions doesn't count. Here is my logic, if u choose to let players have choice, u'd better respect our choices.

goblue22,"This game is absolutely AMAZING right up until the final 15 minutes or so. The end of the game is really a slap in the face to anyone who has stayed with the series from the beginning. I am not saying this because I did not get the end that I wanted. I would have been perfectly fine with an ending in which everyone died - because at the very least that would have been a clear and well defined end. This series has always been defined and advertised as character driven. The player is encouraged to get invested in and attached to the characters in the Mass Effect universe. And yet the way this game ends is simply unacceptable. The ending gives very little understanding of exactly what happened, and the player is given very little to go on in terms of the fates of the characters. I have never been one to write reviews or have strong opinions on games. I am not even one who typically gets attached to series the way I got attached to Mass Effect. But the way the end of the game seems like Bioware came up with it in maybe 10 minutes is, in my opinion, a betrayal of the fans.",0,2012-03-10,PC,user
Sk3z,"i feel sad about all this. The game is crap, and i feel fooled by the developers which ruined the story and the ending i was hoping, but mostly i'm almost angry for all those big whoop reviews by the critics. This game is just half the value of mass effect 2, maybe less. Mass Effect 2 was actually a massive game, this one is just crap. It's like they made a parody out of it. Hey, it's not a completely bad game, it's still playable, but to me it's just mediocre in everything it tries to achieve: it's a bad fps, it's not an action game and it's not even remotely a decent rpg (every skill choice is irrilevant, the game is too easy, period). In fact Mass Effect 2 was better in everything except for the shooter part, which i repeat is still not worth the money in mass effect 3. Dumbest story ever, completely uninteresting characters, no choices to make, bad outdated graphics.... This game values 5. Everyone is giving less, my guess, because the irritating aspects mentioned above: undeserved good reviews by the critics, betrayed trust by the developers (i f*****g kept mass effect 2 installed just to import the character, only to realize how worthless this was). This is an absolute let down, just an unnecessary game, which probably will get too much attention for it's value.",5,2012-03-10,PC,user

Nothing you did in the game has a result or consequence in this game, not even the stuff you do in Mass Effect 3. You can't do any major choices during the game. The combat feels like a bad version of Gears of War. The ending is horrible and makes the whole story of Shepard from the first game to the third feel irrelevant.

It isnt perfect, but its a fun game, the story falls short of the first 2, but the game play is right up there. I think the people giving the low scores are focusing their entire reviews around the few bad things about the game.

absolutpi,"Bioware has said many a time that this is a great place to jump into the Mass Effect universe. I'd disagree, a lot of work has been put into the game to reward players of Mass Effect 1 and 2. If you haven't played them you are doing yourself a disservice, and much of the game loses a lot of meaning and context to character interactions. The story is great, but unravels right at the end. The shooter aspect of the game is highly enjoyable as is the multiplayer aspect even though I tend not to be a fan of multiplayer. The graphics are middling, with some inconsistent texture quality. A high quality facial texture with a lower quality applied to the rest of the body on many models. The RPG and exploration elements of the game are a mixed bag. They've added back weapon modifications, but simplified conversations with NPCs to the point where they are little more than short cut-scenes. Exploration prevalent in Mass Effect 1 and 2 has all but vanished. You fly around star systems scanning for War Assets while avoiding reapers, but you can't land on planets except for assigned missions. There is also only a single hub world(narrative rather than combat driven location) as opposed to three or four in earlier games. Minigames and vehicle levels have been completely removed as well. A lot of this seems negative. For the most part even with all that had been stripped out its highly enjoyable. For me, it occupies a strange place in that it both delights and disappoints me at the same time.",7,2012-03-10,PC,user

moseao,"As a shooter, ME3 is passable. Not amazing, but passable. The trouble is we were all told that role playing aspects would be put back in from what ME2 turned out to be. They weren't. Not really. You get binary choices that have very little bearing on anything. You won't get a different game by making different choices. You won't even get a noticeably different combat playstyle by making different choices. Basically what happened is Bioware dumbed down the amazing Mass Effect 1 into very little more than a pure shooter. Then they figured if they just throw a couple of dialogue trees and weapon mods back in, then they can appease fans of the original. As is, there's maybe enough here to warrant a playthrough, but you shouldn't feel like you're missing much by waiting to get it used.",5,2012-03-10,PC,user

VendettaBB,"Oh man this will be difficult to express in words as I cannot seem to make a coherent sentence when it comes to expressing the devastating amount of disappointment I was subjected to all throughout my experience with Bioware's latest game: Mass Effect 3... I want to start off by saying that I found the first two games incredibly exceptional (Some didn't like 2 but I loved it in terms of its story, characters and pacing) but the third installment is quite possibly the most disappointing game I have ever played that I can think of due to the fact that I have spent so much time and invested quite a bit of emotion into this series... The choices made from previous games are simply irrelevant and very little effort has been placed into implementing the power of choice and its consequences as the earlier games did so well. The story itself, from which Bioware has built its reputation, is laughable, cheesy, predictable, and just plain infantile. It seems EA perhaps has dispersed all of Bioware's writers or they simply left to companies that were offering a higher salary because the difference in the quality of the script and story between this game and the first two is seriously night and day, I mean words cannot describe how bad the story has gotten. People have compared the story to that of a Michael Bay movie and that is not far off, although Bay atleast gives some sort of conclusion to his stories, here there is none, just youtube the ""perfect ending"" and you will see for yourself. I believe the forced homosexuality and the day-one 10$ DLC (crucial to the main story btw..) as well as the horrible multiplayer crucial to achieving the optimal ending (lets kill waves of enemies like a cheap knockoff of CoD's survival mode) have all been touched on by others here but it goes without saying that these were all decisions made without any respect or care to the fanbase that made the company what it is. Those idiot doctors sold out big-time, as if they didn't have enough money, they do not care at all about their integrity, their image, or more importantly their fans - this is a complete spit in the face to all who invested their time and money in the previous games and it goes to show the absolute corruption of capitalism seeping into the gaming industry at last. Oh and the critics? lol.. if there ever was a case of them being bought out by these giants like EA or Activision, well here it is folks, do not trust the critics, if you must - pirate the game and see for yourself but I would strongly not recommend that either simply because you will come away even more disappointed than after having read this review. And I haven't even touched on the technical aspects or the gameplay or their obvious marketing ploys which have become, as others have stated, incredibly subpar.. The overall package that is Mass Effect 3 is one of the biggest dissapointments in entertainment history and is a very very bad game - do not put yourself through the pain and agony and sadness that I did by playing this game (I even re-played the first 2 before this.....) Bioware you have fallen far indeed - DA2 , then TOR (don't get me started), and now this... Although you will keep selling, know that you have lost all the fans that made you who you are today and that you will never be releasing a quality game ever again with executives like this.",0,2012-03-10,PC,user

Mysk,"Honestly it's a fantastic game til the final 20 mins. The ending of this trilogy doesn't end with Shephard's combat or wit, but with a long cutscene that renders all previous decisions you made in the trilogy moot. The End is what bothers most of the gamers. It's out of character for Shephard, is confusing and is always ""bad"" regardless of how well you play the game. Basically skip side quests and such you get the Worst Ending, do the most you get a Bad Ending. Gameplay wise it plays similar to ME2. Combat is essentially the same, with the addition of slightly better melee capabilities. They aren't really that good even if you spec for doing melee, simply too many enemies are far to dangerous to get close to. In addition, muliplayer, despite Bioware's assurances, is REQUIRED to improve your ability to get a Not-As-Bad Ending. This may put off some who will feel that a single player rpg shouldn't be reliant on multiplayer. This time around there are no character driven side quests unfortunately. In ME2 the point was to gain loyalty, yet here there could have been SOME reason to help someone do something. Overall, the game feels rushed and is a very unsatisfying end to what was otherwise an outstanding trilogy. 5/10",5,2012-03-10,PC,user
ed103,"Short and sweet: the endings are soo badly written and contrived that it ruins the entire game. They endings do not make any sense, none of your decisions in ME3 much less other games really impact the outcome in a meaningful manner, huge holes in what's going on and why these events are even possible are present, etc... I'm not talking bad endings like say the Soprano's, I'm talking like they had to have a totally different team do the ending; like made up of marketingexecutives or something horrible.

But then there was the ending...three static choices which in no way reflect upon or base off of the other choices you've been making for the past three games, the endings give no insight towards how your choices play out (do the krogan start another war for example) and no matter your choice of ending all of the mass effect relays get destroyed. In summary, no matter your pick...everyone's dead anyway. I will never understand why Bioware choose to so intentionally ruin a perfectly fantastic trilogy. Mark my words they're going to release a 10$ DLC to ""fix"" this....",1,2012-03-10,PC,user
Rectifier,"Finished the single player campaign last night and also played the multi-player for several hours. Problems I had with the game: The time skip is confusing, even to people who played ME1 & 2. Seems like a lot of plot development off-screen that is never explained, like why does everyone hate Shepard at the beginning of the game? Has no real impact in the ME3 story arc but alienates and confuses players who, like me, played ME1 and 2, or just picked up ME3 to start with. For example, I wasn't aware there *was* a time skip until I was told by a character and that Shepard had ""done stuff"" to warrant his status on Earth at the beginning of the game. Even when you are told that its been 3 years you're like, ""Okay...3 years from what?"" I basically had to do research to even know that this was a time skip and not something entirely different. When your audience has to do external research to understand a major plot point, its a problem. Some of the decisions you make in the game have real consequences, such as letting a villain go or deciding to donate resources. One kind of these decisions are actions in conversations which are indicated by mouse clicks. This adds depth to the interactive story, but some of the choices are poorly worded, such as being nice to a specific character or a stern tone to another, and suddenly your character enters a romantic relationship... Or you just killed a side character and the verbal clue was a vague and minor disagreement... Other times these decisions require split second reactions. This is fine, but since the last time you made a decision without deciphering its intent for 5 minutes killed a person, these ""gut reactions"" actually take away from the story more often than not. Basically you're afraid to react quickly because of consequences in other conversations and can't use the system as intended. However I place blame on vague writing and lack of context for your character's decisions. The combat is decent, it has enough depth to satisfy most people and allows for wacky builds like a ""powers only"" character. Multi-player is okay but the only available mode is co-op survival, I was surprised that player versus player modes don't exist considering that the Gears of War franchise has shown 3rd person shooters can do so successfully for years. A little disappointing. Most of the talk has been about the endings for the game. I tend to agree with what appears to be the consensus that the endings are disappointing and frustrating. Considering that an RPG, even an action RPG, is defined by its story, Mass Effect 3's ending does not deliver. The game boils down to three main endings and two extra endings. The extra endings are one where everyone loses and one where Shepard chose to kill the Reapers but possibly survived. The main endings are one where Shepard kills the Reapers and dies, one where Shepard controls the Reapers but dies, and one where Shepard sacrifices himself to make everybody half-organic half-machine. He is told these choices by a hologram, who, very poorly, explains why the Reapers have been committing genocides. In fact, the hologram seems ignorant of multiple events WITHIN THE GAME that contradict his logic and states assertions on the future without any justification. The worst part is that Shepard ACCEPTS THIS. In a game about INTERACTING with the story and causing MEANINGFUL changes to the plot because of it, the player cannot argue with the childish logic spouting from the hologram and has to make one of the holograms choices. All of the choices are deus ex machina, not to mention the plot hook itself to begin with, and the fact that the hologram is the Reaper's God... The ending almost appears to be the same quality as most fan-fiction, unintelligible, self-serving, and amateurish at best. I find it hard to believe that the same studio that released Planescape: Torment or the Baldur's Gate series could fudge an ending so badly, but then again I have heard unflattering remarks about the Dragon Age sequel from last year. Conclusion: If you enjoy third person shooters with rpg elements but no story, its great. Otherwise, Mass Effect 3 suffers from a story that is an insult to intellectual thought. The main offenders are the plot holes, vague choices, caricatured personalities, and the awful ending. In any other genre I would still rate this a 6/10, but since storytelling and character development is what defines every role playing game, then I cannot give that score. Since the gameplay deserves a score of 6 and the story deserves a 0, Mass Effect 3 earns a dismal 3/10.",4,2012-03-10,PC,user

Mass Effect 3 takes the cake... DLC before it was even released, developed before the game was released and yet sold separately. Laughable endings, worse than those in DX: HR (although I can excuse those because unlike this POS, DX: HR was actually good). The whole sex in videogames that bioware are pushing is ridiculous, but in this one they also force homosexuality, to make things even more awkward and ridiculous.

The immersion was huge, but when every main character dies in a cliche or illogical fashion, you become truly sickened with the game and the company that made this abomination. Even the new characters had no life. They were just ripped from jersey shore and thrown into the game. However what truly made the game a steaming pile of **** was the Deus Ex endings. In Deus Ex the endings were amazing and original. Bioware saw this and decided to steal the ending from this game and give it explosions, a kid, and terrible writing.

I did, and was led to believe that my decisions in mass effect 1 and 2 would have implications in mass effect 3. Guess what? They dont. Have you ever wondered what would happen if an excellent cover shooter like Uncharted or Gears of War had been developed by a bunch of ****? If so, this is the game for you. The gameplay is absolutely effing atrocious. For all the money that went into this game, it feels like it was programmed by Andre the Giant slamming his spastic head on the keyboard. One button serves about 18 different purposes meaning you will die a lot. The hardest difficulty setting is too easy. The gameplay also applies to the multiplayer. Bioware decided that you can only get the best ending if you sink A LOT of hours into the multiplayer. This is them really taking the piss because the cover shooting (gone is the RPG elements, meaningful conversations and minigames from the first two games) is crap. The graphics... Everything has been purposefully darkened to hide the fuzzy details on a visual engine that is now aging very badly. The graphics will not blow you away but neither will they disgust you. They are very average. Nothing special. Remember how you could be a paragon or a renegade? That was good, wasnt it? Bioware got rid of them both now to the point where they are utterly indivisible from each other. This game is disgusting. I am very glad I rented it. Make sure you buy it used. Notice how all the professional reviewers are giving it 10/10? Also note that EA and Bioware are advertising heavily on their front pages. These reviewers are all bought and paid for. The one thing in this game I thought might be cool was that Jessica Chobot was in it. I was hoping I would be able to gun her down like the **** mutt she is but you cant even do that either. I hope Jessica Chobot gets eye cancer, aids or both. She is a talentless hack with a push up bra. Her being in this is a gimmick and that sums up this game. A bunch of failed gimmicks.

EA sets the date = 9.3.2012. game has to go out in sale. you were doing a nice job up to a month before. and then you probably saw = no more time = let's end the game as ****tiest as we can. = dumb end = dumb game. i'm telling you, game without a good ending = bad ending. i'd give a game 6 / 10, if last 5 mins weren't last 5 mins and you let one more mission in there (like say, running around the citadel, chasing illusive man, last fight with him etc..) and then that boy **** you came up with, with normal ending and satisfying animation = i'd give your game 9/10. jsut because ending would be epic = saviiour of the galaxy, also it would be emotional if you gave your life to save the galaxy, but not the way this crap of game ended. it's just hooooooorrrrriiiiiiibleeeeee. horrrible. i'm also not gonna say how much you **** up dialogues, check'd me1 and me3. heaven and earth. me1 - > lost of talking, choices everywhere, could be even better - > me 3 = yes - no, **** s**** **** horrible again. but i can't say everything is bad. i can see combat improved, yes, i'm glad it did, still not enough different enemies, saw more in me1 or me2. could have been better. you see BIOWARE ... you made 3 games where you made like 5 000 000 people who play ME series attach to the character, and expect them to give them emotionally satisfying end where you feel like a hero who saved galaxy. but you gain **** and don't feel **** it's just ****. and that animation? joker and 2 characters on some planet... WAT? what's that supposed to be? i'm really dissapointed into this. i REALLY REALLY HOPE that you will make DLC for i'd buy it anyway 10- bucks or so - which would add next things: 1. - satisfying ending (citadel doesn't explode, reapers die, shepard dies, energy beam goes over mass relays throught galaxy and destroys reapers, but mass relays stay intact) (in this ther'es like whole fleet of turians, krogans, salarians and other battlecruiser ships near earth.. how would they go back? really? ) 2. - another citadel mission where you chase illusive man, and fight him (he's supposed to be stronger then kai leng) and implanted with lots of implants. 3. more more more more more dialogue options. 4. add use of that war assets on citadel that you looked up for. 5. add more stuff to find, check, more systems. 6. CHECK 1 aGAIN! i was really disappointed in the end, and i hope if there is ever mass effect 4 or some dlc that you won't be interrupted by EA games's RELEASE DATES. because i know how it is. we would RATHER BUY A GOOD GAME, then a half product that was rushed because your publisher said so. **** PUBLISHERS and give us a good game, it's gonna bring you money.",6,2012-03-10,PC,user

souledgar,"I haven't had such an emotional experience from a sci-fi game before, and believe me, I've played quite a few of them. Mass Effect 3 is where everything in ME1 and ME2 falls into place. While not completely perfect, its still one of the best games I've played. Heres a comprehensive breakdown of what I think about the game: Graphics: Its engine is pretty much the same as Mass Effect 2's, with a small overall tweak to make everything prettier when it needs to, and bleaker when the situation calls for it. Weapons firing, explosions all have that oomph and everything looks very polished from beginning to the end. It may not have reached the standards that the latest and greatest have, but it still looks very nice. I've noticed a few texture loading issues, but it doesn't detract from the overall experience too much. Lip synch is an occasional issue as well, slightly amplified by the game's focus on dialogue, but really, it doesn't really damage the game all that much. Story I wonder why everyone hates the last 5 minutes. Personally, I thought it was such a powerful and emotional experience. I get that your 'training' didn't matter, but it IS a partial RPG game, not a pure shooter. Anyway, the whole thing was epic, powerful, and got me quite emotionally invested. Unexpected twists in unexpected places that involve unexpected people constantly kept me from being bored, and many situations and repercussions from the first two games kept the nostalgia going. There are some plot points that didn't satisfy me, but these are minor details. The ending was quite unexpected from a game like this, and personally it was quite satisfying. It does however hurt replay value, since it is quite drawn out. Gameplay Bioware seems to have taken the shooter portion of ME3 all the way. Headshots, accuracy, cover.. all the bells and whistles of the modern shooter seems to have found its way into the game. Improved AI made fighting a more interesting experience then before. There are some questionable decisions like rocket troopers and snipers that take your shield down nearly immediately, making it life difficult players who want to charge in and melee everything. The new player skill-centric combat also makes the previously useful allies less effective. Often, the only reason I take a character over another in a mission is because I believed they would have some interesting reaction to the mission (e.g. original cast in a familiar place), or, if there is no such connections, a single ability I would like to use against specific enemies, like Overload against shields. Its still fun, but its less ... Mass Effect, for lack of a better phrase. The improved AI also made some biotic skills really powerful, and some really useless. For example, in my playthrough, Shockwave has become so difficult to hit anything that I stopped leveling it, while Overload, being instant and potentially kills anything with one hit, became really powerful. I really hate the new husks by the way, they're annoying and doesn't give any sense of satisfaction. Sound Great music, great sound effects. The orchestral score, with the techy feel, adds to the impact of the whole game. No game quite moved me the way the end of the first sequence did, especially with the emotionally charged music playing. One can find that portion of the game in the free demo, just a quick fyi. Sound effects pack punch, gun fire, lasers, huge ass cannons, grenades, all explode and shoot with the oomph that one expects from a Bioware game. Voices are done very well, with the all star cast performing admirably. There is this odd need where I had to crank my speakers way up, but that might just be my setup. Multiplayer I've never really played Horde mode before, so I don't really know what most reviewers are talking about. Anyway, ME3 Multiplayer has you teaming up with three other guys to fight waves after waves of enemies. Your performance is determined as a team, how well you did, with things like not dying as bonuses, headshotting alot, using a certain weapon, etc. Its limited to a single mode, with a bunch of maps. Each wave can consist of different objectives, including kill everything, defend a point, kill specific targets, activate a bunch of nodes. Its not as exciting as a PVP multiplayer, but it entertains for awhile. It has a side goal of increasing Galactic Readiness percentage, which may or may not impact the ending you get. I'm not really sure if its possible to get the best ending without multiplayer, but looking at my own playthrough its a tall order. Conclusion Its not the best game ever made, but it certainly doesn't deserve the 1s and 2s that meta users are giving it. I liked how they took ME1 and 2 decisions into considerations, and it boggles my mind how much data it needed to take into consideration, since I'm a game programmer. In short, its a great last entry to a great trilogy. =)",8,2012-03-10,PC,user
Speech500,"I feel that i have to give a fair review of Mass Effect 3, though there will be minor spoilers throughout, but i will try not to give too much away. 1. Graphics The graphics in this game are, i am unhappy to say, just not up to scratch for 2012. Though they didn't empair my experience too much, there were definitely scenes that were nice but i know that if they were in better quality, the game would have been stunning. 2. Cutscenes I think bioware uses so many cutscenes because their textures aren't very good. Needless to say, the cutscenes are very nice, but they don't give much to the overall experience, as i can think of only one or two that looked really cool. 3. Conversations I have to say that the conversations in this game took a turn for the worse. In ME2, Shepard doesn't say anything unless you make him, this gave players a feeling that it was their character. In ME3, you are given a very mean line or a very nice line, and this gives it a bit of a Fable 3ish Feeling. These give you lots of reputation as you very rarely even get to choose what Shepard says at all. 4. Carry Over Choices Not many things carry over from ME2, Though the couple that do are just about if Ashley died or if your team died, you get a memorial in the Normandy. ME3 was more about ME3 than the trilogy. 5. The Boy This was really something i wish i could forget. Shepard obsesses over this kid right up to the ending, no doubt in an effort to pull our heartstrings. It's not like (spoiler) Mordin dying, as we know and love him. What do we care if some badly textured kid gets blown up!? 6. The End The End was..... God no... (spoilers) The player has a readiness rating going from 0 to 5000, the readiness rating is increased by playing multiplayer. At the very end of the game, the player can choose from three options, all pretty **** for the galaxy. The more you played multiplayer, the more of the tree are open to you. You can either Control the reapers, killing yourself, to make them go away; You can turn every race into cyborgs of sorts, making the reapers go away; or you can Destroy them. These three vary depending on how much you did multiplayer. If you didn't do multiplayer, you can only choose destroy, and you kill all life on earth. The fact that the single player campaign has nothing to do with the end is completely shocking, and the multiplayer addition is worse still. The endings aren't even good! I finished yesterday and I just feel cheated. 7. DLC This is an important part of the trilogy, and i am not going into why i am not happy that it isn't in the game in the first place. Though i can understand why it isn't on the disk, it should not cost me money. In my opinion, this is worth pirating, but don't quote me on it. 8. Combat I chose narrative, so for me it was EZPZ but it was also fun. As an adept, I looked forward to playing. I liked to pull people into the air and then either explode them with a throw or make Liara use stasis, making the guy just hang there for a while. It's a laugh. 9. Interface The interface is really nice and clean in Mass effect 3, something i loved. Everything is easy to do and the power system is flawless. The map is nice as it gives markers for certain places of interest. 10. Minigames I actually missed the Mining interface. It game people a reason to visit planets and explore. I just couldn't afford a lot of the things that needed researching, and i felt the research option in ME3 really went down hill. I am very happy that the Debug and Hack mini games are back, because i personally always hated the **** out of them. 11. Citadel I loved the Citadel this time around, though it was at the sacrifice at Omega and Illium. I'm not sue it was worth it, but forgetting those two, the citadel is bigger and better! Instead of the colorful techno feeling to it, there is a vibrant metropolis filled with sunshine and terrorists. It's a lovely place to go and relax after killing evil monsters from outer space. 12. Characters The characters were really well done, when you don't count the jersey shore cast... Forgetting Bioware's slip up with the romance stuff, i really felt an attatchment to a few of the characters, I.E Garrus, EDI, Liara, and Tali. not having as many people in the team was worth the fact that they really come into their own as individual people. And yes, the loyalty missions are gone, but bioware gives you a sort of loyalty mission for watch, like a central mission revolving around that person. 13. Antagonists The Baddies (Geth, Cerberus and Reapers) are really good and well defined in this game, you can tell instantly who your fighting, as each has it's own fighting styles and representatives. This was one of the things Bioware and Sata... EA did right. I'm not going to tell you which is the best, that's up to you to decide, but the information i gave you is mostly unbiased.

Lockie,"Just in a few words: this game was killed by crappy ending.. I like everything in this game, from the beginnig and up to the end. Awesome cut scenes, good writing, interesting plot-everything we loved in previous games of this series. Also, graphics and combat system were improved. It's very dynamic and spectacular. Everything was alright.. until the ending. It kills not only this game. It kills every game of the series at all. It kills every decision i've done from the first part. I didn't expected to see happy end, it would be too naive, but i didn't expected to see THIS! (Despite the fact that i had the best ending). Every ending is awful, i saw it on youtube.

Jaga,"Currently I'm about halfway through the game, and while the story is good (better than ME1/ME2), the gameplay is merely adequate. It feels very dumbed down given that there is even less customization than in prior games in the series. There is no real inventory to speak of, and when you find an upgrade for a weapon (as an example), you can immediately equip that upgrade to as many squad member's weapons as you desire. Powers are per-character, with little sharing possible via a new system. I'm not at all impressed with upgrades on skills/powers, as each feels like an almost miniscule change to effectiveness in combat. The primary reason I'm rating ME3 as a 5, is due to the unbelievable distaste it has left in my mouth having gay talk, scenes, and innuendo shoved down my throat at every turn. My assistant on the Normandy is a gay female. My dropship mechanic is a gay male. Liara is blatantly bi-sexual, and several other Asari in the story are either bi, or outright gay. There are people sitting in the local hospital talking about being gay, people in the commons talking about turning gay.. etc etc etc. It feels in fact, like there is more gay love and sex abounding in the Mass Effect 3 world than there are straight relationships. To reflect on this: I am not homophobic - I can accept that people have relationships of their choosing. But when the NORM is 10:1 (or more) in favor of straight-to-gay in reality, and you have more gay than straight in the game world, it tends to wear on you quickly. It leaves an undeniable taste of ""eww"" in your mouth, due to the staggering amount of it. All in all, a decent game - full of plenty of Mass Effect as we've known it. But a bit too much of ""hay there!"".. makes you wonder if the team writing/producing it was 80%+ gay. That part of it will not - never will, appeal to the mainstream audience. And is largely why ME3 is being blasted on Metacritic, among other sites on the web. It is one thing when it happens in moderation, and isn't blatantly flaunted in public. But ME3 really does shove it down your throat again and again, and for most straight people that does produce a substantial amount of discomfort and distaste. It isn't that it is happening, it is that MOST ME3 characters turn out to be gay. My recommendation for the game: either buy and play it knowing what is coming at you, or wait for the bargain bin price and see how much you can stomach before putting it down. It is not one of Bioware's masterpieces, and goes far beyond ""touching on taboo issues"" than it should.",5,2012-03-10,PC,user

Tangster,"The game was going great, I could forgive the little errors, the errand-shep side quests, the mediocre graphics, the day 1 DLC... all because the plot stormed along nicely and everything was going as well as could possibly be expected in a galactic war. I had the Krogan and the Turians, the Geth and the Quarians, even Aria all working together for to good of the galaxy. I'd rejoined with my LI(Tali), had fun with my bro Garrus and discovered that Shep still can't dance. The last 5 mins? Ruined the game. The ending of the game was absolutely atrocious and also killed all the replay value for me as a) had to do all the side quests anyway for the GAW thing, no replay there) b) the endings are all terribad and boil down to pretty much a single endings with a different coloured light show. Come to think of it, it killed the replay value of the entire franchise since none of my choices in ME1 and ME2 made the slightest difference in the end. If Bioware are going to end a series like that, I'll just avoid their games in the future so I don't end up with a million metric tons of steaming disappoint, especially after being so emotionally invested in both my character and squadmates before being kicked in the face by Casey Hudson's lying foot.",1,2012-03-10,PC,user

In any case, you have a very solid, playable game - that improves on the shortcomings of the two previous games. Is it perfect?

Stoneboy,"Well, what can I say? IÂ´ve finished the game yesterday (endings are ok, btw, romantic in me would have loved to have some blue children with Liara,IÂ´m not angry about them). The game itself is almost perfect (some technical bugs, badly written quest log entries...), but that almost there wonÂ´t stop me from giving it a 10. Because itÂ´s beautifully written, characters are alive and I felt (with my ME1->ME2 imported Shepard) like I was with my best friends. Garrus mission on the Citadel for example is something I will probably never forget. It was... simply brilliant. And donÂ´t listen to some people, who are trying to tell you, that the ME3 is not an RPG. It is, and itÂ´s more an RPG that ME2 was. It has weapon customization, branching skill trees and youÂ´ll be able to DECIDE the fate of the entire species at one point. Role playing is IMHO not about points or stats. ItÂ´s about making choices, and interacting with the world. All this all day 1 DLC crap is just that. I wonder what the reaction would have been if the DLC never got released and the content remained a CE exclusive. And ""autodialog""? There were one or two conversations where the extra wheel wouldn't hurt, but I suspect, that some of the dialog changes based on paragon/renegade points you get along the way. And you still make decisions, interrupts are still there... Conversations were excellent overall. So, to sum up, If you love ME, you already have ME3 and playing it. There is nothing new in it, that would stop you. However, if you donÂ´t know ME, I honestly wouldn't recommend buying ME3. Try to play the entire trilogy on the PC or X360. YouÂ´ll experience something truly special. And as I said before, my final score: 10 (or 9.75, because itÂ´s the last game, and I wonÂ´t see my friends again).",10,2012-03-10,PC,user

I'll disappoint u, Bioware, in our country only 1/4 of all gamers have consoles. Many ppl who can afford console (like me) don't buy it. U know why? Because most of console games are crap!

AbhorsenJay,"The bad: 1) Relationships were pretty rubbish 2) Jack and Miranda barely had any lines 3) You can't have a Krogan on your squad 4) Some graphics glitches Other than that, I think it was the best game in the series by far. I can see where everyone is coming from when they criticize the ending, but that is because they're basing their reviews on some ludicrously high imaginary standard. As it is bioware has put out an excellent game that is still far superior to most other games on the market right now. Other people seem to be upset because their shepherd decisions ultimately don't impact the ending - to which I can only respond - *obviously*. You're in a life or death conflict on a galactic scale. I don't see why your petty conversations should impact the fate of the *galaxy*. I enjoyed this game a lot, and the multiplayer is loads of fun. Storyline was great, had a good buildup, and handled suspense very well. My only criticism, in addition to the list above would be that I felt there could have been more.

Bioware removed the parts that people really hated - specifically, probing planets - and 'exploration' in a much less tedious way. The writing for the majority of the game was exceptional, they created a real sense of desperation, and they even made a lot of people cry in a few places. Unfortunately, it turns out that not only is multiplayer play REQUIRED in order to get the best ending, despite Bioware's promises, but the possible endings are all absolutely terrible, both in the the choices available and in the dialogue in the very final scene before you make that choice. Unfortunately, it really comes down to a deus ex machina, which is never acceptable in modern stories.

ruttunen,"In short greatest Sci-Fi RPG`s evolution to cover based action game with RPG elements that offers straight line shooting without puzzles and occasional glitches, bugs and missing puzzle sections. Not the best ending to series. First the bad stuff. Graphical bugs that show how hastily this was made, including missing walls, low quality textures, performance lowdown on bizarre occasions. Just bugs include, getting stuck on bizarre locations on bizarre conditions, falling through floor when dying, endlesly looping music on occasions etc. Removal of minigames like hacking just holding spacebar is about exciting as watching an egg boil no make that less exciting. Side quests are reduced mostly to get an item X from scanning an planet. The whole quest line is direct copy paste job from ME2 in lines of gather forces for final battle. All main quest locations are straight lines from A to B. Gameplay mechanics. The one button does all configuration does not work well I played on hardest setting and most of my deaths came from dying because Shepard was rolling between two covers facing enemies while they were blasting at him because awesome button. The talents are well what you would expect in such streamlined Action game with RPG elements. I was left with ~40 unused talentpoints because there was nothing worth putting them in. The lack of any puzzle sections baffles me its just constant pipeline fighting without any mental challenge. Even the one obivious part to use puzzles ( inside AI ) was reduced to very very very dull gun play mechanic that was about as exciting as licking week old ketchup from kitchen floor. The story is the same old thing from ME2 get your forces for last battle. The characters were mostly Good or OK, but what the hell one of the most unsatisfying ending(s) ever. I mean from the ME1 you had an chance to make something great and you went with this...? Just baffling. The whole feeling of war against more advanced reapers was OK with the whole the dark and gloomy feeling, but there was still some baffling plot holes and unexplained things. The DLC.

gregathit,"I admit to being a bioware fanboy for darn ever......until now. I was willing to over look plot holes and other issues as every game has them. But to be railroaded into the worst end of a video game I have ever heard of....inexcusable!!! This whole series has been about rallying the galaxy to fight the reapers. It has been about choices. Then at the end...none of it matters. Choose your color of pretty lights red, blue or green and by the way...everything is destroyed. Where is the button to press to kill the reapers without killing the Geth, EDI and yourself? Hell, the whole thing has space magic happening all over the place so why don't we have this option too? Why can't I have my CAKE!!!! :) The only way we who have already spent our money have to vent is by down rating this game. Besides, with the endings that are currently in place no impartial reviewer would rate this game any higher than an 80. I would gladly rate this game a 10/10 if the endings didn't **** so hard. I have lost count of how many times I have played ME1 and ME2. With the ending of ME3 I can't work up the desire to make another play through. I don't even want to play the first 2 games as I know that it is just a waste of time in the end. **** this train wreck!

UltraD00d,"Don't get me wrong, this game is playable and I'm sure if you had no standards or simply didn't care you could pick up this game and have a midly enjoyable experience. BUT the atrocities EA and Bioware committed mean I cannot give this game a decent rating with a good conscience. So what is so bad about this game? Let me tell you: 1. Day 1 DLC: Whether it was EA or Bioware (****, if you will) that decided to take this course I don't know, but releasing DLC on the day of release, particularly DLC which is important to the plot, at 1/6 the price of the game itself is unforgivable in of itself. It seems they are laughing in our face as we shell out money for something that should have been on the disc, available to everyone. It is obvious that it was done simply to milk as much money out of the fans as possible. 2. Casualisation: The game was geared towards Call of Duty players in order to cash in on the series' success, while abandoning the loyal fanbase. Not much else to say here. 3. Shoddy Writing: Many uninformed people think that the attacks on the Bioware employee Jennifer Hepler was simply a display of hate for the sake of hate. While they certainly did go overboard, it wasn't without good reason. She was the physical manifestation of the quality of writing coming from Bioware. Examples: Dialogue is awkward, the ending is notoriously bad, after seeing so many people die and killing so many himself, Sephard is emotianally effected by the death of a random kid above all. Overall you would expect something better from a Naruto fanfiction. 4. Laziness of Bioware: For a big budget, triple A game you would expect a certain level of effort from the developers. Bioware, however seemed to have taken shortcuts left, right and centre. There are images circulating the internet which demonstrate this quite well. For example, Copying a stock image for the portrait of a character who dies in the game, and copying another 7? year old image lying around in the internet for the ending. 5. Ininspired Multiplayer: Another cash-in, Wave survival modes have been done to death, nowadays every game seems to have one. It seems this was added in to artificially extend the life of the game and make an excuse for future half-assed DLC releases. 6. Gay Sex: people reading this may call 'Hurr durr homophobe"" - but wait to read my reasoning. Homosexuality IS a sin. Being implemented in such as fashion acts to 'casualise' it, pressing on the impressionable 13 year old minds (whose uninformed mothers will be buying this game) that it is fine and acceptable. I do not hate **** I care about them, just as I do any other person. For this reason I oppose it. Even if this is an attempt to cash-in with the gay audience rather than a political agenda, it gets in the way of the average straight player and does not belong. I do not want to have gay passes made to me by my squadmates when I'm playing a game. 7. Reviewers are sellouts: This goes for every major game release nowadays, but is absolutely appalling. While I'm not implying that EA is necessarily directly paying reviewers to give the game good reviews (not that I'd put it past them) there is certainly a feel that if you don't give it a good review the publisher early access to future releases. I have heard of cases where people have lost their job because they wrote how the felt rather than what they were told to write. This is why I'm writing this review in fact - to help get a bit of truth out. Instead of a proper, objective review we are fed tripe with 10/10 would play again bs. Due to all these aformentioned problems with Mass Effect 3, I cannot take it seriously, thus it receives a score of 0/10. The only reason it has earned a 1 from me is because the Biodrone tears are absolutely delicious. Have a good day sirs.",1,2012-03-09,PC,user
Ticklefist,"Great, amazing game until the last 5 minutes. People are not exaggerating this one bit.

I got the ""perfect"" ending, and it still left me feeling queasy. There are only 3 reasons I give the game a positive rating at all: 1. The universe/storyline that Mass Effect is set in is so great that even screwing it up it is still solid. 2. The length of the game is about perfect, I hate games that are too short, and this isn't one of them. 3. The ""final battle"" is great, it was very intense, and I was about to forgive all of this game's failings after it (until I got to the crappy endings).

joshjmilli,"Sure, ME3 definitely has shortcomings. The sidelining of certain crew members can be distasteful to some, and the ending itself was quite shallow for such a deeply complex narrative with a whole host of potential variables individual to each playthrough. Yet, I personally cannot bring myself to let that massively detract from an otherwise fantastic game. The story up until the climax is enthralling. The character dynamics, cinematography and writing are arguably the best in the series. The gameplay combines elements from the first 2 games to create a satisfyingly air tight cover shooter that allows for multiple play styles. And I’ll also give a honourable mention to the sound design; The Reapers just sound exceptional! In 2024, I’d be dishonest to myself if I gave this game anything lower than an 8 as a complete package with all the DLC. On the other hand, it’s an entirely different story if you’re playing without the DLC; It’s a much different, much inferior game at that point. Theres so much here that makes it far from mediocre. It’s simply another fantastic Mass Effect game that I think 100% deserves to stand on the pedestal with 1 and 2.",9,2024-12-02,XBOX 360,user

slugnutt,"I love the Mass Effect series. It's by far my favorite gaming series. Even though the RPG elements were neutered after the first game, I still love the following entries. What really, really got to me was the ending of Mass Effect 3. Specifically, it's 20 minutes or so. It's not that it boiled down to choose your own ending 1, 2, 3, 4, (red, blue, green, shoot the space kid), it's that it was absolutely awful in my opinion. The free extended ending DLC missed the point entirely. I didn't need an explanation orthem to expand on the meaning of each ending. To me, it was obvious without the extended ending DLC. I needed a great ending to an amazing series of games. I don't feel like there needed to be 100 different endings depending on the choices you made along the way. 1 amazing ending could have been enough for me. 3 or 4 different amazing endings, even better. Easy for me to say, I know. But 4 trashy throw-away endings in a game so rich with story & lore. Maybe I'm being dramatic, but at the time, it was heartbreaking. And in the moment, it nearly ruined the series for me. A long time ago, I just compartmentalized the whole thing. There is Mass Effect 1, 2 & 3 over here in this box, & the last 20 minutes over here in this box. However, to me, it's still a stain on an otherwise amazing series. A skid mark on the tidy-whities of gaming. In my opinion.",5,2024-05-21,XBOX 360,user

When a game has such a terrible cut scenes it is always an indication that it is a bad game. Made worse when they are unskipable as that show that the devs only wanted to create false playtime and waste people's time. ( to be fair, many games were made that way, and not to be repayable and infinite fun, that is because they are empty) Review from ME1 I played 3 hours then switched to Mass effect 3, to see if anything good can actually be learned from how bad the 1 started. To not waste my time. Perfect, as it did save me time, which I uninstalled before playing ( after choosing "" jump into action"") i had a 15 min cut scene without gameplay.

Not to say ilk of the rest of the game, but when you compare the beginning, middle, and end, the middle is by and large the best part of the game. This makes for a strong disconnect when it comes to talking about ME3, and really where the key problem lies in it. Everything about the middle of the game is fantastic! The continued character and world building, the established character dynamics, the choices you make from previous games effecting outcomes in this game, and really just everything working together till the finale. It really says a lot when the discourse of the end is the biggest thing people remember about the series, and while I keep trying to think of strong moments in the game I keep thinking back to how the ending was.

phoenix_prjct,"Final Thoughts: Mass Effect 3 eclipses its predecessors with epic story beats that converge the biggest conflicts bubbling throughout the series into emotional rollercoasters. Characters shine with crackling chemistry and random conversations provide smooth development and excellent pacing between big moments. Gameplay is further refined, keeping what works and ironing out the kinks for an action-focused adventure, an adventure amplified by gorgeous visuals and a tone-setting soundtrack. It’s sad, however, that from a beginning that sets a galactic apocalypse with such fantastic force and characters that can more than handle the weight on their backs, the ending feels like a completely different team of writers took control…writers that had absolutely no experience with the series. Rendering every choice the player has made moot and betraying even its core story, Mass Effect 3 ends on a bitter, unsatisfying note to what’s largely been one of the best sci-fi RPGs to hit gaming.

Filmanwalt,"The commander's journey ends. Shepard has accompanied me for a long time and again and again. With part 3, the trilogy comes to a worthy end for me! story The reaper threat has arrived, after you could still prevent entry in the Arrival DLC in Mass Effect 2, the galaxy-wide threat has now arrived. And this feeling of doom runs through the entire game, it puts you in a position to make every possible effort to take down the Reaper. This very action-packed and warlike scenario is staged by breathtakingly good missions. It's about the solution of ancient conflicts, the alliance of the individual species ... the creation of a common armed force to prevent the destruction by the Reaper. Bioware has told a very exciting story, which in the end leads to a door 1, 2 or 3 decision, but personally I am compliant with the selectable outcomes. Only the representation, albeit understandable, of the last part of the anti-reaper weapon takes a lot of getting used to (catalyst). Once again, very strong dialogues are created that really take your breath away (Tali and Legion, Liara, Javik DLC, etc.). The bond with the characters is only strengthened and you just have the feeling of fighting for something together. Gameplay The best gameplay in the trilogy. Very strong combo game play, many different skills and occasional skill options. A lot of weapons, mods and upgrades as well as some armor are fun for every tinkerer. It could have been deeper, but that was enough for me. The shooting around of biotic abilities combined with the very well-functioning squad game play is always new fun. There are also a lot of missions, although unfortunately a few of the side missions are limited to pure scanning. Here I would have liked more staging. The constant growth of the war assets makes it clear again in which position the galaxy is and must be in order to exist. graphic Atmospherically, musically, and staged simply breathtakingly. The many cut scenes in the last mission alone still give you massive goosebumps. Conclusion It is very important to play DLC again. The Citadel DLC in particular is one of the best DLC that has ever existed. But Leviathan is also very instructive.

Why? Because this just ist the least interesting game in the trilogy.. it just is.. you already know which charcters you like in this universe.. and there aren’t really anymore to fall in love with before the big showfdown.. so I just didn’t care to do the side missions, especially with just how repetitive the main campaign felt.. why would i? I had no insentive to explore and go do more.. that being said mass Efect 3 is decently enjoyable to play through.. You will get more squadmembers as the story goes on, youll be picking out their special abilities, and they do become an important part of your arsenal.. for example Liara was a stple for me to deal with annoying shielded enemies, I loved how on command I could have her just throw any enmy in the eir right in front of me.. so it really is up to you to baance your squad of 3 to your play style.. I do wish however there was more information given to me before a mission s maybe I was more throughful about the 2nd member… if I ever had anyone different it was mostly because the tory forced it on me.. in general mass effect 3 does an awful job at pre gaming… you have to chose your loadout before you go in.. having no idea what youll be dealing with ahead of time.. it makes literally 0 sense for me to not change my loadout based on my current situation on the fly… it ultimately lead to me not relly trying out any guns after I had one I was pretty satisfied… If mass Effect 3 werent the bow ontop of a series I had to see the end of after a huge investment into 1 and 2… I probably wouldn’t have been so invested to see it through.. it lies on the shoulders of the success of the perevious games and sadly doesn’t live up to the world building standards they set… While I did enjoy going through this campaign and putting an end to this intergalactic war… by itself, mass effect 3 isnt all that great.

If anything the extended cut made the ending go from bad to somewhat decent. And then you have the DLC's with the citadel Dlc being the standout one and the others all being decent side stories.

First of all, I don 't understand how the ending of the trilogy can ruin the impression of a series of games that take from 120 to 150 hours in total. Second, the main plot at Mass Effect 3 turned out to be as good as in the first part. In 3 part we solve the most important problems of the universe, finish the stories of all important characters. We get answers to almost all questions (except dark energy, which was forgotten at all. Although there were a bunch of references to her in Mass Effect 2). I can even say that I liked the ending of Mass Effect 3. The final with Extended Cut isn 't that bad. Yes in 2012, not many would agree. Apparently, emotions took over. Mass Effect 3 is the best space opera in the gaming industry, the crown of BioWare creation. And just another example of video games being art, too.",10,2020-05-27,XBOX 360,user

drlowdon,"Continuing from the events of the previous game Mass Effect 3 opens with the Reapers attacking Earth and, having narrowly escaped with his life, Commander Shepard yet again finds himself as humanity's last hope for survival. Series veterans will be instantly familiar with the games concept in which a series of core and side missions can be accessed from the Normandy's galaxy map. This time around however it is not just a case of recruiting allies to your cause. Depending on how each mission is handled vital resources, such as fleets of warships, can be gained to aid in the final battle against the Reapers. As has always been the case many of these missions allows for a great deal of freedom with a number of, sometimes very difficult, choices being afforded to the player. The series strong combat remains virtually unchanged from the series second entry and still plays like a simplified version of Gears of War. Responding to audience criticisms a number of features have been tweaked however. While the popular Mako may not make a return the weapon and armour customisation has returned and the dull planet scanning all but removed. For the first time in the Mass Effect series multiplayer has also been included. To be honest it offers only a minor diversion from the main campaign with only one mode (imagine Horde mode from Gears of War or Halo) and six small maps to play in co-op with up to three other players. Since the playing multiplayer aids in preparing for the Reaper assault in the main game however it is worth investing some time in. And so to the much criticised ending to the game. In my personal opinion some of this criticism is justified as it certainly leaves several plot holes and very much jars with the philosophy of Mass Effect. A few fans have certainly gone overboard however as when you consider the huge influence you are able to wield throughout the game the disappointing final ten minutes in no way spoils the 20+ hours that come before or the epic series as a whole.",8,2020-03-25,XBOX 360,user

gentlebenno,"Even years later folks agonize over this game and rightly so. When you take ME2 and combine it with ME3 you get perhaps the greatest gaming experience of all time. UNTIL, you get to the last 15 minutes of ME3. I can’t comprehend how the same team that made these great games decided that this was the way to end it, nodded to each other, and said it was good to go. It still baffles me. It’s probably not the worst video game ending of all time; but it’s certainly the worst video game ending of all time for a game that was actually good. Nobody who loves these games, this lore, this universe of gaming will ever get over it. When I did my last replay I stopped before the final mission, I refused to play the ending. But still, this is an incredible game, you just have to ignore the last 15 minutes and pretend something else happened inside your brain. EA daggered BioWare and ME:A was a mediocre, soulless slog, but really it’s the ending of ME3 that ended it for us all.",7,2019-07-25,XBOX 360,user

RafaelBarrera,"Mass Effect 3 is a villyfied game just because of one thing: its ending. I think it is a bit unfair to the game, the ending can't destroy the whole game experience even tho it was the close up to the whole saga ( which is why it is so hatred ). If we don't take into account the ending, this game is an improvement of what we saw in Mass Effect 2: combat system, space mining, graphics, variety in weapons, etc... The game could perfectly be a 10/10 , but as I said: the ending is horrible. It's just so mad but at the same time appreciable because of the risk the developers took ( it went wrong, obviously ), maybe it was an original idea, maybe they didn't know how to finish the saga, anyway, it's a really good game with non deserved ending. It still is a ''must game'' for me.",8,2018-11-19,XBOX 360,user
Andremax,"Mass Effect 3 shows **** with less careful than its both predecessors, whether for being a mere recicled most of Mass Effect 2's style. for having notable falling of frames on multicolored and multieffected moments, for having even more bugs, mixed with game's epilogue that doesn't gives same power of choice as on previously games. But for keeping immersive, holding, funny, with the best saga's playability and with most of the story still good, makes which game doesn't need being perfect at all but satisfying or at minimum understandeable to ending the trilogy, and ME 3 does it.",8,2018-11-10,XBOX 360,user
crusher351,"To start off, I'm going to mention something that has been said a hundred times before; the ending was weak. For all of the effort and time that I (and many others) have put into this trilogy, the ending should and could have been 100% better. However, during my current play through of the game and its DLC's, I realized something; despite having a mediocre ending, this is one of the greatest experiences in gaming. I have to say that this game had a lot of good improvements over the last two. The ability to have a serious melee attack was nice as was the ability to jump over gaps. The amount of weapons to choose from was also a nice bonus, and the customization of said weapons just added to it. The combat is improved slightly over the last game, and feels smoother and faster. The characters are back and look better than ever. Honestly, this game still holds on a graphics front today. One of the features from the last game that I'm glad they got rid of is the scanning of planets for resources. Yes, you still have to scan, but you don't have to go to each planet one at a time. Instead you scan while flying the Normandy, and if something comes up, then you go to the planet and scan it. This, despite the ending, is one of the greatest stories of all time, and just proves how good Bioware used to be.",8,2018-09-04,XBOX 360,user

SGOrion,"I just finished playing all of the Mass Effect games. The first time, I let the council die, destroyed the collector base, romanced Tali, miss all of ME3 DLC, and chose the synthesis ending. This time I saved the council, kept the collector base, romanced Ashley, and chose the destroy ending. I actually don't dislike the ending as much as a lot of these reviews do. I understand why people did not like the way it ended with three choices, but it actually makes more sense than they think. One thing life has taught us, is that you can make all the right choices, and still not have control of a certain situation. The reviews here make the mistake of assuming humanity should have 100% control over their fate because they made the right choices. While the choices they made did have consequences, such as being able to save both the geth and quarians, cure the genophage, etc, we must realize that we were never in complete control over the fate galaxy. Meeting the construct, TIM, it is he that has complete control. He is the catalyst, he has made sure the cycle has continued for millions of years, and only through his decision can it be broken. A threat that is as powerful and ever lasting as this one, is not going to be ended without some hard choices. I thought it was extremely fitting that the cycle was ended through the one who started it. The choices we made allowed us to get this far, and we must choose between the three ways that TIM believes will end the cycle. I found the emotional pieces very moving, and I thought they did a great job of wrapping up the personal endings for each character. The only thing I wish, is that after you get the ending that Shepard is alive, that there is more than just him breathing within the rubble. Mass Effect still remains my favorite games series of all time up to this point.",9,2018-03-23,XBOX 360,user

The fact that the clunky but sincere sci-fi of the original is unashamedly traded in for a full-blown action game is not what breaks the game. As I said the gameplay is fun, but the story... the story is just dogsh#t. I'm sorry, but it's true.

MarsCorialanus,"For me this game was a major betrayal. I loved Mass effect 1, even its issues had a certain charm to them. Mass effect 2 was more polished and created a much larger universe to be in. Both had amazing characters, cool ideas, and had me thinking ME would be the next Star Trek type of scifi. The world felt like somewhere you could really hang out. And it had challenging ideas about humanity and diversity and extremism. Mass Effect 3 was awful... it was dumbed down, the story felt U.S Ra Ra, and overall it spat in the face of its previous fans by giving them a really terrible pay off. What should have been an epic climax was instead a wet fart. Its not just the ending that **** by the way, the whole campaign was poorly constructed. It felt like a whole other series.

The Universe and Lore is so good, they could really establish it for a long time and make it a real sci-fi classic. Mass Effect 3 is a very good game on it's own.

Epik_Ninnja,"The culmination of the incredible sci-fi epic, Mass Effect 3 takes place a year or so after the second game. The Reapers have arrived and it’s your job to unite the military forces of the galaxy to fight them (and to help save Earth). The fate of entire species depend upon the decisions you make. Combat has been refined again to include heavy melees, combat rolls, etc. and the power upgrading system is better than ever. This is also the first Mass Effect to include any multiplayer mode. Sure, the ending was a letdown but that doesn’t ruin the whole game by any means. You can appreciate this game for its customization options and combat without playing 1 and 2, but in the scheme of the trilogy, as the epic finale to this large-scale interactive story that shows you how important characters throughout the series end up, which can vary drastically depending on your actions, it becomes something truly great. I'll admit the ending was pretty lackluster, the multiplayer pales in comparison to the single player, and there are less decisions in the dialogue this time around. These flaws do not warrant all of the low-scoring reviews. I honeslty enjoyed this game more than the second game (but just barely). I'd say it's a 9.3 (whereas 2 would be a 9.2, in my opinion). Upon playing it in 2013, it was my favorite game and still might be.",9,2015-05-22,XBOX 360,user

Tomn8er,"People who give this game a low score must be impossible to please because this is one of the best games ever made. The story, the characters, the gameplay, the graphics, the soundtrack, the replayability, this game has it all. If you liked ME2 you should love this game. It takes everything that was good about that and builds on it. The story really raises the stakes. Instead of assembling a small crew to take out a Collector base, you're assembling entire species to take on the Reapers at large. The combat has been improved and is easily the best in the series. Gone are the tedious planet scanning from ME2 and Mako-roving from ME1. The presentation, which was already stellar in ME2, is even more impressive here, with incredible cutscenes and artistic environmental backdrops that will make you say just stare and say wow as you take in the scenery. It even adds multiplayer in the form of one of the best cooperative horde modes I've ever played. Amazingly, it even stacks up well against designated FPS games like Halo Reach's firefight mode. The one thing people seem to gripe about endlessly is the ending. Having come late to the party and hearing about the general backlash, I was bracing myself for the worst... and it never came. The ending might leave you scratching your head a bit and wanting more, but it's hardly the series-ruining catastrophe many people make it out to be. The worst I can say about it is that it does feel a little rushed, it lacks some closure and perhaps there weren't enough choices. So while it is slightly unsatisfying, it hardly ruins an otherwise near-perfect game. Even the DLC in this game is well worth the money IMO. If I was to rate all the Mass Effect games overall I'd give the first an 8, the second a 9 and this one a 10. I would place the Mass Effect firmly in the top series of the past console generation along with the Elder Scrolls, Halo, and Arkham games.

GrumpySteve,"This is easily the poorest offering Bioware has given us in many a year, and by far the worst of the Mass Effect trilogy. The original, ME1, was one of my all-time favorite CRPGs. I didn't like a lot of the changes they made to ME2 so much, because they made it more like a FPS and less like a CRPG, but I was able to tolerate the changes because the story was still pretty good. Mass Effect 3 unfortunately retains and even furthers the FPS feel of the game, eroding what little RPG element is left, and doesn't even make up for this with story this time -- the story is terrible. Probably the #1 issue I have with ME3 is that, far more than the others, it felt like a game on rails. There were very few options, very few choices, and almost no cases where the ""choices"" they gave you felt like they made any difference. Gone are any real stories relating to your crew-mates. There are none of those. It seems totally random which past crew mates Bioware gives you back again and which ones refuse to re-join you. There are hardly any conversations on the ship with your crew-mates any more, and no chance to do things like learn about them or earn any loyalty. The crew stories are basically gone, and replaced by nothing -- there are no other story elements in their stead. Another problem, at least on the Xbox, is the menu system, which is absolutely horrid. For some unfathomable reason, Bioware combined the Journal and the Codex, which is absolutely infuriating - it glows with ""new entries"" even when they are only just codex entries and not new quests. The side and main quests share the same menu now, which makes for an almighty mess, and there is no ""completed"" mission menu so by the end of the game you have this list that is like 80 items tall, and the UI always puts you in the middle of it, buried in the ""completed"" missions, forcing you to scroll up 20 or 3 items to get to the active quests. And then there is the issue that they tell you what planet something is on but NOT the system or the cluster, and they don't mark most quests on the galaxy map, so you have to randomly hop around from sector to sector trying to find quest locations. This is really stupid, as the girl assisting you even says she has marked stuff on your galaxy map (but she just hasn't). This feels like Bioware were just being jerks trying to make my life harder than it needed to be. Finally, I will rant a little bit about the ending. If you've heard anything about it, you've probably heard the rumor that the ending is horrible. All I can say about this is - the haters are UNDER-selling it. The ending is absolutely terrible. I'm not sure who at Bioware thought they should end their epic trilogy with a Morton's Fork type of dilemma, but I found it very forced and very unsatisfying. Also, the explanation for ""everything that has been happening in galactic history"" was really, REALLY lame. In the end, it felt like Bioware had a bunch of different ideas, wasn't sure which one would work, half-implemented all of them, and then slapped it together into a package and called it ""done."" There was too much mindless combat, and not enough interesting conversation options in this game. It's a poor successor to the first two MEs and does not deserve to share their name. The only good thing I can say is that the voice acting is still pretty good, and the basic way combat worked was enjoyable (although HIGHLY repetitive). The game is playable, but only as a shooter. Not for the story or RPG elements. Those things, which are normally Bioware strengths, were the major weaknesses of this game.",5,2014-12-15,XBOX 360,user

Marsonra,"Mass Effect 3. This is a game that I have heard non-stop controversy over. Most people say that this game has one of the worst endings to a video game ever. Some say that it is so bad, that it ruined the entire series. I don't believe this is true however. I played the first two Mass Effect games before I played this one, and I thought they were both absolutely fantastic games. Nothing will ever change my opinion on both of those games, not even if the series completely jumps the shark. As for this game, many of you are probably wondering my opinion on it. So, is this the fantastic conclusion to Commander Shepard's story we were all hoping for, or is the ending enough to ruin the entire series? Let's find out. The gameplay of this game is very much like the other two Mass Effect games that came before it. It is an action RPG that has third-person shooter elements. This game is every bit as fun as Mass Effect 1 and 2 before it. It also adds a few improvements this time around. For instance, the omni-tool can now be used as a blade for close range combat. While you probably won't find much use for it, seeing as how most enemies must be engaged from mid to long range, it can be useful for occasional stealth attacks and one-hit-kills. Also, the game's combat is now more of a mixture between Mass Effect 1 and Mass Effect 2. It definitely takes more elements from the latter rather than the former, but grenades are now back instead of grenade launchers. Medi-gel also now works in a similar way as it did in Mass Effect 1. It is now used to restore your health as well as your squad-mates'. The game is also pretty fun outside of combat. Outside of combat, you have to talk to people and aliens in order to go on more quests in the game. The dialogue wheel from the first two Mass Effects returns here, and it is every bit as good as it was in the first two games. The only real problem I have with this game's gameplay is that there are occasional bugs and glitches that I feel like they should have fixed before release. Some of the bugs are game-breaking, but they don't occur often enough to make them feel like a big problem. Despite occasional bugs, the gameplay is still every bit as good as it was in Mass Effect 1 and 2. If you enjoyed both of the previous two games for their tight gameplay, you'll feel right at home with this game. Anyone who didn't enjoy the gameplay will likely have to look elsewhere, as the gameplay hasn't evolved too much over Mass Effect 2, despite having a couple of additions to it. As for the graphics, this is one thing that this game definitely does better over both of its predecessors. The graphics now look sharper and more realistic than they ever did in the first two Mass Effect games. Everything in this game is very beautiful to look at, and worth experiencing for this reason alone. While it is not a huge improvement over Mass Effect 2, it is definitely an improvement. As for the story, this is the part that everyone seems to hate, all because of how it ends. I'm not going to spoil the ending here, however, I will say this: the ending really is not enough to ruin the entire game, or any of the other games in the franchise before it. Yes, the ending of this game could have been better, but hey, let's be honest, it also could have been a lot worse. The story of this game is still fantastic, despite having a not so great ending. The story continues on after the events of Mass Effect 2, showing that the Reapers have now invaded the Milky Way, and their first target is Earth. You will spend the rest of the game as Commander Shepard, getting together a squad, along with the entire galaxy to fight the Reaper threat. Many plot points from Mass Effect 2 reach their conclusion in this game. Also, Mass Effect 3 has the same good and evil decisions to make as in the first two games. Since this story is every bit as good as its predecessors, the ending aside, I don't think it's fair for people to hate this game simply because the ending was terrible. Overall, I love this game. Hate me all you want, but I think this game is the second best Mass Effect game. Mass Effect 2 is still better than this, but Mass Effect 3 is still better than Mass Effect 1. The ending to this game is really the only downside to it. Gameplay: 10/10 Graphics: 10/10 Story: 9/10 Overall: 10/10",10,2014-08-27,XBOX 360,user
HPSPhoenix,"The best game in the best franchise that has ever been, and likely will ever be. Although a lot of people seem to dislike the ending(s), with the Extended Cut they're fixed. They weren't as bad as you've been led to believe, anyway. This game has better combat, more great moments, better squadmates, (maybe) better DLC and, most importantly, the best story. That's not to say it's without its flaws - what isn't? There are a LOT more automated conversations in this game, as in, there are more conversations in which you can't make choices. However, the choices you do make in this game are probably the most morally challenging and best in the entire game. If I were to count down the trilogy's greatest moments, most would be from Mass Effect 3. I would advise buying all of the DLC. It may be pricey, but it's completely worth the money.

Saqwana,i really like the game though i recognize its faults. my main complaint would the lack of different body types for Sheppard and the hands looking far older then they should with these characters. i also thin the should have been at least 12 companions in the game it would have added more variation. the lack of a solid sentinel can be an issue for some builds. the ending isn't great but i was fine with it before the extended cut. i think the extended cut adds more context to the ending which is nice. so overall it was a good solid game but not a great one.,8,2014-07-23,XBOX 360,user

HaloFever,"The ""Mass Effect"" series is the greatest trilogy of games in history, and the best games ever for the Xbox 360. The last entry, ""Mass Effect 3"", is the best of the three and a must play. Keep in mind that a majority of negative reviews are tied to the games ending, which only disappoints with respect to the series as a whole. ""Mass Effect 3"" shines in its convergence of story with gameplay. Some of the sequences are a little too ""Call of Duty"", with the cover mechanic too often negated by the liberal use of grenades on the enemy side. The shooting gameplay feels lazily developed and rather trite except the hero side has liberal use of technological powers, including the ability to use element zero to make black holes. The nicely balanced gameplay of shooting and power use makes for a fresh and exciting tactical shooter. The second pillar of the gameplay is the conversation. This is the players real chance to alter the storyline. Imagine how much more fun you could have in ""Call of Duty"" if you could talk the characters into avoiding the next explosion that blurs your vision and rings your ears. The character loyalty missions are back from ""Mass Effect 2"", but here they are bigger and necessary to win the war. ""Mass Effect 2"" was fun, and self parodying, but ""Mass Effect 3"" is the grown up version, where Shepard doesn't go on missions just to get laid.",10,2014-07-16,XBOX 360,user

tmims44,"People complain about this game far too much, since they updated the ending this game has become a full fledged conclusion to the trilogy instead of the **** third child it once was. the game play from 2 to 3 was much improved and the online multi-player was non-stop fun (provided you will need to have at least 1-2 friends in your life to enjoy it) Best game of the series by far.

SipauFade,"All aspects of the game are improvements from the previous 2 games. Combat is as rewarding as some of the other traditional shooters. The stories strength lies in it's subtlety, which allows the gamer to truly personalize the game. I felt the ending to be inspiring because it was open ended enough to allow me to fill in the blanks and place my own personal motivations and beliefs into the story. It is sad the game caught such a bad rap for the ending. It actually effected my perception of the game when i initially played it. Now that I've come back to playing it, I appreciate it more for what it is. An amazing achievement in storytelling, game play and taking chances with an audience even if they aren't ready to be challenged.",10,2014-06-27,XBOX 360,user
Deusex,"One of the best series I've played, and its Epic last game. (of the trilogy) basically for this review im gonna add the things it does well and the things it does bad. if you want anything about gameplay, check out my Mass Effect 2 review. Pros: - Amazing Backgrounds during battle. - Reapers feel real, and a like a real threat - more customization - great last two missions - a bit inspirational. Cons: - That Ending lol. - Too much like 2 in terms of gameplay. - Some returning characters, you cant interact with them as much as you wish. Why cant i convince Miranda to join my crew again? etc.",9,2014-06-14,XBOX 360,user

It looks great, the story is so tense all the time, but at the same time you can chillout. It still felt like I made strong bonds with characters, like in Mass Effect 2, which is always a plus for me. This is still a 10 for me, cause everything was still so well done.

Better combat and better story. I loved the ending by the way, it wraps up the trilogy well, and I was satisfied with it. I see all of these people saying they were fans of the trilogy, but gave it a 2 for the ending.

Jenkins,"An improvement from Mass Effect 2 in many ways. However I can't help shake the feeling that many of the plot-points should have been over and done with by this point; the result is a story which is inherently better than Mass Effect 2, yet feels bloated having little room to breathe. Regardless this is as epic as games can get and -- despite an ending which could have been handled a little better -- it really isn't too difficult to see why this trilogy defined a gaming generation.",8,2014-05-03,XBOX 360,user
AJ_antipop,"Is the ending disappointing? Yes, very much so. Does that alone make this game awful as a whole? Absolutely not. The characters are all still just as likeable, the dialogue is top-notch, the graphics are both gorgeous and fitting, and the majority of the plot is incredibly intense and riveting, not to mention the gameplay (mainly gunfights) remaining fun, accessible, and dare-I-say, perhaps even a bit more challenging than before, with the inclusion of many new difficult and powerful enemies. Overall, this is still an excellent game, but the ending (even with the free DLC) does hinder it a bit. I can certainly see why people were so mind-numbingly upset before the DLC came out, as the original ending has an extreme lack of details. I'd still recommend it to fans and anyone who likes RPG's and/or shooters, but BE SURE to download the DLC Ending, as I feel that's part of the reason I wasn't as furious as many others.",8,2014-04-15,XBOX 360,user

S0me_Guy,"GOOD: Great story(obviously, it's BioWare); Awesome and funny characters and the game did a great job of making me care about them; Fixed the terrible ending and 2 things you'll notice after seeing the new ending: first, most of the choices you made in the past games and this game actually matter and second, it shows how BioWare cares about their fans by making a new ending that the fans deserved; All of the notable characters in the past games at least make a cameo; improved and faster combat system; No more class restrictions on weapons; New romance options; New and better weapons; New weapon customization; Added new powers to use and all are good; New Gears Of War type of melee animations; New stuff to buy at shops; New and improved leveling system(like a combination of the leveling systems of the first 2 games); Your ship is larger; Reapers have been added to the galaxy map; Throughout the game, you'll gain war assets which will help the final mission; Awesome boss battle with a Reaper on Rannoch; 35-40 hours campaign; Tons of replay ability with multiple classes and being good or bad(just like the past 2 games); Surprisingly fun multiplayer with playing as different races and teamwork is important(level capped at 20); Free multiplayer DLCs with new races, upgrades, weapons, enemies, and maps BAD: The original ending got me pissed off(thankfully they changed it); The Prothean was on a day one DLC(bullcrap because that is one of the most important characters of the entire series); There is no final boss battle; No space combat(even though there are cutscenes of your ship in the middle of huge space battles); Can't use the Hammerhead vehicle which was the best in the series; Character customization is still not that good FINAL VERDICT: This game is amazing with a ton of improvements, it does have problems but the game itself is great. I was going to give this game a 9/10, but BioWare actually care about their fans to make a new ending which is why it will end up as a 10/10. If you are an action game fan or an RPG fan, you must own this game forever. In my opinion, it is the best game of 2012!",10,2014-04-07,XBOX 360,user
ProximateXbox,I absolutely love this game. it is completely story driven with great character development and epic gameplay. It is also the only game I think I have ever released emotional feelings about as the story and the dire situations kept me engaged at all times. I honestly believe this is the best game I have ever played. as It was more compelling and engaging than any other game I had ever played. I recommend this for any sci-fi fan. but to actually get the absolute true experience they must play the first 2 games. and perhaps they will get the same feeling I had when I completed this one. The people at bioware know what they are doing and I'm extremely excited for Mass effect 4.,10,2014-03-13,XBOX 360,user
DragonBall,"I won't go into detail, but I have to say this: the ending of Mass Effect 3 is easily the lowest point in the trilogy. The Extended Cut DLC makes it better (I recommend you download and install that before playing), but even then it's still a low point. Other than that, it stands up to the high bar that the previous two games set. However, just like with Mass Effect 2, I recommend that you play through ME1, transfer your save to ME2, then transfer your ME2 save to ME3. It just makes the game that little bit better. The Mass Effect trilogy is an absolute must play.",9,2014-03-13,XBOX 360,user

Then there was the Day 1 DLC with Javik, the complete failure to get Talimancers like me to shut up with Tali's lazily photoshopped face, and the watering down of the third to make it a 3rd person futuristic Call of Duty game. But... I still loved this game. So much awesome... even if the action is overdone, it's still awesome. Game Play; fantastic. Soundtrack; fantastic. Characters; fantastic.

Seamus100,"Overall I enjoyed this game and the prior series. I've played it multiple times as a new game and importing a previously played character from ME1, ME2, and ME3, and as a male and female, and that had full Paragon and Renegade so I got my moneys worth out of it. What I found disappointing is that not all of the choices I made in ME1 and ME2 affected my ME3 character. For example: I know I destroyed the Collector base, but in my imported game it said I saved it, and the illusive man even mentions it in conversation that I saved it, but I know I destroyed it. I also didn't like they way they changed the look of Ashley! She looks like Miranda. I didn't have a problem with the graphics or sound. I think they were good. I don't recall if there was music, but if so I usually turn off the music in my games so I can't comment on it. I bought and downloaded the weapons packages only to find out that in some of the missions you get better ones, like rescuing the student on the space station (where Jack is teaching, if you saved Jack) so that DLC was a waste of money. The searching for minerals was rather tedious, but better then ME1's way of collecting them. And the other DLC missions should have been part of the game or at least free to download/add on. I'm really torn between giving this game a 7 or 8. I'd like to give the game a 7.5. Maybe I'm cheap, but I'm going to give a 7 just because the DLC weapons, additional uniform, and mission should have been part of the game or available for download.",7,2014-01-03,XBOX 360,user

The game might as well have said ""what colour would you like the destruction of the universe to be?""

huss2215,"Graphics: The graphics are starting to look a little out dated but there are moments where they look amazing. Mostly when there’s blue lighting. 9.0. Sound: Professional Bioware voice acting as you know it, themes were great. 10. Gameplay: The gameplay feels a little more casual than usual, although it is very similar to Mass Effect 2 (at least for my character). RPG elements are similar, but the game doesn’t need any tweaks, it seems just fine. The problem with the gameplay is that it gets way to repetitive, and I went ahead and did every mission available. It feels like a chore at times, and some moments that are meant to be scripted events, look only decent. In my opinion they should have left the scripted events to the professionals at Naughty Dog, but there are still okay moments, but nothing that will drop you out of your seat. Mass Effect 2 was better in almost every way. The way the game builds relationships is a lot more strict than in the previous game. Still with some of those cons, Mass Effect 3’s gameplay is still a must play, especially those like myself who transferred their saves since the first title. 8.5. Story: The story was a pretty good story, and near the ending it did get ridiculous but it was still okay. I didn’t really understand all the outrage just because of the ending, it was still a proper way to end a trilogy assuming that was Biowares goal. 8.0. Lasting Appeal: The game is still worth the buy, I clocked almost 30hours, doing everything. 10. Overall Score: 9.1 out of 10.",9,2013-11-14,XBOX 360,user
KotorFan3231,"This is definitely one of the best games i have ever played, and personally one of my favorites of all time. The story and characters are above average in fact they are the best i have ever seen in any game to date. There is so much emotion in the dialogue, the action is intense, well presented, and cinematic. The choices your character makes are more impact full. There is one instance in the game i won't spoil for anyone but it involves the Geth, and Tali, and one of the choices made me feel so much emotion i almost cried. Fortunately i ran into very little glitches. My personal favorite character from this game other than commander Shepard is The Illusive Man voice by Martin Sheen, he is well voiced, and character is well written. Now the only other problem with the game that i found was there were less companions, but each were interesting so that didn't bother me that much. For the people who say the ending ruined the game it didn't yes the original ending did not solve much it was just inconclusive but did not ruin the whole game. The ending did not interfere with my experience because overall the writing was extremely strong. There is a massive amount of content in this game. It took me Thirty plus hours. Overall i give this game a Ten, and it does not mean that the game is perfect it just means the pros far outweigh the cons.",10,2013-11-12,XBOX 360,user
Masters_Che,"Mass Effect 3 is the epic conclusion of one of the most ambitious, memorable, amazing stories in modern media. The lore is rich, but relatable and accessible. In this, the 3rd installment of the trilogy, Commander Shepard (the protagonist) is tasked with confronting a massive threat to the galaxy while being tasked with forging tenuous alliances with other races that aren't on the best terms with each other. Compared to earlier Mass Effect games, the combat has been refined. The controls feel responsive and crisp. I no longer felt as though Shepard was dragging a piano behind him as in previous games. You're also able to roll, which makes a huge difference in this game given the faster paced combat and more intelligent AI (e.g. they will flank you and bust you out of cover). In addition, power combos have been enhanced. To me, it's one of the things I love most about the game play. You have the ability to inflict more damage by hitting an enemy with a particular power (e.g. telekinetic/mystic, tech-based and grenadier for the uninitiated) and then following up with another special power that creates an effect that adds more damage and potentially causes collateral damage to nearby enemies. In addition, I really enjoyed seeing how the story arch does take into consideration your choices from the previous installments. While some of these past choices only affect minor aesthetic aspects of the experience (e.g. you see some generic character in a particular role than a character from Mass Effect ""one""), others have implications that extend to the epilogue (e.g. the fate of a particular race). Be warned, if you've grown to care about any character from these games, then you will cry. Often. Most of these tears can be attributed to direct shots to your heart via non-exploitative nostalgia and very touching/tender moments. The music score in this game is epic. Clint Mansell (frmly Pop Will Eat Itself, Trent Reznor buddy, Grammy nominated composer of the score from ""Black Swan"") lends his talents and provides some of the most heart swelling pieces I've ever heard. Not to mention the amazing talents of Sam Hulick. I cannot tell you the number of times I've listened to the main soundtrack.... As for the technical aspects: Great graphics and sound. Yes, there are the occasional texture pop-in issues (which can be minimized by installing the game) and the odd glitches that range from peculiar to downright unnerving. There's one glitch that I consistently encounter in the game with every play thru that played a role in me scoring the game a 9 versus 10. It's not game breaking, but more immersion breaking. It doesn't last long, but it will haunt your dreams... Overall, the critical/story advancing missions where fun and fast paced; however, I wish there were more opportunities to explore as opposed to being compelled to push forward. While in retrospect, I've regarded the Mako-based missions from the first game to be a bit tedious; having played through it again I have to admit that I kind of miss them and the sense of scale that being able to explore a sandbox brought to the experience. However, one has to weigh that against the overall sense of urgency that the game creates, both inherent to the plot and with nice little music tricks (e.g., more frantic movements in the music which gets your heart racing). Side quests for the most part, are relegated to ""Fly here, scan this planet, collect item, bring back to someone in the Citadel"". This was a truly missed opportunity to have more fleshed out missions and combat. Also, War Assets, gained by completing missions and helping other races' militaries/leadership, are a pretty neat way of ensuring people complete as many side quests as possible to get the ""best ending""; the threshold for getting the ""best ending"" is easily attained. This is especially true if you play the fantastic, though simplistic multiplayer, and if you play any of the DLC. While speaking in superlatives about this franchise has become esoteric controversy w/in the more ardent rank and file within the Mass Effect fanbase, ironically, these words are the best way I can express my opinion of this game and the franchise overall. Despite some of its short comings, I was more than satisfied with the experience, from beginning to end and I highly recommend it. IMPORTANT NOTE: Make sure you have the Extended Cut downloaded. It makes a huge difference in the ending of the game so I would say it is **** it's free. Furthermore, though not essential, I recommend that ""From Ashes"", ""Leviathan"" and ""The Citadel"" DLCs be purchased. These are fantastic pieces of add-on content for those who can't get enough of the lore and character interactions. Omega is an ok piece of DLC, but it feels more like an option than any other DLC in the franchise.",9,2013-10-09,XBOX 360,user
DeathtoSpongify,"This game is the best possible way the Mass Effect Trilogy could have ended. Although the characters and story are so nuanced that it takes a player with a real attention to detail to get the full experience, this game has very few shortcomings. At the outset, ME3 impresses with solid mechanics, great visuals, and carefully executed dialogue. This really is the best combination of shooter and RPG that I have ever seen. The game takes great care to make your character feel like yours, moreso even than games like Skyrim or Oblivion. When played to the extent to which it was intended, Mass Effect 3 offers deep sentimental attachments to a multitude of characters, as well as a story that, although slightly predictable, is so involved that it is rendered unforgettable.",10,2013-09-20,XBOX 360,user

I could ramble on about the great graphics, intuitive game-play, and fun multi-player, but I will not, as that would distract you from the greatest draw of the game. It is a literary masterpiece, an epic of our times. Full of rich characters, grave loss, and hope. (Think Braveheart) . Many people dislike the ending to the story, much as many despise the classics of literature. I think the main cause of this is that the ending fills you with grief, something very few games can do. The fact that it causes you a negative emotion in the first place shows that there is literary power here. This is not game of the year people, this is the ending to the series of the decade.

miramax123,"At first, I gave this game a 9 for the fact that the music wasn't as rushed as ME2 majority of sounndtracks, for their aesthetically-compensating atmosphere, the moderate depth in characters' feelings about the Reaper War and the improved gameplay movement, flow, speed and resolution, although the power recharge system is still there which was kind of a bummer since ME2 you can't constantly use powers without having them all charging just to use one power. And the soundtracks were absoulute emotional originality! However, despite thinking and thinking more about how MUCH potential this game seriously had, I realized that the EA gaining full control of the franchise after ME2 was just middle finger to veteran fans and a cynical step TOO FAR! The flaws are established; The villains weren't at their most authentic evil, like Kai Leng, who I thought was a superficial rather than a dangerous assassins, Harbinger not getting enough establishment at all, Sovereign was by far the most terrifying verbally and villanous character in the trilogy from ME1, no planetary exploration and instead like ME2, you get an even worse and less captivating side missions just to prolong the original game time, storyline was the main crap that was a bloody punch to the face by Bioware to all of us ME fans, the vaguely rushed, inexplicable and confusing endings were just a mockery to the entire trilogy!! Bioware needs to get their magic back that once manifested in ME and ME... ME3 just had NO diversity in missions, not enough ndifferent enemies, and the most ridiculous of them all, is on the Insanity mode, you instantly get cheap deaths by three randomly stupid husks and a ridiculously annoying Marauder shooting at you while your Shepard is annoyingly shaking from the targetting system, preventing you to kill that last idiot! Bioware just shoved their heads down with EA, not enough impact from decision making from the previous ME and ME2 decisions, although the Javik and Citadel party DLC's were fun, this was just overall bullcrap to me.

This game, no this series, is the pinnacle of video games inception into mature, well thought out story telling and emotionally jarring character building. The tension and the moral choices, combined with the stellar voice cast and excellent writing, help center the finale of this game series with a bang, creating some of the hardest decisions that I have ever made in any video game. I literally cried when both Garrus and Tali, who I had gotten very attached to, died in that final rush, an result to the well put together characters, and the bonds that you gain with them. The ending, while similar either way, ties the series up beautifully, and on top of that, possibly TOPS the last two. When I say that, I am mostly referring to the lack of customization that you are all complaining about in the ending from the vast amount of choices you made. To be totally honest, you never really saw the results of your choices in the previous games, until you played the next one.

And this is why it is so astonishing how the final sequence is all it takes to make this very good game into a very bad one. All the excitement that had been building up over the course of the game, and also it's two predecessors, is extinguished immediately and in the worst way, leaving you with the inescapable feeling of being ripped off. The worst part is that there is absolutely no closure to any aspect of the story. The ending didn't just ruin Mass Effect 3, it ruined the entire series. For this, I can not justify any other score.",0,2013-07-02,XBOX 360,user

shprea,"Mass Effect 3 takes everything that made the first two Mass Effect games amazing and refines them to a tee. The gamplay is an improvement over the already improved Mass Effect 2 gameplay. The music is just as grand as the other games. The graphics are sharp with barely any technical issues. The story is compelling, full of victorious, sad, and memorable moments. Really, this game has it all. Many complain about the ending of the game. While I believe the ending was a little disappointing, it's not worth giving the game a 1/10 over. Really, the ending is the only minor flaw with this game, thus bringing it down from a perfect score. Still, this is a fantastic game worthy of everyone's attention. 9/10",9,2013-06-25,XBOX 360,user
shaun8pickles,"I LOVED this game, and I LOVE this series, and it so sad that people on here writing reviews (most of them writing their first review?) are still complaining about the ending. I have played through this series 3 times. I have had a fair share of hours in this series. It's not fair to review its game on %1 of it package. Mass Effect 3 has everything, the lip syncing in this game is amazing, the gun-play is awesome, the monsters are better than ever, and the soundtrack is memorizing. I am and always will be a fan of this series. And its sad to see ""so called fans"" review this game on just its ending, they really did everything they can to fix it. The Extended Cut DLC was great, and real fans wouldn't ditch a game just because of one thing. Seriously, this game has it all for space fans.

endings,"I think what hurts this game most is its own hype. By being the final installment of a trilogy, it has a tremendous amount of pressure to tie all loose ends and satisfy story arcs so that gamers will be whetted for a new hero and new series. If one plays this stand-alone, which I think is a ridiculous idea, but the game is set up to accustom one for such a scenario it would rank much higher. But as part of a set and the end of that set, it grades lower. The ending, is such a punch, It really robs the whole theme of the trilogy, perseverance. There was an attempt to fix it, and it works for some, not for others. There is good here, it doesn't deserve the absolute bottom of the barrel scores. The Multiplayer gets little mention but has a lot of options as far as if you play an alien, guns, level buildup.

I liked the campaign, because once again it had great characters and side missions that weren't delivery missions, but without ripping apart its ending, Mass Effect 3 doesn't have the same appeal as Mass Effect 1. It seems that they're straying away from its original RPG elements and becoming more of a tactical shooter.

Johng4,"This is the first mass effect game i have ever played. In short i like it. I have not officially beaten the game but i have played it enough to get the gist of how the game runs. One thing so far i do not like about the game is i just hit disc two and i have done two sections so far in the game where i actually get to shoot things, in between that time are two very long and drawn out parts where you talk to people on the citadel to recruit new members for the alliance and get resources for the war and get to know the characters, at first i didnt mind then i thought,, hmm i wanna shoot stuff. And the shooting and combat is something i really like about this game its fluid fast and fun and you have alot of options going into batlle. You have your standard stuff like guns and stuff but you also have powers and abilities as do your aliies which you can direct them to do at any given time after the cooldown. The story is good even to someone who hasnt been with the series for the whole ride it does a decent job of getting you up to speed of whats going on, since i havnt played the other mass effects(yet) its safe to say im not getting the whole experience because im pretty sure if had played one and two my decisions in those two games wouldve made the experience completeley different for me because thats how things work in mass effect, your desicions.

The game has done things right: graphics, soundtrack, combat, multiplayer, these ""touching moments""... yet it still fails to satisfy completely. Some important story-arcs are completely cut off, certain characters were simply dismissed, side-missions are almost non-existent, the writing is laughable at points and (this has already been discussed to death) the terrible ending happened.

Settlestone,"To start off, I've yet to reach the ending of mass effect 3. I assume I'm getting close, 24 hours in or so. I had an idea a month or so ago to play all three in a row, because I forgot what happened in the first two games. So I replayed through the first, loved it, damn fine game. Replayed the second, also sweet, got a bit bored of the planet scanning after awhile, but besides that highly enjoyed it. And then I started 3. I don't honestly understand how this game got such a high review. The entire system was dumbed down, all mini games removed, almost all exploration removed, no characters to gather, silly dream sequence scenes that always end exactly the same. Canned dialogue, removal of REAL side quests and a new, insanely annoying combat system where every single npc strafes at Mach speed. There's so much wrong with this it's hard for me to find anything fun, new or cool. I have no desire to finish the game, Ashley looks like a man, all of my companions are boring, oh, the one binary puzzle level was sort of neat albeit a tad frustrating. As I said I played each concurrently, the second I finished the first I started the second, same with second to third.

Vanadium,"This is a very good game, and has been exposed to far too much negative publicity. It has been a brilliant series, and this is a very good continuation of the Mass Effect trilogy. The gameplay is better than any previous installment, with good graphics and some missions being very well executed and thought out: Tuchanka and Rannoch in particular. That said, the lack of more conversation decisions, and less squad members, as well as the now infamous ending might plague the game somewhat. The multiplayer in itself is very addictive, a fun Horde mode where the main problem is an infuriatingly unlikely random store, which seems to be an excuse for those dreaded microtransactions.

EWD,"In an industry of the quick one-liner shooter and linear choice rpg I find it good to see some writing power being put behind a game to give it more of a endearing and drawing in quality. Mass effect's universe has always given players more in the way of choices, relationship development and Mass effect 3 has now promised to give us the fruits of our labor. I come to really enjoy every person I meet in the game and the inspired locations in it and It did make me feel as though what I did in the game's shaped the universe around me and most popular games just don't give you that, really doesn't. Now my thoughts on the linear endings is that for me I was playing for the in game experience and I knew that there would be more games and like past games in the series I never really see the ""end"" as a final game and I didnt expect developers to have the time to come up with hundreds of different endings for every choice we made, though they shouldn't of promised that but its a mistake people make them.

Mothman13,I'll start right off the bat that Mass Effect 3 is a good **** isn't as good as Mass Effect 1 & 2 and as a final part of Commander Shephard's story it doesn't fully deliver.

Auritone,"I... What... This is... I can't... (adopting James Earl Jones voice) NOOOOOOOOO!!!! There simply aren't words that can adequately describe how incredibly disappointed I was with this title. The sheer dumbing and scaling down and utter contrived nonsense of this game simply defies belief. To summarize: The conversation wheel is reduced to mostly two choices, which most of the time are just verbal variations of the very same choice. The Citadel has been reduced to four very small ""rooms"" which make you feel like you're in a dorm rather than a huge construction floating in space. The story makes little to no sense what so ever (and that's well before one of the worst, most contrived, horribly written, and senseless endings in the history of writing). Side missions consists primarily of Shep playing UPS-guy. Here's how it works: Eavesdrop on total stranger, go to system, scan planet, find object, go back, deliver found object to total stranger, the end. And if you thought Bioware couldn't make scanning planets more absurdly boring than it was in ME2 (where it actually served some kind of purpose), then you're in for a surprise. Imagine playing Tetris with only square blocks which take up the entire grid. That's scanning planets in ME3. You don't really do anything. The shooting levels are extremely linear and makes the whole game feel more like an attempt at a Gears of War clone with longer cutscenes (and a still dysfunctional AI) than Mass Effect. Oh, and did I mention the sheer amount of auto dialogue? Then there's Tali's face... Oh God, how lazy can you get? Then there's the IGN chick. WHAT!? And then there's the ending... You know, the one where all the decisions you made throughout the three games come together and gives you a plethora of different endings? Well, no! No choices you ever made make even one iota of difference. Everybody gets the same three completely ridiculous, contrived, senseless, and grotesquely illogical choices of endings. Remember we were told that the Reapers were beyond human comprehension? Well, it turns out they were right. Noone can possibly comprehend the assenying, senseless stupidity which is the Reapers and the Catalyst (or smurfboy aka deux ex machina). To sum up: Mass Effect 3 is a boring 3rd person shooter with long cutscenes and a completely senseless story and one of the worst conclusions ever in gaming history. The only reason I can swing my way up to a four, is the production value which is excellent and the fact that there is actually two missions in this game that has the old Mass Effect feel of choice and consequence. But twice simply isn't enough when we consider that was the whole premiss of the game. The story of the Mass Effect franchise is the story of how game companies all now seem to aim for the lowest common denominator (aka ""as long as I can shoot stuff and don't have to actually think or do anything, I'm happy"") rather than aim for excellence.",4,2013-03-14,XBOX 360,user

Lieber,"Mass Effect 3 is both a testament to show how low EA has dragged Bioware. On the other hand, it IS a good game. Graphics look great, the RPG elements have been improved and the general gameplay is great. You can pretty much cut ME3 in three. Average/Amazing/Bad, for Opening/Majority of Game/Ending. Even with the Extended Cut, the ending is not satisfying for long time fans of the series, and it's really a shame. Other issues include tons of auto-dialogue, a focus on Cerberus instead of the Reapers and the fetch quests they replaced normal side quests with. Your ME2 squadmates are completely sidelined, but that is Mass Effect 2's Suicide Mission's fault. So why did I rate it 8/10? Because it is a good game. Just not a great Mass Effect game.",8,2013-03-09,XBOX 360,user
Gargus,"I'm not here to rip on ME3 just for the sake of doing so or because its what's cool to do on the internet like so many others. Basically ME3 is the worst of the series in every way possible compared to the other 2 games because it doesn't build or improve anything. It simply just tries to hurriedly finish the series for the sake of a cash in on the title. 1- There is no sense of exploration. The game as efficiently as possible holds your hand every step the way and has you actually being on the ground doing things the least amount possible. Side missions are carried out by quickly scanning a planet ala ME2 and then firing a probe. That's it. You don't explore, you don't get to check out uncharted worlds simply for the sake of curiosity or anything. Scan, shoot probe, side mission done all without even leaving the galaxy map. This tactic accounts for the majority of side missions. ME1 you could explore the galaxy drive around in that horribly handling buggy and had a sense of discovering things, ME2 you could land on planets and explore doing side missions with some not even firing a single shot like the crashed cruiser balanced on the mountain peak but all of those things are gone in 3. The game just holds your hand and ushers you from mission to mission. 2- You don't get to actually chose anything, everything is pre determined for you. Even if you chose the renegade or paragon path you get the exact same result and no one treats you differently and you get no alternative paths depending on your karma scale which makes it all incredibly pointless and just window dressing for the fact the story is entirely linear and so is your character. 3- The characters are all the same ones, only less compelling. There are a couple new characters but they are highly disposable and not even worth messing with. James for instance is basically just a guy who talks 90% of the time like a generic white guy, 10% of the time he throws out some Mexican phrases like saying ""loco"" a lot in his generic white guy trying to impersonate a Mexican guy and he looks like he was taken from the show jersey shore. When a old character returns you can see it coming a mile away. For instance you go into a area where the mission briefing talks about geth then you can see 45 minutes before which old character is going to come back. All the characters themselves seem hollow and rushed, they lack the personality that made them endearing in the other games and most are there only long enough to be overly obvious in a very specific mission or they simply show up for 3 minutes of camera time practically winking at the player with a nod and then are gone. 4- The story compared to the others ****. The other games had side stories, character stories, side missions with their own short stories and so on. ME3 on the other is basically this ""Everything is going to be destroyed"". That's pretty much it because no matter where you go or what you do its always about the war specifically and nothing else. I also got sick of hearing phrases like ""were here to save lives"", ""were doing this to save lives"", ""this weapon will save lives"", ""we need to stick together to save lives"", ""billions of lives are on the line and were here to save them"", etc and after about 8 hours I was sick of hearing about the war and saving lives. 5- The game play was basically just one big shooting gallery and hiding behind chest high walls. Every single fight is basically you hiding behind chest high walls to peak out and fire a few rounds only to hide back behind said wall. It was incredibly boring and has been done to death in dozens of other games. The combat was mindless and mediocre. It felt like they put absolutely no effort into the combat at all and rushed you through it in order to get to the next scene of hearing Sheppard say ""saving lives"". 6- The ending was atrocious. This is a series that prides itself on story, characters and dialogue. We all spent over 100 bucks playing all 3 games and spent over 100 hours playing all 3 games but bioware seemed to say ""This is the end of the trilogy so who cares about the ending"". The ending is the most important part of any story of any kind because its the very last thing you leave the person with and its supposed to be a reward, the climax to everything leading up till then, basically the ending is the most important part of any story. But the ending of ME3 was over in just a minute or so despite the dozens of hours of dialogue, cut scenes and story in the rest of the series they got lazy at the end. It gives no satisfaction at all. I can honestly say it is the laziest segment of the series. I did like though they had the balls to do what they did with Sheppard, but the ending still **** and doesn't make you glad to have finished the series.",1,2013-03-07,XBOX 360,user

Originally everyone was skeptical about the mutli-player component, but with an assortment of free DLC associated with it you can't go wrong playing some Mass Effect co-op with friends.

Tofusin,"The end to a Legend. Mass effect 3, the conclusion to the story of Commander (insert first name here) Shepard. Been a hell of a ride, from Eden Prime to Omega, and everywhere in-between. Mass Effect 3 beings after the events of the Arrival DLC for Mass Effect 2. Cmdr. Shepard having been arrested, and facing trial,on Earth, is interrupted with the Reaper's invasion. And Shepard is given one final mission: Unite the Galaxy to combat them. No easy task, but years have been spent for this very moment. Shepard is faster and stronger now. With combat rolls, cover vaults and devastating melee attacks. He/She is joined by a smaller (But more vocal) squad. All previous squad-mates, main characters from previous games return. Though some are placed in corners, and given little screen-time. The weapon crafting system is a fun little addition, even if you won't be using it much. The mining mini-game is gone, (Hurray!) and planet scanning is simplified. The game leads through many emotional moments, some of anger and hate. Others of happiness, and joy. But the leading is pressure, desperation and tragedy. Keep tissues near you for this game. A work of art for 99% of the **** you've heard it a million times.

This could easily be a Mass Effect 2 expansion pack as it plays, feels, and looks just like the previous game. And although this would seem like a good thing, the story is now bogged down by too many chance encounters and contrived story telling. I don't want to by chance run into everything character I ran with in the previous game in a massive universe unless it makes sense to and ME 3 forces me to see my fellow squad mates in the most random and coincidental ways that it makes it all feel icky. The game has been replaced by all out action which will keep some people happy. It just lacks the heart of the first 2 games.

MetalTree,"Personally, I don't quite understand all the negative fuss about the ending. It's original, was hard to predict, and far from most Hollywood-sauce game endings, which is a very good thing. It's the gameplay that really matters, and for me, who appreciates more action than lengthly (and sometimes cheesy) dialogues, Mass Effect 3 just delivers. The combat parts are improved from ME2: better graphics, better (though not perfect) controls, and much more fun. Overall, it's a must-buy, fan of the series or not. The plus: - Really good and unpredictable story - Addictive combat scenes: after beating the game, I just wanted to go back to my saved missions and do the action parts again an again. So good that after playing a few hours of Halo4 (yawn...), I came back to ME3. - Incredible character design at the beginning (well like other MEs) - The Banshees: OMG... - The sound (music is okay; sound effects are great) - Terrific voice acting, and ...Martin Sheen as the Illusive Man, again. - The unbelievable richness of the ME universe (All credible species, civilization, planets, etc. up to nauseating details in the Codex... wow.) The minus: - Earth final mission rarely looks as a huge battlefield. I would have liked flanking dozens of allied fighters against the same amount of Reapers in the action sequences. Instead, it's always you and your 2 teammates against hordes of the same monsters, over and over, and cut scenes in between with huge battlefields to make you think you are part of a planetary **** failed. - Some lazy rip-offs from science fiction movies: Dune, Aliens, Star Wars. But hey, that's forgiveable. - Controls that still get in the way sometimes: trying to punch an enemy sometimes lets you 'slip' in front of him (use a kind of lock-on mechanism next time, please), just to get stabbed in the back after. - AI that is most of the time excellent, but sometimes strange: Cerberus soldiers are so strong, I don't see why they are not more aggressive (even in Insanity mode), and why they don't come more directly at you instead of retreating most of the time and hiding for long periods. If you are separated from them by a single obstacle, they will flee instead of jumping over to kick your ass. Sometimes, you are standing in front of a soldier, and... he does nothing, no shooting at all. Okay for easier modes, but unforgiveable for Insanity.",9,2013-02-02,XBOX 360,user
Fatbastad,"This game was FANTASTIC all the way to completing the Cerberus base mission. Then, it crashed and burned. It seemed like they poured their talent and resources into this game and ran out of both before they finished it. Both my wife and I played all three games and we both had the same reaction to the end. What interns made this ending? The concept philosophy of the end was right on the mark for a Sci-Fi. But it was poorly poorly executed and the choices you made through out the series were rendered completely irrelevant. My wife and I in 20 minutes could brainstorm a better execution of the ending and still leave their philosophical concept intact. What's their excuse?",3,2013-01-31,XBOX 360,user
neilrieck,"I should probably mention that I am a huge science-fiction nut so when a game comes along blending ""outer space themes"", ""human life in the future"", and ""alien worlds and/or cultures"" then you can count me in. Now I have played ""a lot"" of top rated games in the past 12-months and I never felt ripped off by any of them which I usually get through (in story mode) in about 5-7 days (although recently, ""Call Of Duty: Black Ops 2"" seemed a little on the short side). So imagine my surprise when I stumbled onto ""Mass Effect 3"" with its stunning graphics (I play on a PS3 connected to a 61-inch JVC hi-def display) which I bought for half the price of BO2 but am still playing in story mode two weeks later. The only negative thing I will say about this game is that many of your smaller alien opponents are not as realistic looking as the primary characters.

Socratease,"First off, i would like to point out that the ending has been talked about to death. So instead of pointing out how it committed story telling suicide (which it did), i`m going to focus on the rest of the game. 1. The Intro. Seriously, WHY would shepard, the renegade badass (in my playthrough) just sit around WAITING for the reapers to arrive for those few months in between ME3 and arrival? That doesn`t seem very shepard like. And why should i give a sh-- about some random kid? Verdict: bad writing. 2. Cerberus. So, a rogue terrorist organization goes from having only a hundred and fifty members just a few months ago to being the empire of star wars with almost limitless troops....... Yeah, sure. tell me another one, casey. Verdict: bad writing 3. Kai-lang. I have never been so annoyed by an emo **** of a video game character as i was by Kai-lang. As razorfist, my favorite youtube reviewer put it: if for the past decade the illusive man had access to a gravity defying emo space ninja with a katana that slices through mother f---ing planets, and with magic plot device powers that allowed him to track the movement of every sentient being in the galaxy, then why in F--K would he resurrect commander shepard?! Verdict: bad writing 4. Harbinger. Did harbinger just say screw it and go on a fishing trip when it came time for the invasion? Why was he portrayed as the ultimate badass reaper in ME2 only to be given a rediculous cameo in ME3? Verdict: bad writing 5. The ''arrival'' of the reapers. Okay, stop me if you`ve heard this one: Why did the reapers cross the void? To get to our galaxy, you gleefully respond. But HOW did they get to our galaxy? That`s right: They couldn`t have. Remember ME1? Remember when we stopped saren from activating the citadel so that the reapers could pour through? Remember the arrival DLC, where we blew up an entire solar system to stop them? So answer me this: if all the posible relays the reapers could have used were destroyed: HOW. IN. FU-- did they get here? Answer: they didn`t. Verdict: laughably bad writing 6. So the quariens go to war whether you pushed them towards it or not in ME2. And the point of having the option to say: good luck in the war, or: The reapers are coming, i`m going to need every ship i can get was.......? Verdict: far too heavy an emphasis on the illusion of choice, and not enough emphasis on MEANINGFUL choice. 7. The god d--n kid. I know this has been voiced at least a million times, but i`m going to say it anyway: why should my character, who has seen hundreds of innocent men, women, and children being liquified into a human reaper give even a marginal sh-- about ONE KID? They might as well have had giant flashing letters on my screen that said: FEEL SAD NOW. Verdict: atrocious writing And my verdict for the entire game is: Terrible. The most badly written game in the series with the most badly written ending in the history of video game trilogys. Don`t buy it. Not even if it`s in the bargain bin. EA doesn`t deserve your money or your time.",1,2013-01-22,XBOX 360,user
FierroSuave,"I let my Mass Effect 3 experience sit and gestate for nearly a year before I felt I could properly describe the sensations that it evoked.

kigl,"As a fan of the series, this game deviated from its original roots as a predominant RPG with shooter elements to now a predominately a shooter with a skin of a RPG elements. Even neglecting the rampant on disk DLC and plot hole ridden ending, the game is blatantly average. As a shooter it is adequate offering the staple cover shooter. However, the cover mechanics are often clunky in comparison to other games in the same genre. The game has roughly the same RPG elements as Mass Effect 2, while limiting, adds at least some flavor to the shooter Bioware/EA have turned the series into. The gameplay is not where Mass Effect 3 does poorly. It is the practices regarding story-necessary DLC and essentially the last 20 minutes of the game's story. The game wraps up many of the persisting conflicts of the series, only to introduce rampant deus ex machina and plot holes in the games final minutes. The altered Extended Cut DLC fails to address many of these plot holes as well. Bioware games are usually renown for their story and setting, but this game essentially throws this all to the wayside and leaves a bad taste in the mouth of many fans of the franchise. In all, the end result is an average cover-shooter and a series whose universe is tarnished in the name of ""artistic integrity"".",5,2013-01-17,XBOX 360,user

JoeLouis3849,"This game is everything Mass Effect wasn't. No exploration, now you slowly scan a planet and hope the game will allow you to land on the thing. Combat difficulty is no longer determined by player skill, but enemies who have infinite ammo, immunity to player attacks and can kill the player in 3 hits regardless of level. The storyline seems contrived... The whole game seems to be about collecting resources and trying to bed down one of your teammates. Virgins will get a kick out of that. FPS fans will enjoy the fact that there are little to no RPG elements that require them to use more than .006% of their brains to play this game. RPG fans will dislike this game's lackluster character development system. Me? I hate this game. That's right, I used the exact same review from Mass Effect 2. Why? Because if Bioware can't be bothered to improve the game in any way, then I can't be dithered to waste time pretending that I care enough about this abortion to write an all new review.",0,2013-01-02,XBOX 360,user

BelgianTofu,"Mass Effect is to games as ""The Godfather"" is to movies, it will be one of the few to be remembered by future generations. I could ramble on about the great graphics, intuitive game-play, and fun multi-player, but I will not, as that would distract you from the greatest draw of the game. It is a literary masterpiece, an epic of our times. Full of rich characters, grave loss, and hope. (Think Braveheart) . Many people dislike the ending to the story, much as many despise the classics of literature. I think the main cause of this is that the ending fills you with grief, something very few games can do. The fact that it causes you a negative emotion in the first place shows that there is literary power here. This is not game of the year people, this is the ending to the series of the decade. It's been a hell of a ride.",10,2012-12-29,XBOX 360,user

ME2, to me, is better than ME3, but ME3 is worth at least one complete playthru, and if you liked ME or ME2, you'll have fun playing ME3, even if you will be left flat or confused with the end.

But, I do get that it was the point and due to the narrative. The story is just beyond grandness and it just builds and builds until ...... you get a really anti-climatic ending?!

This game is the conclusion of your own commander shepard the way you chose to take him/her through this amazing well crafted story is met with praise and respect from your companions or the death and extinction of entire alien species.

Oxcart,"Very few times in gaming history has a title received so much controversy, so much vitriol, and been the subject of the undiluted ire of so many gamers. The source of the fury? The ending to a five-year, three-game story arc that had, by that point, drawn in so many gamers that it had transformed from game series into **** had literally undergone the Halo Effect, where an under-the-radar game ends up being such a huge franchise and dynamo of its own that it begins eclipsing itself. But the difference lies in the games: where Halo is a shooter with a lot of story laid into it, Mass Effect is fundamentally a story with a game built through it. Halo would have to try hard to screw up; as long as it provides the action and the intensity, it wins. Mass Effect never had it so easy. But that doesn't forgive what happened with the finale. Mass Effect 3 is, and may well end up being the textbook example of, a game that was set up to be great, only to be destroyed by the marketing department. The original ME laid the groundwork of a story where the player's actions MADE the story, DECIDED the plot, and were the end-all and be-all of the game. There were so many directions for the plot to go, all decided by the player. ME3 was the original ME's evil twin: a game that started off with hundreds of possible threads, only to ultimately file down to a single possible outcome, a game where all of the player's decisions, past and present, were rendered irrelevant. A great game was sacrificed on the altar of Marketing, as they tried to turn Mass Effect into something it wasn't: a mass-appeal shooter. The mutation began in the second installment, as shooter elements began overtaking role-playing elements. We gamers took this in stride, accepting the changes as some streamlining and minor changes (and, truthfully, some of the elements removed or changed were never our favorites). But something else happened: the storytelling began to be streamlined and dumbed-down as well. ME3 just finished ME2's trajectory -- straight into the dirt. In the quest for money (by trying to appeal to the largest audience), they converted Mass Effect into a nearly-brainless shooter, one which was loosely tied together with story in the game, and required story-seekers to look outside the game for real content -- they turned it into Halo: a game with a massive backstory that is only visible in the game if you know to look for it. Of course, all of this was prior to the Extended Cut DLC -- the amazing concession the gaming industry made to the Voice of the Gamers...which, really, was just placating enough to keep the masses of gamers from taking their beloved money elsewhere. EA knew it was in danger of alienating millions of money dispensers, and sought to make enough amends to avoid losing that cash. Overall, however, after all the changes the game has undergone, while it's still not particularly worthy of the Mass Effect mantle, ME3 is no longer the total pariah it had been. Decisions are back to having some value, and the previously-mandatory mobile game's value has been decreased, bringing fate back into the hands of the game...mostly. I held off on writing a review of this game when the Extended Cut was announced, otherwise it would've been another ""boycott EA"" pitchforks-and-torches rant. Now, while I'm still not pleased with the game's conclusion, it's not horrible, either, and at least does enough of a job to warrant a mediocre rating. Taken on its own, perhaps it would be considered a better game. But that's not possible. ME3 is part of a series, and a heavily connected series at that. If one of the Halo games had been a dud, it wouldn't significantly impact the others or the series as a whole; they just fix it next time, and judging it against its peers is unnecessary. But ME3 has to be held against the standards set by its **** it doesn't. Compared to the games that came before, ME3 just doesn't have what it takes to stand alongside. No matter what changes they made to the ending, it will always be a step behind. Thanks, Marketing department. Next time, stay out of the development process.",4,2012-11-18,XBOX 360,user

Fabtech23,"FULL DISCLOSURE: I am writing this review post ""ending patch."" Mass Effect 3 (and more importantly the entire series) is a triumph in video game story telling. This series has shown that interactive media can stand up to Hollywood and bring an emotional and compelling story into our living rooms and allow us to control the decisions made. The first Mass Effect revolutionized player choice. Mass Effect 2 expanded on this allowing you to completely ignore characters and their side quests, thus changing the outcome of the game, which would in turn change how Mass Effect 3 played out. Now on to Mass Effect 3. The controls are tight, the weapons have weight to them, and the story is emotionally gripping. Never once through the entire campaign did I think ""meh, well come out on top and win this."" BioWare wanted to project that sense of helplessness, and they did it well. Now, i stopped playing the game after hearing about the ending fiasco. I didnt want to see it. I didnt want the game series I loved so dearly to be ruined. I waited, and waited, and waited, and when that patch dropped, I fired my xbox up and finished the game. I was aware of how the ending played out, and with this patch applied, the ending gets a huge boost. Without it though I dont felt it would have ruined the game, not enough to justify a 0. The last 5% of the game **** does not justify giving the first 95% a bad score. Thats not how reviews work.

mailordermonstr,"BEST ENDING EVER!!!! OK, I'm just fooling around. But honestly, the ending isn't that horrible. You'll hear a lot of people complain about lack of options. This is somewhat true, but what do you expect? With the amount of choices made throughout the ME series, it would've taken individually customized endings for the thousands of different outcomes. But enough about all those whiny **** lets get to the review. If you've played the previous ME games, then you'll know pretty much what to expect when it comes to game play, graphics and sound. They're all top-notch. You'll likely run into all the characters you met in previous ME games, though your team will be made mostly of new people. The area where this installment detours is the story. Your goal in ME3 is to rally the troops for galactic war. Doesn't make for much of a story in its self, but rather offers various smaller stories as well as some closure to past stories. Will it leave you with some unanswered questions? Probably. The ME universe is simply too large for everything to be easily explained. And remember, this may be the end of Shepard's story line, but it's not the end of the ME universe. Also gone from ME is the tedious planet scanning found in ME2. Another addition of ME3 is the multiplayer. It's basically a horde mode. I had lots of fun with this and fortunately Bioware has shown a great deal of support with free DLC maps and characters. If you enjoy the combat in ME you'll enjoy this mode. If you enjoyed previous ME games, you'll enjoy this one. If you haven't played the previous games, than why are you reading this?

So I've quit. I don't know what else to say about it that hasn't already been said. I DO HOPE that EA/Bioware etc. take the time to carefully look into the feedback they've gotten from the fans regarding this franchise and take it to heart... somehow that seems a bit futile too.",2,2012-10-15,XBOX 360,user
guest1321,"From the start I felt a sensation of profound responsibility placed on my shoulders. At times the stories urgency seemed to drift away but it never hurt slowed the story progression or deteriorate the plot. I went into it considering how annoyed I was with Mass Effect 2 and the feeling that the game was one big checklist. I never really had that feeling in Mass Effect 3 and the missions seemed to link together (main quests) and tie in (side quests) really well and that was something I truly appreciated. The emotion that Mass Effect 3 inspired in me was unlike any game I've played before. I felt pulled in to consider the feelings of the characters and try to understand what they where going through. The decisions felt meaningful and weighted with no clear option that would seem fitting of the stereotypical Sheppard. As for the mechanics of the game I was extremely impressed. Combat felt good and I hardly ever ran out of ammo which I was frustrated with at first, for having removed the authenticity of the situation, but later came to appreciate as it allowed me to focus on the game. Being able to customize weapons to the extent and ease at which Mass Effect 3 allowed was highly enjoyable. I loved being able to go from a shop which sells upgrades to buying new guns to then choosing my gun set up and finally to customizing my armor all within an area aboard the normandy. I only caught glimpses of the environment in between the action but from what I saw I was extremely impressed. Every planet I visited felt distinct aesthetically as well as layout. Sure the game had a set path for you but when the path looked as good as it did I had no issues with it. Graphically the game was a step up from its predecessor but by no means a highlight of this generation. The audio however was truly an immersive experience. The ability of the music and soundstage to go from a casual point A to point B moment and then scale up to an epic fast paced section and pull me right in was brilliant. The audio was definitely something that will bring me back to this game just for the sheer feeling of grandeur and tragedy that it invoked in me. Now that I have beat the campaign once I have been playing a lot of the multiplayer and while I was initially concerned it was going to be another online shooter it really has taken on its own form and done it in a way that suits Mass Effect very well. The fact that it ties back into the single player is also a nice feature that while probably won't have a huge effect on my play style and where I devote my time I like the fact that the two are not totally disjoint. After finishing this game I could not help but want more, something that I have not felt from a game in a while, and something that helps this game earn a perfect score in my book.",10,2012-10-11,XBOX 360,user

bigbiscits,"The true over reaction of thousands of gamers has marred this amazing genre. No this game does not live up to its predecessors in anyway. The story OPTIONS feel more streamlined than before, the game play was the same as Mass Effect 2's, and of course the polarizing ending that crushed so many individuals. The story line content felt more rushed and ""to the point"". Each mission was just pick A or B until the end. (pick A, B, or C). This was a turn off and the side missions were very boring, most of the time I would pick them up and not even know how I had since they were triggered by random conversations going on in the world as you walked by. This was a big step down from the previous titles and took away from the experience. And of course the **** insanely overly infamous, polarizing ending. I personally did not like the ending along with everyone else. It was not what I wanted for my character. I do understand that this ending is what the writer's had in mind and I respect that and wish that they had not altered it. I understand this was their masterpiece that we were getting to take part in and what they want is what ultimately will happen. I think the majority of us understood that and reluctantly accept it. What stung so much though is that we didn't know it until the end. We felt like this was OUR masterpiece. Our story, to end how WE see fit. Unfortunately it was not. The game is still great even with the less than stellar ending. PEOPLE DO NOT LET THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS SCARE YOU!!!! They are all mostly from people very (understandably) disappointed with the ending. If you have not given the Mass Effect series a try I can not recommend it to you enough. Please go get Mass Effect 1 and start from the very beginning. Go through this massive, incredible story and decide for yourself. Even if the ending is upsetting, I would not take back a single second of my experience with the series. It is by far the best story in the history of gaming, bad ending or not.",8,2012-10-09,XBOX 360,user

Diwvsen,"Mass Effect 3 is a great game with some truly emotional moments and an overall better combat-system than the previous ME games. Commander Shephard and many of the iconic characters are back to save the galaxy when the Reaper invasion finally arives during the very beginning of the game. The quest to save all life from certain annihilation takes you to many different locations, including some you already know and some you've never seen. The graphics are great, offering great environmental variety and good character-animations. There are, however, some techical issues dragging the game slightly down. Don't expect the technical leap from ME2 to this game to be as dramatic as the one between the first two games was - ME3 in many ways looks and plays the same as the second installment in the franchise. The combat system works better than ever, and this time around it feels more like an RPG-shooter than the second game did, without being as clumsy as the first one. There is a lot of emphasis on weapon, armor and skill customization, which gives you a lot of ways to experiment with various playstyles until you find one thats suits you. Enemy AI has also been significantly improved. Not only are there now a lot more different enemies, they also behave very differently and will do everything from flanking you with shields, charging you and throwing grenades at you to expose you and take you down. The level design is also much better. Fighting areas are much bigger, which gives you more mobility and makes it easier to move from cover to cover. The classes work very differently and offer in themselves reason enough to replay the game. There are a lot of ways to experiment with your skill upgrades (as skills can evolve in many different ways), and this time around every class can use every weapon type at the cost of power-cooldown, which is a great addition. The Citadel is back and very atmospheric, but unfortunately it is quite boring to hang around, as sidequests are often fetch-quests that does not fit the conflict of the game. On to the story, which of course, is the most important part of this finale. The story and conflict is epic in scale and offers some truly emotional moments and powerful choices as you resolve some of the conflicts that have been brewing throughout all three games. A lot of the characters from previous games return, some as squadmates and others as sidecharacters helping you on your quest. There are also some new characters introduced, which I think is unneccesary, since there already are so many great characters available from the previous games. Don't expect as great a cast of characters, or as great character development, as that of ME2. Despite the scale of the conflict there a lot of fetch-quest in this game. Shepard often has to drop in to save an important person, or retrieve and object, in order to get help from someone, which can feel poor from time to time. You'll also grow sick of the mission debriefings with Hacket that follows every mission. These are shallow and serves as a way to mark the end of a mission, thus giving you the feel **** divided into levels, which does not suit the game. Choices from past games are well implemented in the way that characters respond to them, however, it is dissapointing that many past choices result in the same outcomes in this game. Mass Effect 3 also introduces multiplayer, which is very unneccesary. This is your typical Gears of War Horde mode clone, only it doesn't work as well and becomes boring after a while. It doesn\\\'t help that you have to play it in order to unlock the best endings possible. Mass Effect is best suited as a single-player experience, and should have remained one. The ending of the game is emotional and clever, but it doesn't give you that epic conclusion that you would expect after such a long journey. Don't expect moments as moving and pumping as Shephard's speech during the finale of ME2. The biggest dissapointment here is that none of your previous choices really affect that ending, and that you have to play multiplayer to get the perfect variable. The inclusion of day-one dlc also drags the game down, especially since the character and his tale included are much needed to understand the story and universe. Overall this game is an emotional experience that improves upon gameplay, but one that doesn't quite reach the heights of the previous games in terms of story and characters. Multiplayer shouldn't exist and the DLC should just have been a part of the game. The ending could have used more time and doesn't quite leave you with a satisfying conclusion as it should do after three games. Choices, both past and new, should have more impact as they did in previous games. Despite these isses, ME3 is an emotional and ambitious game that will likely hook you from beginning to end. If you are a hardcore ME fan, chances are you will be dissapoint",8,2012-10-04,XBOX 360,user

StripestheZebra,"Really, Mass Effect 3 just rocks. If you enjoyed the previous 2 even a little, be prepared to be amazed. It kind of melds the best elements of Mass Effect with the vibrancy and life of Mass Effect 2, which was easily the game of the year back in 2010.

Philip261,"To say Mass Effect 3 is a bad game is completely wrong, it gets some things that it shouldn't wrong but these cloud over the positives, I will lay this out so it is easier to read, I will leave the multiplayer out for the moment. POSITIVE - The combat is an improvement on Mass Effect 2, it is much more fluid and enjoyable. -The story (up until the final 20 minutes) is pretty good -The weapon choice is nearly as large as ME1 but all the guns are different and offer great variety -Set pieces are great NEGATIVE - The ending, although not as bad as some claim (now thanks to the extended cut free DLC it makes sense), it also leaves room for Bioware to implement the ""Indoctrination Theory"" (For more info go to Clever Noob Network on YouTube, they have 3 hour and a half documentries on this concept) -Some of the animations are poor, (Shepard often does a shoulder pat that looks like it's from the 90s - There are also marks that the game was rushed, e.g on mission one on Earth, when on the **** look down, the images of husks running below you looks terrible) -The combat, though very well polished is a little too easy, the ability to unleash ridiculously powerful explosions with biotics makes insanity really too easy in parts. -I found the fact that you can't go into true conversation with squadmates on the Normandy anytime a tad annoying but then again the banter that is thrown between them better them more than makes up for it STORY OVER MULTIPLAYER Without multiplayer I would have probably given this game a 6 or 7 It is the better part of the game and has very few flaws, for those who don't know the multiplayer is a horde mode (wave defence) with 11 rounds, however at 3,6 and 10 there is an objective to complete, this earns you credits to buy equipment. The 11th wave is an extraction wave where you have to survive for two mins and get to an extraction zone. You can play as a many different races and classes, there are lots of maps and you can fight Cerberus, geth or Reapers on either bronze (easy), Silver (normal) or Gold (hard), the number of credits increases the harder difficulty, they added a platinum difficulty in a free dlc where you fight all the factions at once who are at full strength at wave one. The multiplayer has been attacked by some critics but is actually incredible and adds huge replay value to the game For those interested I played Mass Effect 2 first, it was so well reviewed I felt compelled to play it. I then got Mass Effect 3 and earlier this year I got Mass Effect 1. So no I am not a ""true"" fan of the series but given i put 40 hours into ME3 within a week of owning it and am probably well past 200 hours of total play time on ME3 alone, I feel I am qualified to judge this game, unlike those who just played the game once and stopped playing due to the ending.",9,2012-09-19,XBOX 360,user

Necrotaur,"I score reviews based on how I feel about the game after finishing it, and it is very, very difficult to see past the terrible ending, multiple plot holes, and the utterly stupid ""big reveal"" of the Reaper's motives in Mass Effect 3. The ending, coupled with the Day 1 DLC (which is wrong no matter how you spin it) really leaves a bad taste in my mouth. The way it's presented makes no sense whatsoever and runs completely counter to the idea that your choices throughout the game matter. The ME series spans 5+ years of generally excellent media, and for it to end in a three way deus ex machina like it did is just mind blowing. It **** saying that, because the 90% of the game leading up to the end is really, really good, even if it played more like a 'best of' compilation than a completely new game. A quick note about the multiplayer: it's *kind of* good, but in other ways it's really, really bad. Gameplay wise it's a fun (if overpowered), Halo-esque shooter, but the community is beyond terrible, kicking players who are just starting out or have a low N7 score, and verbally berating those who either do too well or too poorly. Also, based on what happened to Mercenaries 2 when EA shut down it's servers, I have little hope for the future of ME3.",3,2012-09-09,XBOX 360,user
dosmax,"Despite what people have said about the ending, I thought it was an epic close to an epic series. This game marks that Shepard's story is at an end and that's exactly what the ending accomplishes. The unmarked side missions are my biggest complaint and I still didn't find them too annoying because if you just walked around you would easily acquire them and complete them. The game play was the smoothest of the series and the graphics were great. There were moments that made you want to jump up in anger and in joy as well as moments that drew a tear. It was a beautiful story, and I think it was an amazing ending for one of the best series ever produced.",10,2012-09-04,XBOX 360,user
M3ta,"The gameplay (i.e. combat) is good. The graphics are amazing. The presentation and story is bad. Sidequests involve either flying somewhere and shooting Cerberus people in a combat zone, or using the Galaxy map to scan planets. That's it - scan planets. You don't actually VISIT the planets, you just scan them, which allows to to magically recover artifacts, and rescue entire races. By pressing the scan button. These sidequests are picked up by eavesdropping on people's conversations in the Citadel (which, by the way, is the ONLY hub in the entire game... funny how everyone wants to meet you on the Citadel - there's nowhere else to go). ""Hey dude, heard you talking on the phone to your buddy, saying you needed an antidote to a Reaper poison... I just happened to travel to a planet, and bring you back the antidote... here ya go."" ""Orly? Thats... awfully convenient... thanks?"" You do get to meet your allies from Mass Effect 2, but it's more like ""Oh hey Grunt/ Samara/ Jacob, how're things? What's that, you'd like me to kill some stuff for you? Sure. OK, we've killed all the stuff... guess I'll catch you later."" It is nice to see how small decisions from ME1/2 played out, but you only really get to see it in small ways, like extranet messages. And finally, the ending seems to have been written by someone with no grasp of concepts like ""logic"", and is probably the most unsatisfying experience I've ever had with a franchise I used to love. Oh, and the DLC? With ME2, DLC like Shadow Broker was great since it added to the game and expanded on the universe and the characters - this Leviathan DLC is basically pointless for people who have finished the game. In short, the game looks great, but really disappoints - the polar oppoosite to the game that started it off, the first Mass Effect.",6,2012-08-31,XBOX 360,user

StapledYeti,"Mass effect has always been a series that has been a benchmark for sic-fi role playing games since it was released and with the latest instalment i can't see that changing any time soon. People slate it because they didn't get the ending they wanted or that Bioware changed the game in a way that reaches out to a richer audience, those aren't reasons to give a game a low mark in my opinion. I believe Bioware did everything perfectly except for a few minor problems. The first of which is that the game world restricts you a lot, you can't really venture anywhere whilst on a mission, this problem has been in the franchise all along and all i wished for was for that to change for this instalment. Its more of a insignificant annoyance than a problem to be honest. Another qualm i have is that the romance is still as stiff and awkward as ever, i found in mass effect that if i ran to the person i found most attractive after every mission to merely talk to them for two minutes they would eventually and consensual sex with me, this was both amusing and irritating to me and simply wasted my time. My final problem i see in the game is that the dialogue is a little bit... well... crap. In mass effect 1 and 2 the dialogue was both engrossing and interesting as what people said actually made a difference most of the time. This time round though you'll find yourself talking to people for no visible reason other than to yet again fill them game with time consuming conversation about matters that I'm sure the supposed saviour of the galaxy really shouldn't give damn about. I also need to mention the ending of the game which really does seem to be irritating people doesn't it! But seriously i see no problem with it, it wraps the game up nicely and gives the player a real emotional reaction, if this wasn't the case for you then lets just agree to disagree to you. Now as for the good points, i could sit here all day and tell you how the game is vastly improved on its predecessor, first of the combat both melee and ranged is vastly improved, i really enjoyed trying out different weapons i either bought or unlocked throughout the game and the ways they could be used, it was a fulfilling way to spend my space money. This is the same for armour unlocks and etc. The only problem with the armour is that some times they looked far too similar and that you could only buy full suits of a certain type if lets say you only wanted the helmet. Other than that making yourself look badass was pretty fun and indulging. Another point is also that the story is both brilliant and emotional, at some points it really hits home whats actually happening and at others it keeps you engrossed to the point where you'll not want t stop playing as you want to find out what happens next. My final point is going to be that the characters are just as interesting and boring as ever, some like garrus will keep you laughing and others will make you wish the conversation would hurry up but the most important thing is that Bioware have done a brilliant job in rounding off the relationships you have built with your crew members and how you come to terms with them before you set out on your final mission. Overall then this game is brilliant with just a few problems which i have outlined, these shouldn't keep you from playing it and enjoying the ride just as much as i did.",9,2012-08-27,XBOX 360,user

TheShakyMatty,"Mass Effect 3 is a journey that tugs at heart strings, makes you ask big questions and ends multiple story archs. The Mass Effect trilogy has been phenomenal, and has excelled in scope and story telling although the illusion of choice is ever present. While I invested my time in Mass Effect 3 it soon became clear that the game was telling an end of the story from the very beginning. This is how I suggest you treat the **** multiplayer is a fun edition and greatly expands the life of the product it was not somthing I asked for but fun regardless. It is not without fault so i cannot in good conscience give it a amazing score cause it is not. These faults are very minor and do not subtract from the game very much i.e. Trouble finding quest related people on map, lackluster epilogue, your choices do not feel as important as it could be and multiplayer connection problems.

ulysees33,"A fantastic game. It increases the stakes on every level and raises the bar for gaming. Taken as a trilogy it's a major achievement and unlikely to be superseded any time soon. When you factor in the different choices and outcomes, and the male / female, hetero / ****, renegade / paragon options, it's obvious that the games places an outstanding amount of flexibility in the player's hands to craft their own experience while still managing to tell a coherent and meaningful narrative that is genuinely moving. There may be specific features of the action, role play, art direction or story that aren't to everyone's taste - it's impossible to please everyone all the time - but to give this game anything less than a very positive review is simply nuts. As for the ending (s), I found it deeply satisfying. Rarely has a game franchise had such an impact on me - Final Fantasy or Metal Gear Solid are the only equivalents that come readily to mind. Plus a very good multiplayer, add on content and mobile content as well...! To make an original universe that is so ambitious and achieve so much seems genuinely unprecedented and puts gaming at the forefront of creative media. The only equivalent in movies at the moment would be the Nolan Batman films but I would say that even they pale in comparison. Bring on the DLC.",10,2012-08-14,XBOX 360,user

For a game focused on decision making, there isn't that many decisions in most cases you are only granted 2 options that are obviously Renegade or Paragon choices and nothing neutral. Very rarely do you even get a 3rd option in dialogue. There are also less RPG elements than before making this game more of a 3rd person shooter than an RPG. The new squad members were not nearly as interesting as the previous ones.

Snipestrifer,"Okay, NOW I realize why people would be disappointed, though I disagree with those saying the game is god awful. Yes, EA monetized the crap out of this game, but that's no where the game fails, that's just bad business practice of the publisher funding the game's development. First, the positives. The combat has been refined and is pretty much as good as it can get at this point, although the new weight system hits infiltrators and non-power based classes REALLY hard. So I have to pick between having all my guns and almost never being able to use Adrenaline Rush now? That's stupid! (Wow, this got negative fast). That negative aside, the AI has been improved and enemy variety and behaviour has improved significantly, it's just slightly irritating most of the time it's cerberus and not the Reapers you're fighting (How did Cerberus build an army of millions in barely half a year, when they're known as a terrorist organisation?). Weapon modding is back and now it also has a visual effect as well as a gameplay effect, which is cool. It's not as deep as ME1's weapon modding system, but it spares us of that horrible inventory system and combined with ammo powers it integrates very well into the gameplay. Also, we get more gun variety and armour variety, which is always a good thing. So essentially combat is much better than before, so why is this game only a 7? It's Mass Effect! It should like a 9 or a 10, right? Well, unfortunately here are many negatives that hold this game back. The intro is boring and sloppy, especially compared to ME2. The reason is one, no dramatic opening and two, a crap ton of auto-dialogue (I'll be getting to that in a minute, believe me). As I'm re-familiarizing myself with the game mechanics I can't get invested into the story because in order to get invested into the story I must have reasonable knowledge of the game mechanics. Placing a major plot point at the time of a tutorial is probably the worst thing you can do with the intro. ME2 did this right, where I only had to run and move the camera in a controlled environment, so I could get invested in the story. The more advanced mechanics were saved for later when nothing as important was happening. The next negative is auto-dialogue, and it's over abundance. WHY? WHY WOULD YOU PUT IN LOADS OF AUTO-DIALOGUE IN A GAME BASED AROUND DIALOGUE CHOICES? That makes NO sense and just robs the player of the feeling that their Shepard is really theirs, and destroys immersion and the freedom the player previously experienced. The next negative is the abandonning of the build-up of ME1 and ME2, specifically Harbinger and the Dark matter plot. For those that don't know, ME3 was supposed to have a plot that revolved around dark matter but was abandoned for the whole ""Synthetic vs Organic"" thing. This leaves returning players confused as to what's going on and de-means the previous games. Not good. As for Harbinger, he was clearly set-up as the main villain in ME2, why reduce him to a glorified heavy hitter at the end? WHY? Everyone was looking forward to confronting the Harbinger why rob us of that? More abandonning of the build-up of the previous games. So second from last we have the problem that the story itself is more linear and interrupts and dialogue choices don't affect a conversation like they used to. They are generally just there for flavour and that's it now, which a shame considering how genius interrupts were as a concept and how well ME2 did them. And now to everyones favourite part, the ending. Where to begin... Well, even with the EC (Extended cut) it makes ZERO sense, and completely contradicts the themes of the Mass Effect franchise. It's disgusting. Your choices don't matter (As if EMS made your choices matter anyway LOL) apart from this one final choice and they don't even commit to Shepard dying. The EC provides the bare minimum character closure required and closes a few plotholes but it ends up trading them for more plotholes so it really is not much better and the character closure has been done before and BETTER with Dragon Age: Origins. Now THAT was an ending. This game is still very solid and enjoyable even if it is has some serious flaws. It still has those ""Magic Mass Effect"" moments, and the characters are as cool and well-written as ever (Apart from Vega) with their arcs coming full circle now, but compared to the other two ME games it doesn't even come close to reaching their levels of greatness. There are other complaints, such as the shafting of the ME2 cast, and a lot of fridge logic moments, and the fetch quests, but I could keep going for hours. All you need to know is this game is solid, but if you were expecting an amazing finale, prepare to be disappointed.",7,2012-08-09,XBOX 360,user

BlackPhoton,"Save your money and don't make the same mistake I did buying this game. If your a fan you will rip your hair out after playing this game, but if you are a newcomer play ME1, ME2 and imagine that this game never existed. If you have bought the game DO NOT BUY From Ashes DLC. It isn't worth the price and if you play this game on PC you can unlock the character from the ''From Ashes'' DLC with notepad. Reasons you will hate this game: 1 - It turns away from Sci-Fi and goes to space magic. 2 - All the decisions you made in previous games won't matter. 3 - Too much auto dialogue from start to finish. 4 - Boring side missions, those side mission are all the same and pointless. 5 - No more than six or seven crew members. 6 - Reapers look and function differently than in previous games. 7 - Major plot-holes. 8 - No original missions. 9 - Multiplayer that is worth playing long as it gets dlc's every month. 10 - Duologue options are useless, people will often answer the same way to your all duologue options, same with Shepard. 12 - The ending is very unoriginal, contradicts the franchise and contains a lot of space magic.

LostRiot,"As seen in many reviews, I am a huge fan of the series, but this one I had some personal feelings about. I really love the story and all the character structure. I enjoy the new features and the fact that they brought back some of the customizing features from the first game. Now the fact that I really don't play RPG games often because they are a challenge if they attempt to be like shooters, but Mass Effect was amazing in story and character customizing that I saw past the not so smooth play of the shooter mechanics. The second Mass Effect streamed lined them enough but did sacrifice RPG play. The third I felt focused to much on making this play like Gears of War and lost the fun challenge of an ""RPG shooter"" that made it different and original. Now for the story. Drop the Indoctrination Theory Issues, why did you do everything you did in he game not to see some resolution to each of the allied factions you earned through the entire game. I felt skimped. I don't blame Bioware so much as I blame EA. EA has to be the worst at putting a deadline on games and ruining the creativity that the developers need to make quality. EA and Activision will ruin the gaming industry if the keep up with there heavy marketing, poor deadline dates.

EnigmaReviews,"Well one of the best gaming series ever has come to an end. When I first got my hands on the game I immediatly notices differences from the second game. The first of course is the graphics. Although they don't compare to the those of Uncharted, Gears of War, and Crysis they are still good in their own way. The next thing I noticed is new animations. This is good because in a lot of sequels devs will recycle the same animation. I got to the story and it was extremely good no suprise there. The gameplay was great, weapons where awesome, and the characters where likeable. The multiplayer isn't that great to be honest. It seem like something they tacked on to add more to the game. Although the free DLC is a bonus it isn't much of a plus. Now here comes the ending drama. (Please note that I am writng this review after the extended cut dlc). This part of the game has gathered a lot of negative feedback. The ending by far was good. The main thing I have a problem with is what Bioware promised. The ending didn't have much variety in them. Also your decisions really don't have zero effect on the ending as well which is a huge let down. Overall this is an amazing game but if you where a fan from the begining them you will feel disapointed at the end. That doesn't take away from the game though. It does so much good that it heavily out weighs the bad. Mass Effect 3 is a 9/10 if they would have got the ending right it would have been a master piece.",9,2012-07-24,XBOX 360,user
NateStC,"While the story, voice acting, and cinematics may be great, it still doesn't make up for the fact that as a game it is horrible. In ME2 they went for a more tactical combat approach and it worked. This time they tried to throw in some Gears of War style faced paced action into the combat and it completely screwed everything up. Every battle field is littered with cover that your character gets on the wrong side of half the time, and there is so much debris it makes it nearly impossible to navigate, even outside of combat. To make things even more difficult, the controls are clunky, making it even further difficult to move anywhere. Another thing that ruined the tactical combat is that in half of the combat scenarios, you have enemies flanking simultaneously from literally every direction, making it nearly impossible to stay alive even on the easier combat settings. Every single combat situation is nothing more than a clusterf***. There are tons of side missions, which I love! But alas, they screwed that up as well. There is so much dialogue it is impossible to keep track and even decipher all the tasks you're given. The mission journal offers little to no information on objectives, and don't ever update as you progress. This is an incredibly disappointing game. Were I to hold it up against the other games in this franchise, I'd have to give it a 1 out of 10. But to be fair I've graded it on it's own, not up to the hype or expected greatness Bioware commands. Ultimately the game feels unfinished. They focused so much on the dialogue and story it feels like they only got half way through testing the actual gameplay then shipped it to market. I can't imagine it is even fixable through patch. Shame on you EA and Bioware for such a pathetic display.",3,2012-07-24,XBOX 360,user
Hugh5031,"Mass Effect 3 is a great game, that I believe is wrongfully hated on. The reason for this is simple, it changed genres. While the first game was a fully-fledged RPG, the combat mechanics in the first game were sloppy, and in the next game gameplay was vastly improved, but RPG elements were toned down. This left hardcore RPG fans unhappy, This third game definitely has the best gameplay in the series, for the overpowered particle rifle to the addictive Scorpion, but less RPG elements than ever before. Don't let this fool you though, the story is as good as ever, with some truly awesome moments and payoffs, a surprisingly good multiplayer, and plenty of visits from old characters. I would highly recommend playing the series the whole way through, but don't expect the RPG experience in each game, but come in expecting in this third game an awesome action game with RPG elements. Also, the ending wasn't one i particularly liked, but didn't detract as much from the game as the vocal minority say, especially with the extended cut endings. Free DLC in this game is awesome, considering it is an EA game. Overall, I'd rate this game a clean 9.5 and definitely recommend the series to anyone looking for an awesome story that they'll remember for years to come.",0,2012-07-23,XBOX 360,user

One thing that really annoyed me was if you imported your character from ma1 and ma2 you started at level 30 with the majority of your abilities not far from being maxed out. Not much of a challenge in that. Overall i feel that with the revised ending mass effect 3 was a fantastic game. Good ending to the trilogy.

The build up of the story takes off quite quickly and its easy to get into the gameplay and the story.

Gameplay and combat wise, Mass Effect 3 absolutely excels. I had a blast playing through all of the missions and it scores a 9.5 here. As for the plot (before the end), It was solid but they could have worked a lot more of the intricacies developed early in the series into this final story, it scores an 8.5 here. The end... oh the disappointing end. Even after the director's cut extended ending, I found myself saying ""why Bioware?"" Essentially, they added a insipid slideshow recapping what you just accomplished, that's all. This ending to my favorite sci-fi trilogy nearly **** my love of the games. This ending scores a 2.

Mass Effect 3 delivers an emotional ****. With cameos from the original games and an epic story, Mass Effect 3 seems like the ending to a TV show you really love.

maltizar,"Okay... if you hadn't noticed, playing this game, you'll either love it and be annoyed by the people that hate it or love it and hate the game and be annoyed by the people who love it. One of the major requirements is the experience of the previous two games which means it's not all that great of a stand alone game. The ending is not for everybody, so even if you did play the previous games, there's no guarantee you'll like it. The story is disjointed. There are game aspects that those who played the previous games won't understand because they didn't read the books or they didn't read the comics and even that's not going to mean you're going to like it. Gameplay is the greatest improvement. There are better games with better controls, but it's obviously the biggest improvement. That said, it lacks gaming systems like minigames, quality side missions and boss battles. It's like it's a game designed by people who wished they were writing a novel instead of making a game. It's a space RPG with no exploration. It's a bland shooter that doesn't revolutionize anything whose targeting systemyou either like or don't.. It's a ""choose your own adventure"" with limited choices. It's a space sci fi space opera that fails to live up to the greats. I was going to give it a 5, then I remembered that you have to download a different ending because the first one was really bad instead of disjointed and contrived. You also have to pay for a downloadable 7th character. To unlock the all the endings, you have to either download the Extended cut or play multiplayer to unlock the endings just on the disc. Some of the plots, you have to play the previous games. They're better, so going back to play another game to play this one seem pointless considering it doesn't matter in terms of resolution. If you do play those games, you end up playing better quality games not restricted by a badly timeline. Storywise, the resolution is seperate from the rest of the series, which is a shame because the rest of it was pretty darn good. I'd say, save your money. If you haven't played it by now, you'd have a better time playing one of the first 2 games. It'll be in the used game pile soon, anyway.",1,2012-07-03,XBOX 360,user
DetectiveEyes,"Mass Effect 3 starts some time after the 2nd one ended. You are given the choice to go with the Role-play perspective of the game, with little combat throughout the game, or you can choose to go with the action perspective of the game with little Role-play and dialog, and more of the shooting and blowing stuff up. At the beginning it took me a moment to actually grasp what was happening but eventually it became pretty clear. Almost instantly you are given a gun and told to kill all the aliens in your path. Pretty soon after, you are given the choice to be nice and understanding of your friend or to be a complete jerk to him and tell to **** it up and fight. Then there's the whole decision making standpoint of the game, where you choose to do the right thing, or to do the wrong thing. Now for the problems, there's an equal amount of pros as there are cons in this game. The good parts of the game would definitely be its engaging storyline. However its bad counterpart is the 3 endings you are faced with. I wont get very deep into spoiler and whatnot, but the endings are all bad, and look like they were halfway done in order to make the Mass Effect 3 release date. The ending completely has nothing to do with everything you have done in the story whatsoever. However there is still hope. The game still had its relationship aspect where people could be your friends, your enemies, or your lover. Without the game you can alter the relationship at almost anytime, as you can talk to almost anybody, at any time. The game still has its aspect of freedom, to a certain point at least. Another problem with the game is the dialog system. When you are talking to somebody your facial, and body movements are not the most realistic. As with the person you are talking to. But I think most people would have to understand that the game would have come out sometime is early May or late April if the facial expressions were better than they are now. And it could have released sometime in June if they made the endings better. Overall this game is, in my opinion, worth the 60 dollars to pay for it, and also has some very nice sex scenes in it.",7,2012-07-02,XBOX 360,user
Tubey,"Here's the problem - Mass Effect is a magnificent series; but I can't recommend ME3 as a 10/10 game, or even anywhere close. The problem with it for me isn't really the ending (yes, it's true, it was unbelievably bad), but rather the fact it should be renamed ""Gears of Modern Battlefield 5"". I honestly don't class ME3 as an RPG; rather, it's an on the rails mediocre shooter, interspersed with a lot of cut scenes and dialogue, which is again on the rails. Even if you are a big fan, go back and think about it - you are treated to a lot of dialogue, you make choices etc. but no matter what you choose you move forward to the very same portion of the game as everyone else - you shoot stuff and run through corridors. I didn't feel like I was ""role playing"" as Shephard, unless you consider Call of Duty an RPG as well! Unlike ME 1 & 2, I felt very little for the plight of Shephard because throughout the game the overall writing is a bit sub-par compared to previous games. This is, in my opinion, symptomatic of the problems at Bioware at the moment; style over substance. It was like after two superb games I was being abandoned as a fan in favour of commercial appeal above and beyond anything else. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a ""bad"" game; you'd have to be completely out of your mind to say that ME3 is anything other than decent as a total package. But - and it's a big but - it's nowhere near the perfect game and in relation to the franchise it takes a giant turd on what has gone before. So it's bizarre to sum it up in this way, but there's no other way to put it - if you're a Call of Duty fan, looking for a more ""in depth"" game without sacrificing the mindless shoot 'em up FPS experience, then Mass Effect 3 is for you. However, if you're a fan of Mass Effect 1 & 2, then this game may very well disappoint you. At the very least, if you play this game, switch it off as soon as you see a glowing holographic image of a child - you'll thank me for doing so. So yes, I'd be wrong to score it any less than 7/10, but what I will say is that after the debacle that was Dragon Age 2 and now the less than stellar Mass Effect trilogy conclusion, I will be careful to spend money on a product bearing the Bioware logo, simply because the once accepted measure of excellence they held in a gamers heart has been lost. Let's hope a return to form is just around the corner.",7,2012-07-02,XBOX 360,user
JamesBondHero,"First, to get it clear, all the reviews that gave ME3 a 0 or 1 are just... can't use profanity... there's no way a game could get a score like that. The only problem that made Mass Effect 3 get bad reviews from just ""fans"" is because of the endings. Now the Extended Cut, a free DLC, fixes probably more than half of the issues, including the bad ones, making the ending a satisfying and sad end to the best video game trilogy ever created. The game has minor flaws: glitches, and awkward moments but not game breaking. The game has everything: fun, epic moments, love, care, role playing, action, adventure, heart pumping moments. Not buying this game would be a HUGE mistake, except if you never played the previous Mass Effect games, which are masterpieces. Maybe I make Mass Effect sound overrated, but the best thing about it, is that ME3 is that good. A simple art masterpiece. But it isn't perfect of course, the game could have been improved with more content, as it lacks of appealing side quests. The side quests (optional assignments) are unnecessary and too the point of boredom, but as I said: optional so I won't add it to my score. It is worth your money and none should be disappointed now, as the end has been fixed. Do not even judge by the extremely negative user reviews.

HunterZolomon,"I'm changing my previous review in light of the new Extended Cut. I'm changing it to ZERO! Despite the Extended Cut this game still has the worst ending in the history of video games. They actually took the time to polish the turd instead of addressing the numerous and serious flaws in the game. Bioware has completely lost all credibility in the last few years. Not only because their new games are rushed and come nowhere near the level of excellence they used to, but because they treat their fanbase like **** and lie to them.",0,2012-06-28,XBOX 360,user
Tehsoupman12,"As much as I really wanted to enjoy Mass Effect 3, there really is the feeling of this game getting rushed out of the door. In comparison to the first two, the story is paper thin, revolving around priority missions which somehow or another result in a main character being killed, much to my extreme disdain. The combat, I feel, isn't as well done or even fun as its predecessors, and by the time the nonsensical ending came along, I was so ready to be done, that I didn't even care. Truly one of the most disappointing sequels I've ever experienced.",6,2012-06-27,XBOX 360,user

The writing is phenomenal, the voice work is amazing, and gameplay is fun and easy to use. The graphics are a little outdated, but that doesn't matter, because everything else shines.

Vehement,"Hate ME3 with a passion. I swallowed ME2 because the non-existing storyline was compensated by great characters (Mordin, Garrus, Thane, Samara, Illusive Man). All the major characters in ME2 are irrelevant to ME3, because all but one becomes brief, un-join-able NPCs and their deaths are inconsequential to the story. While Tali returns as playable, her role is moot in the storyline. What is worst is that all the new team members are bland. The Collector story from ME2 is pointless other than vaguely explaining indoctrination and introducing the Illusive Man, who goes from a major protagonist to antagonist in ME2 to a side character in ME3. He even went from a racist to a racist who turn himself to another race. Ironic? Bioware ripped out the great character developments in ME3 and left us with a bad story. ""Hey guys! I found something that looks like a blueprint to something. It might be a weapon but we don't know. This blueprint is from a race that was wiped out by the very entities threatening us, so we should gamble and put the entire galaxy's resource into building it!."" WORST PREMISE EVER! The details of the device should have been placed before the making than after the making of the device!!! What the hell was Shepard doing for the past 6months or a year between ME2 and ME3?

chris23433,"Mass Effect 3, the epic finale to one of best sci fi trilogies created. The finale though, completely ruins what was one of the best series ever. It's not just the ending. Although yes the ending destroys all semblance of immersion, canon, good story telling, and much more, it's not only the ending that makes Mass Effect 3 a terrible conclusion. First off, the gameplay or lack thereof. The conversations are nothing like they used to be in the previous two. Whereas in the previous two you could input Shepard's descisions on the tiniest of choices, in Mass Effect 3 it's almost gone. You make some dialougue choices throughout the game, but most of the choices are made for you (I was playing on rpg mode by the way.) The quests are mainly filler consisting boring fetch quests. Although the side missions that are playable and have you on the ground are quite alot of fun to play and are the best moments in the game. Oh, and my final gripe the multiplayer. The online although alot of fun, SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN NECESSARY TO OBTAIN THE BEST ENDING IN THE SINGLEPLAYER. I remember hearing one of the developers at Bioware talk about how the multiplayer could impact the finale, but wouldn't be necessary to obtain the best ending. What happened to that? What happened to the various amounts of endings? What happened to amazing choices? What happened to Mass Effect? I don't know to be honest, but it's quite sad to see what was one of the best series in gaming from one of the most talented developers in the industry, deliver a product this... dissapointing. I remember playing the first Kotor and the first Mass Effect games, and being amazed at the amount of choices I could make, and the impact I had on the characters. Hell, in the original Kotor towards the end you could completely turn on your old squadmates and reclaim your title as Lord of the Sith with the aide of one of your former crewmates/love interest. In the original Mass Effect if you played it right you could convince of one the main villians to kill himself in order to help the galaxy. This, though is not the Bioware of Kotor or ME1. In ME3 none of your choices throughout the entire series matter when it comes to the ending. None. All you get are three different **** color explosions with the same exact pros and cons regardles of what you choose. This game was horrid. Perhaps, the ending dlc Bioware is making shall remedy the ending. Even if it does though, the dissapointment I felt while playing through Mass Effect 3 and viewing its ending shall not. I have lost a great amount of faith in Bioware as a good developer. It's sad to see what could've the most epic conclusion in gaming go so poorly.",1,2012-06-14,XBOX 360,user
Sandrick,"The ratings separation over this game tells you where the critics allegiances lie... ALL POSITIVE REVIEWS???? Give me a break - even if the ending would have been fantastic, there were still a lot of issues with the game. My biggest issue is that Mass Effect is a game of choices that all lead up to different outcomes. Both of the first games had them and that was what fans came to expect. The fact that this one opted for the easy, tacked on ending just shows how rushed it was. So sad to see a stellar franchise end on such a tragic note, sacrificing creativity and quality in the face of corporate greed. It wasn't even just about the story of the ending. There is a scene where Shepard and Anderson are supposed to be looking out at a view of Earth and Anderson says ""what a view"" and it is literally the WORST low resolution bitmap image that I have ever seen in a game. In the ending sequence... How is that not rushed and a slap in the face to all of the people who gave them their money and trust. I truly feel sorry for the employees that worked on Mass Effect 3, knowing that it was such a bomb ****. They likely wanted to speak up, but like many people in this economy, didn't jeopardize their jobs. Well, they have to live with that now - It probably won't be the first thing that they mention when someone asks what they worked on... Then, looking at the user reviews, you see a very different picture. Split right down the middle, with an incredible amount of negative reviews. I wonder if EA employs a division to write positive reviews to offset this.",4,2012-06-14,XBOX 360,user
Cuddlezombie,"I know that this score my seem harsh to some of the hardcore Mass Effect gamers out there, but i was so disappointed with Mass Effect 3 that in my opinion it doesn't deserve a better rating. I have way to many complaints to list here, but the things that really annoy me about this game are simple. Bioware have gone from ripping of other sci-fi tv shows, games, books etc to ripping of Gears of War and badly at that. Also, why do they feel the need to do a Dragon Age 2 and overly sexualize the characters. For a female gamers such as myself, I dont need to see Miranda's bum when I am having a conversation and dont want to play a game that degrades women.

Vertillian,"Before anyone calls me a ""troll"" for giving this game a zero, allow me to explain. Originally I thought this game deserved a 5/10. I found about half the content enjoyable, if a little bland. The music was lacking in atmosphere, the dialogue is ropey and the graphics buggy! (my characters head revolved like an excorcist moment!) Then came the gameplay, removed almost completely from anything remotely RPG and lacking depth. The A.I are atrocious, constantly glitching through walls and running backwards into enemies. Despite this, I was enjoying an average 5/10 game. Then came the release day content that was included on the disc, pointless multiplayer, ridiculous flirting for no reason, massively boring sections of corridor shooting monotony, and the fact I had to swap disc four times within 40mins!!! This is yet another over-hyped and over-rated lazy effort from bioware. I waited and only paid Â£15 for it and still felt cheated. If this is the supposed ""natural evolution of the RPG"" I worry for the future of decent, in depth games. My last grievance, that really dropped the score, was the blatant copying of Gears Of War. The cover system I can accept, but now add roady-running, rolls, jumps and melee. Also now a hammer of dawn impression! Give it a rest Bioware and get your own ideas.",0,2012-06-12,XBOX 360,user
niketnb,"There have many reviews about this game, and most of them are commenting about the poor ending of this game. But I think this game is definite a worth to buy game, the reason because of the multi-player. How the graphics were superb with a very dandy covering system, going through every corners, sprinting and cover from enemies firing. There just had many ways to play your own style of game, with a lot of selection of characters and using different abilities. On the other hand, limited maps and difficulty were the main problem in multiplayer which lower the score. For professional gamers, I think gold challenge was a bit too easy due to the fact that there were too much ways to play this game, entertaining with communicating with four players. Moreover, multiplayer only have 5-6 maps weren't enough to last the gameplay long, which only for maximum 1 month or so. Increasing the varies or mods in multiplayer can improve the overall rating since that the single player's ending was weak. Overall, I think this game's selling was just for multiplayer, if gamers were just waiting for the single player, this game won't be your choice.",5,2012-06-11,XBOX 360,user
DETHREAPER,"The most brilliant game to be made yet. The story lived up to, and even set the bar higher for what a science fiction story could do. The perfect mix of philosophy, analytical thought, and emotion present created something no other story has been able to achieve, and that is perfection. To be fair, video games aren't just about story, no matter the level of brilliance, but gameplay also. That being said, Mass Effect 3 is a paradigm of an RPG shooter, which again, set the bar higher for others. On another note, I was a bit leery about the soundtrack when I heard that Jack Wall was leaving, but as soon as I heard what Clint Mansell had to present, my fears were assuaged; as usual, he has masterfully orchestrated pieces that contribute to mood and emotion, while sticking to the roots of the series' sound.

BeatrixKiddo27,"Mass Effect was my favorite game series ever. I was a huge fan on Bioware, owning almost all of their games. Mass Effect 2 is my favorite game of all time. I was so excited for the ending to the planned space opera trilogy, and for the most part, it was amazing. Throughout the entire game, I was in awe of the amazing scenes played out. This game was larger than anything before in the series, and you face some of the biggest intergalactic issues, such as the Geth & Quarian war. The gameplay is tighter, the character interaction great, 95% of this game is a masterpiece. Then you reach the infamous ending. This ending ruined everything, this game, and the trilogy as a whole. It is somewhat amazing that in 10 minutes, Bioware is able to destroy a series. When you think Mass Effect, you think player choice and impact. This ending takes that all away, and makes literally every choice you made prior pointless. Rather than give an ending that made sense, one that was hinted at by the games, they decided to try to transcend the game into an artistic statement. Instead they created plot holes, and divided their fanbase. Oh well, there's always Uncharted.",3,2012-06-10,XBOX 360,user
Blidly,"I wanted to like this game I swear. I loved the first two games and was prepared for more but I just couldnt love it like the others. The game plays very similary to Mass Effect 2 , though I have been spoilt by playing other amazing 3rd person shooters and this felt quite weightless and cover mechanic I didnt like. The enemies are quite generic and all follow similar patterns, meaning it felt repetitive. The game has been updated graphically to make it look fantastic , though with this high polygon count this means shepard always has to have his gun out like a sociopath. The story is awesome and I really enjoyed it, though ""cameo-ing"" all the characters from the previous game felt very cheesy , though was nice to see what happened to them. In the end the story was what pulled me through the boring action, if you've never played Mass Effect , play ME2 and then decide to continue. If you played the others, play through this just to finish your story.",7,2012-06-09,XBOX 360,user
FictionalOrange,"This game is thus far the best of the year- and perhaps could have been one of the best games of all time, save for lackluster ending. The journey to get to that ending, however, is what counts. People who say the ending ruined the whole series are idiots- the game is gorgeous from start to finish. The story is brilliant, the characters are well developed, and the gameplay is tight and satisfying. Player choice shapes the path to the conclusion, allowing each player to make their own story, although the ending itself is perhaps not as user-driven as many fans would like. Fans of the first two installments will not be disappointed with the game itself, although those seeking closure and every answer to every question posed in the mass effect universe should be wary that the conclusion provides neither. It is the ending of the game, which feels so disjointed from the rest of the game and unrelated to anything else in the entire series, that ultimately holds the game back from being one of the greatest of all time. That said, when taken as a whole, the game ties up many loose ends from the previous two installments and immerses new and old players alike in the series' rich lore. The graphics are gorgeous minus a few flaws here and there and the soundtrack is beautiful and haunting- the series' best. This game was beautifully executed (excluding the questionable ending) and dwarfs every other game I've played recently. It will stick with me for a while.

TheMaximalist,"The Mass Effect series for me has been one of the best for this generation and now Bioware is bringing us the final show down we have been waiting for since 2007. I must say this is one of my favorite games ever. The story is naturally awesome because the player makes it with the many more complex decisions and epic battles. The galaxy is in chaos and the only way to survive is to unite and to do this Shepard must bring the galaxy together. This idea allows Bioware to add those tough decisions and those epic battles so the game isn't so action centered like Mass Effect 2. Talking about the action all the shooting and power distribution mechanics have been smoothed and the game feels less static than ME2. The set pieces and the remarkable battles have made even more epic and weaves dialogue into it all. The graphics are great but not the best on 260 and the soundtrack was great and weapon sounds had a great bang bang to them. 360 users can also use Kniect to issue commands on the battlefield and speak in cutscenes. This was good most of the time but sometimes I did a really loud ""ohhh what do I do"" and it chose for me which ****. This game is suitably awesome with the whole shooter rpg mix done perfectly. Mass Effect 3 also includes co-op multiplayer which is a first for the series and I really enjoyed this. Most co-op multiplayer isn't really that compelling but this was great. It's a wave mode with bonus objectives which you gert credits for which you can spend on new characters,weapons and upgrades. There has been 2 free dlc packs with new characters and bonuses.

braddogg623,"The ending . . . ugh. If you're checking Metacritic, you know the flaws of the ending of Mass Effect 3. It's a crime. But, the journey to the ending is tremendous, and the people giving a low rating to ME3 tend to focus on the last 10 minutes rather than the first 30 hours of the game. ME3 hits the balance between action and RPG: ME1 was nuts-and-bolts RPG (modding your guns took hours in total if you wanted to make a difference in gun performance), ME2 was very action-oriented (simplistic leveling system, minimal weapon upgrading, though the side quests mechanics of crew loyalty hinted at RPG roots). In ME3, you have the opportunity to really create a character with the combat strengths and weaknesses you desire. The shooter mechanics in ME3 were also very good. Despite some trouble grasping the cover system early on, I was able to complete the game on Insanity (high-level adept class imported from ME1 & ME2) without much difficulty, but with a lot of patience. The game featured more cut-scenes than I was accustomed to seeing in a Mass Effect game, which was disappointing, but the cut-scenes were good graphically and fit the general expectation I had of my Shepard. In short, ME3 is a good blending of ME1's RPG focus and ME2's action focus. I hated the ending, but I still give this game a 9/10. Especially if you played ME1 and ME2, you'll love ME3 except for the last 15 minutes. Stay tuned for free DLC to fix that ending, too.",9,2012-05-31,XBOX 360,user

lllama408,"This game truly deserves a perfect score. Not based off track record with the entire series, but just looking at the single game itself, it's one of the games you hold onto forever just for the memories and replay ability. Just to get it out of the way, I understand everyone's frustrations with the ending scenes and how they felt there was no closure whatsoever, too bad. Questions don't always get answered, but that doesn't automatically cancel out everything the game had accomplished up to that point. It's like comparing it to a football player. His first 10 seasons of play are phenomenal and record breaking, but then he is human so he has a mediocre 11th year, and disregarding his entire career and saying he is a bust because he had one human effort of a year. The visuals are stunning all around, sound is great, gameplay is intense and innovative at times, and the story is beyond captivating especially if you have stuck around for the entire series. The multiplayer is beyond fun and time consuming, and satisfying when you unlock a new character before your friends do. The one knock I have on it is that you pretty much do have to play at the 2nd installment of the game before the 3rd to truly understand everything that is going on and not have TOO many questions starting off the game. Faltering it from just being a game a noob to the series can pick up and just start at. Lay off the bad ending, deal with it, move on to a new series, or hope it was BioWare's plan all along with the new DLC coming soon, or meaning the series isn't over.",10,2012-05-24,XBOX 360,user

GooBear,"Not the best of the Mass Effect series but it definitely doesn't deserve anything under a 5/10. Anything rated below are reviews based on bias opinion and nothing more. The gameplay has changed since the 1st two installments. AI and shooting mechanics have been largely improved but to the disappointment to most fans of the 1st game, the gameplay has evolved into more a shooter than RPG style. Skill building has actually improved from ME2 as now there are a lot more ways to evolve your squads abilities. In my personal opinion I enjoyed the story and I don't need to debate why. It seems like it's always a question of why I don't hate it. Your choices from the previous games are reflected all throughout the game but some choices within ME3's story aren't reflected where they should be. Now, to criticize on the actual flaws of ME3 (*note: these are mostly opinion). My #1 issue w/ it is the absence of Jack Wall. Suicide Mission/ The End Run was the best composition within a video game and was at least half of the epic-ness of ME2's ending. I know he chose to leave BioWare for other projects but still: Why work w/ the 1st 2 games then bail. Also, Clint Mansell's ""Leaving Earth"" is a complete rip-off of John Murphy's compositions from the main theme of the movie ""Sunshine"". It's even in my opinion that the Observation Room aboard the Normandy was practically ripped straight from this movie. Second: Ashley's appearance. She went from a ""girl you'd bring home to mama"" to a ""don't tell my boyfriend"" kinda girl. It kinda reminds me of young pop-stars who debut as a sweet innocent teen then turn to a raunchy sleaze as soon as they hit 18. The only other thing wrong w/ this game is some slight continuity issues w/ ""some"" decisions made in previous games and so-called plot holes discovered from over-analysis but they aren't enough of an issue to lose faith in this game or the development team behind it.",7,2012-05-23,XBOX 360,user
Daedulos,"i have to say that i really did enjoy the demo when it first came out, and i really loved it when i got my hands on the limited edition of the game. the game play was solid, voice acting was perfect, graphics were tight, and the story just flowed with the series. im not saying that did not have any flaws though (which every game does have by the way), but i did feel that i didnt get the choices i really wanted at the end of it, and i would have prefered that the campaign's success did not rely on the multiplayer, which was good enough as it is, but all and all i couldnt help but fall in love with the game again, i only hope more people get to experience it too.",9,2012-05-22,XBOX 360,user
tigger,"I know lots of gamers think that the ending is very disappointing, but Bioware will bring the extended cut and then I decide about the ending-thing. Besides that ME3 is a solid third part of the franchise with good graphics, great voice acting, good story and perfect gameplay. Its multiplayer is also very addictive and you can have hours of fun with it. Great game, could be better but I love it and I am a big fan since the first Mass Effect.",10,2012-05-22,XBOX 360,user

TheMailman98,"Rated a five because of the lacking single player. I'm fine with the addition of multiplayer and the ability to play as another species in the online mode it a nice touch, but it seems to take away from what Mass effect is all about. The single player. With half of the game basically based on multiplayer, the other half focused on single player isn't nearly as interesting to play as the previous two games. If you want a good co-op multiplayer game then go ahead and get it, but the single player isn't as good as Mass effect one and two so don't get too excited.",5,2012-05-21,XBOX 360,user

xGAMERxx,"Bioware has outdone themselves, this is an amazing game. But of course nothing is perfect. Like most other people, I too was disappointed with the terrible ending. But aside from the last 15 minutes or so, this game was truly amazing. Mass effect 3 starts where 2 left off. The reapers are coming at full force and it's up to Shepard to save the entire galaxy. If you haven't already, I suggest that you pick up mass effect 1 and 2 and play them in order so everything falls into place, just so you won't end up confused (and you will get to meet some awesome characters along the way.) The thing I love most about mass effect is the characters. You actually start caring for the characters, each character has their own individual personality, you feel sad for the character, happy, and hey you might even be attracted to them. You could continue relationships from Mass effect 1-2 and it is really satisfying to see your character, and others develop. As i've said before the story is great aside from the last 15 mins. It really pulls you in and you just can't wait to see what happens next. The gameplay is a lot more fast paced compared to its predecessors but it works. All in all Mass effect 3 is a great game. it's a lot of fun, from seeing all of the awesome characters develop, to choosing to be a hero or a jerk, to the combat. This game receives a 9 from me. I took a point off for the unsatisfying ending.",9,2012-05-20,XBOX 360,user

Fullmetal,"I have to address the elephant in the room. Many of the users who gave this game a negative review might not have understood what the ending signified. With that said, I will not reveal here what it means. That is for those who complete the game and have questions to try and solve. The fact of the matter is that this game had such a large scale of intergalactic drama that it was byfar the best Mass Effect to date. The amount of time invested in the game was a complete payoff to what I discovered about the end of the game. The fact that fans didn't understand the ending is a problem though. Hopefully, Bioware will release something to let everyone know what I discovered after looking into the game deeper. I'm not going to bash anyone who didn't like the game, but I urge them to wait and see. It really is an intelligent ending to a game. Just look at Knights of the Old Republic 2's ending. It was a total WTF moment, and fans really didn't freak out about that. If you want an ending that isn't roses and tulips, play this one to the end. Go on game help sites to figure out how to get the best ending. You won't regret it.",10,2012-05-20,XBOX 360,user
John117,"This game was a huge disappointment. The combat was boring, the story was terrible, and the ending essentially ruined the previous two games for me. Mass effect 2 was dumbed down from ME1, but it was still a pretty good game. This one takes it ten steps further. ""Action mode"" says it all. The graphics are worse as well, many of the landscapes look blocky, the water looks **** list goes on. I don't know what happened, if some of the better writers left between games, but the story in this one is cringe-worthy at every turn with few exceptions. I'd have rather this game had not even came out, which is saying a lot since I'd been looking forward to this conclusion of commander Shepard's story for the past 5 years or so.

RS13,"Suppose I told you a story: Big bad guys invaded the galaxy, alone hero struggled to unite the galaxy in opposition to the baddies. The baddies weakness is discovered. There's a final showdown with the baddies above the hero's home planet. The baddies lose. Suppose I told you this story: Big bad guys invade the galaxy and no one can stop them. But in the darkest hour plans for a super weapon is discovered. Now our heroes must race to complete the weapon, before there's no galaxy left to save. The first one's probably a little better, but each is a decent story right? Now suppose I told you they were the *same* story. Wait, what? And suppose I told you that this story was made by a developer that prides itself on making ""Story-based gaming."" ""Ha!"" you'd say ""that would be a terrible story. Each story gets to the same conclusion, so putting them together renders half of the story useless."" ""Besides, the stories are really incompatible. The first is more about a single character. The second is more about teams of scientists and engineers and the soldiers who buy them time. In the second the bad guys are unstoppable in the first they're just hard to stop. In the second the galaxy would be throwing everything they had at the enemy, just to slow them down for a bit. In the first, those troops need to be saved for the final battle."" And now you'd realize this isn't hypothetical. Forget what you've heard about the ending. Mass effect 3's story just isn't any good. (And if you're wondering the half that you *play* is the half that gets rendered useless.) Toss in the facts that: -31 of the 68 ME3 missions are fetch quests (For comparison ME1 had 5 fetch quests and ME2 had 11) -The ending you get depends on how many of these fetch quests you do, though not in any narratively coherent way (you get a better ending the more you do). -It is impossible to get the best ending without playing multiplayer (YES, that's right. The ending to a three game single player story depends on whether you want to play multiplayer.) -Of the 15 possible surviving squad mates you get no more than 4 back. -Most of your decisions in ME1 and 2 are irrelevant, including some of the biggest decisions in the game. -Your dialogue options are more limited, often including only a top and bottom choice and Shepard sometimes speaks without you having any control over what he says. -None of Cerberus's interactions with Shepard make any sense. What's their endgame? Why do they care if Shepard unites the galaxy? And of course, -The terrible ending. To be fair, ME3 did have much better combat than ME1 or 2 and some of the missions (Rannoch and Tuchanka) are among the best in the series, but those two points do not a good game make. Combat's a side issue in Mass Effect and those missions are part of a larger story that utterly fails.",3,2012-05-20,XBOX 360,user

Dr2Bricks,"Some of the reviews on here are ludicrous. OK the last 15 minutes of at 30+ hour single player campaign may not appeal to everyone, but the rest of it is brilliant, stunning and engaging. This tops off the best ever game series. Add to this that the multiplayer element is more fun than you can shake a stick at. I'm not one for CoD online as I get pasted but this team based multiplayer game provides a fantastic alternative. I for one am re-playing the main campaign as a different class (oh yes, not a solder this time but a biotic with jedi knight like powers). After that maybe as an engineer. There's so much that's good about this game that no one should let the criticism of the game ending put you off. If you've not played 1 and 2 then by all means buy them, as they give context to this game, but it does work on it's own.

Hybridiction,"This is the score the game actually deserves. Now before you down-vote me, you will find if you average around the fifty + critic scores the game received it would be around the 89-93 area. Take off the moronic user score feature metacritic, it is used as a tool by a bunch of forum trolls and butthurt fanboys who really have no clue how to review a game. Of course this review will be down-voted by them, and I'll probably be called a ""**** up"" to the gaming media, but let's look at the facts first. High expectations almost always lead to disappointment, and those who have insanely high expectations will always be disappointed. This is why when you look at a game objectively, or rather as it is, instead of what you wanted it to be, you would find that it truly is a good game. Whether you disagreed with the ending or had problems because you ""Felt"" that the choices you made in the previous installments weren't reflected enough, it really doesn't matter. It's no reason to give this game a score below 7, and the fact that this game is rated a 3.9 is really quite pathetic. To even think that this game is only worth a ""3.9"" you would have to be some grumpy old man living in some old folks home or some kid who stays in his room all day, has no friends and doesn't know how to enjoy quality entertainment. The decisions you made in the previous games do reflect in this one, and yes they matter. Characters that die in ME2 wont be around, characters you saved in ME1 do make an appearance and yes your choices DID have reflect in ME3. Name a game that carries the choices you made from game to game on the same level mass effect has? You cant, there is only stand alone games with choices like the witcher 2, but what game from sequel to sequel to sequel does what the ME series has?. The fact people cry because they feel that their choices never meant anything is LAUGHABLE seeing as how they have nothing to compare it to. Give mass effect some credit, it has done a pretty damned good job. The ending to the series is fine, and honestly it really doesn't matter what bioware did people would have cried and crapped their pants. Everybody has a different idea of how it should have ""ended"" Bioware cant possibly meet everybody's expectations. The gameplay was much improved from the previous two, they added in some more RPG elements, still not as robust as ME1 but pretty close with the talent choices, weapon mods and tons of armor and loot to find. Mass effect 3 is a good game that sold well and that the majority of people enjoyed playing, don't listen to the vocal minority of idiots on here who probably pirated the game or never even played it at all and are just jumping on the hate bandwagon to hate the game like it's some ""fad"" to do so or makes them ""cool and different"" ****, sit down and enjoy the game.

WiteFalcon,"My favourite gaming franchise, I loved Mass Effects 1-3 so much, that I have 5 characters and have completed minimum of 4 playthroughs through ME1 & 2. Mass Effect 3 is an AWESOME game, no doubt about it. It's setting the standard for story based games and RPGs, now and for the future. Although I didn't mind the ending, I found it cool actually, it could of been WAY more awesome, by including prior decisions into the outcome of the ending and leaves things out. Pros: - Hooks you in with all elements (Even if your new to the series) - Great refined gameplay! (This game is pretty much Gears of War except more sci-fi and with RPG gameplay and story shaping) - Shape the story to how you want (This includes a lot of prior decisions made, unlike most games your previous saves matter!) - Great sense of characterisation for who you play as! (You really feel as if you are Shepard) Cons: - New players forced for a few elements of the game to occur (Which they have no choice over as they don't have a previous save file for the game to recognise) (Such as Wrex's death) - Crew development was a lot better in Mass Effect 2 (Its less about other people and more about Shepard) - Ending is confusing (Many people would agree, but it doesn't ruin the ending, just leaves blanks for you to imagine to fill in) - The game doesn't take into account EVERYTHING you've done in previous games, and areas are left unturned, and the ending doesn't take into account prior choices. All in all, an incredible experience that has changed the world of gaming forever and succeeds highly, but could of strived for complete perfection. Hence the 9 instead of perfect 10.",9,2012-05-17,XBOX 360,user
enFenix,"Despite having a rough start, with some hiccups along the way, and a troubled finish to the series, I thoroughly enjoyed the game. Granted, I went into playing this game being aware that there was a very large outcry of complaints regarding the endings available in the game. With that in mind, I was prepped for a very disappointing ending to the title and the series. Regarding the endings, I will say this one non-spoiling thing: They're not half as bad as the die-hards are suggesting. The game makes suggestions throughout it's entire story about what would be on the table in the last few moments of the story, so I'm unaware why people were so shocked. The diversity of endings, in my opinion, were nothing different from the previous installations. Mass Effect 1 & 2 both had endings which varried SLIGHTLY depending on many of the players decisions throughout the titles, however the major results of each of the original 2 titles endings never changed. The diversity was in supporting details. So my thoughts regarding the backlash of the chosen ending of the game is for people to stop complaining and enjoy the game for what it is. Outside of the more controversial issue, the story of the game is wonderfully written, and incorporates many facets of the original 2 games, including the decisions made by the player in the original titles. The details surrounding the core plot of the game during my play-through vastly differed from that of my friends experience. I was impressed by the games potential for diversity in ancillary details. Graphically, to be honest, I feel the engine has hit it's apex and is beginning to age. However, it was still a visually-enjoyable game. The game-play experience itself was well fleshed-out, although I feel the second instalment of the series takes the crown in this category. The side-quest of searching through the galaxy for bonus resources/items/etc was very basic and un-interesting. The combat system seemed to be a little flawed this time around, where actions I expected my character would make were not, well, made. The voice-recognition for the Kinect was fun for a bit, but then become an irritation. That is my own personal experience, others may enjoy it greatly. Overall, I suggest you be aware that the ending has some controversy around it, and otherwise enjoy this game for everything it offers between the start and the finish.",8,2012-05-16,XBOX 360,user

Nizzy,"If you are looking for a game that gives you a real sense of accomplishment at the end, ME3 is not the game for you. That being said, the rest of the game is top-notch. I would have liked more characters as well, but complaining about wanting more out of your game says a lot about how well what is there really is. Multiplayer gameplay in particular is superb with a simple design that nonetheless manages to remain fresh and different every match. Add to that the sound quality which is phenomenal; monsters sound monstrous, robots and technology sounds are totally immursive, and the voicework is entirely organic with no sense of separate sound stages strung together. Is the last 10 minutes bad enough to ruin the rest of the game? Maybe. I don't really have any argument against the opinions of all those who gave it a ""0,"" but for me it remains a solid game I'll probably play again; I just try not to think about the emptiness I know will come when I am done.",7,2012-05-16,XBOX 360,user

Naglfar,"A fantastic conclusion to the best sci fi rpg saga to take place on home consoles. Mass Effect 3's inclusion of all your decisions from the first two games and their DLC is an amazing achievement and adds a deeper affection for you character and his/her surviving allies from it's predecessors. The combat has been improved over Mass Effect 2 to be more responsive and free moving but still includes the weapon and thermal clip progressions made in that title. The graphics have improved again giving the game more feeling from being on an ominous dark space station to a foreign planets landscape it all looks stunning. The multiplayer is also compelling with a Gears Of War style 'Horde' mode in which four players can fight waves of enemies from varying factions Cerberus/Reaper/Geth to level up their favoured character class/race and earn money to buy card packs which unlock random weapons/characters/upgrades in an addictive one more game fashion.

jZero,"Mass Effect 3 is a GREAT game with just a few problems. THE GOOD: The fighting and action in this game are to me definitely the best in the series. The enemies are harder, smarter and especially near the end of the game overwhelming (in a good way.) I feel the RPG elements are done pretty well with the decisions of the past games actually effect what you can/ can't do in this game. Graphics are great and the sound is very well done. THE BAD: There were some polish issues in this game: a broken turret (wouldn't die) made me replay a level, there was a galaxy that blinked even though there was nothing to do, and other similar issues. I felt that some of the characters were just kind of thrown in just because they were in the previous games with no real story or purpose. The ending.. while not as bad as people make it to be, could've been much better. My biggest problem with the ending is that for a game with so much choice and different paths/ results the endings were all the same, literally they just changed the color of the explosion. And you are left hanging as to the aftermath for the Normandy, other galaxies, etc. That said this game is MUCH BETTER than people give it credit, people are way too harsh.

Mark_Walrusburg,"I cannot believe this is what happened to the series. I made three different Shepard's, plugged in hours crafting each one for a specific play through. I held off on playing the game until I was done with this semester of classes because I wanted to seriously throw myself in. I've been dreading it because of what I've been hearing about the fiasco of an ending. Well I finally sat down and played it, DAY 1 DLC included on my purchase because EA believes unfinished games being released are a great way to introduce content. Well never again. I have been following Bioware since knights of the old republic and I've enjoyed nearly every game (Dragon Age 2 excluded) flaws and all. Mass Effect 3 however, has somehow managed to instill a serious and incredibly ANNOYING sense of betrayal. How can a game company betray me? I'm not asking as though, ""HOW COULD YOU DO THIS ME BIOWARE??"" It's more, ""No no this makes no sense, you are not an individual capable of actually betraying me Bioware, you are a game company. The concept is ridiculous."" But even so! It's as if an old friend suddenly spit in my face and left smiling after I handed him seventy dollars. It's that feeling that has me just so disgusted that I would even feel like that over a video game. I was genuinely invested in this series and now I'm left just mulling over from time to time how horrible it was at the end. My choices didn't matter, my time put into the series had no real effect on the outcome. Killing or saving the Rachni Queen has no real impact. Uniting the Geth and the Quarian's has no real impact. The replay value of this game in my opinion is non-existent. My three Shepards have no genuine purpose other than to succumb to the will **** star child that shows up at the last ten minutes of the game. Why are there such massive plot holes in this final installment? If the Mass Relays exploding don't wipe out billions of lives and strand countless more can't the writers see how sloppy their work is? I've never made a review before, and this is my first time posting on metacritic. This final game to a wonderful series has left me with a bitter taste and a hole in my wallet.

I won't mention these things as most people already know about these issues and I don't want to spoil. I have every DLC for every Mass Effect and the conclusions literally just tossed it all out of the **** for multiplayer, it isn't bad, but it isn't good either. Lack of different modes coupled with a small selection of maps with few enemy variations is just too repetitive. Bioware also hasn't helped by openly criticizing the fans for caring and one said that the fans ""aren't producers!"" This is true, but following the atrocious ending (in my opinion) Bioware should've looked more closely at it, from a fan's point of view. How can you miss your own lore!? The free multiplayer release didn't really help and the extended ending won't fix what most of the fans have problems with, nor will these free DLCs lighten my mood for paying 10$ for a half hour mission. I am sorry, but that is where I stand...",7,2012-05-08,XBOX 360,user
LordKinoda,"Mass Effect 3 is still a great game, however, it falls short in the end. There are some great additions, and just a little too many subtractions. I love the way the guns sound and 'hit' in this game, that was a great little mod. They got rid of 'heavy' weapons except in certain plot points, also nice. You can actually carry all weapons, and not just a select few according to your class, nice. Biotic powers are great as well, love the new sounds and moves. Sprinting is essentially unlimited, which is more realistic, especially for a cybernetically altered soldier like Shepard. They slimmed down the 'scanning for resources' minigame, definitely better. Did away with the silly hacking minigames and just showing the omni-tool animation, this is cool too. So all said and done the gameplay is improved on almost all levels. Love that they brought Ashley/Kaiden back. **** not to have a romance option in Mass Effect 2. However their interactions with Shepard could of been a little more. More is always better when it comes to character development, especially when it comes to romances in a world where you're all set to be the savior of the galaxy. Shepard needs something 'real' to fight for. They do have Shepard say this, just wanted more interaction is all. Now for the bad. It feels like a lot of the dialog choices were taken away. Way too many instances where there is only 'good' and 'evil' selections. That 'neutral' option is needed sometimes because it just fits better. Rarely any 'paragon' or 'renegade' choices (the blue and red text ones) to use in the dialog as well. The graphics still **** in a lot of places though. Don't know why they couldn't of fixed this somehow. The textures are blurry and lackluster for almost all 'clothing' in the game. The armors are mostly great, but anybody who isn't wearing any has a skewed look to them. Day 1 DLC, honestly I could care less. I bought the collector's edition so it came with the game. I paid more money yes, but so what ? I like this game and didn't mind shelling out for it. The story is still great, though like many others I'm not in love with the ending either. I won't sit here and say they should come out with DLC to 'fix' it. It's not so terrible that it ruins the entire game. However I will say that the game would of received a rating of 9 from me had it ended somewhere closer to what I would of liked to see happen. Sorry. All in all, still a great game, but arguably so.",7,2012-05-07,XBOX 360,user

Would I have liked the ME series to end a bit different? absolutely, but the fact is how the game ends leaves plenty of room for interpretation(which is a trend that we gamers are the cause of). Hopefully the coming extended cut DLC will bring more closure to fans that wanted to see the effects that their Shepard had on the Galaxy.

sheepishdolphin,"Ignore the stupid reviews sub 7. This is a fantastic game. Everything is improved- the storylines are fantastic. The set pieces are enjoyable. There are big decisions to make. Each mission, unlike previous games, features a unique, totally different environment which are amazingly well realised and lovingly crafted. The soundtrack is sublime and the voice acting ranges from good to fantastic. The controls are pretty much spot on, and each character class means that there is a style of play to suit every player. I love using biotic abilities, throwing enemies around and letting my team finish them while they are in the air. Basically you are going around the galaxy assembling forces and 'assests' for the impending galactic war.Multiplayer is pretty good, it is skanky that you basically need to play it to get the best endings, but it is a good diversion. And the ending.. taken at face value, it is pretty poor, but fitting I thought. However, look up online about a theory with regards to the ending. There are hits and titbits throughout the game which explain the ending, seal the holes, and turn it from being pretty lame into damn clever as hell- for players who are insightful enough to figure it out. Right now I'm nearing the end of my 2nd playthough, straight after finishing it a first time. This is the defining game of this generation, with the best storytelling to grace a video game, fantastic locations, and fun-can't put it down gameplay.

resolent,"The Mass Effect franchise started strongly with ME1, a combination RPG shooter that while a little wooden at times, was an engaging and entertaining game. ME2 built on this, adding flesh to the story and depth to the galaxy while improving slightly on the slightly awkward combat dynamic of ME1. ME3 has bettered it's forebears, with a fluid combat system, improved interface and truly engrossing story. Further, the added multiplayer element offers brilliant gameplay and well thought out locations to enjoy with friends. The graphics and cut-scenes are high end throughout and the soundtrack at times breathtaking. Given the number of decisions made in the journey from ME1 to ME3's ending, the limited number of ending options is a little disappointing, but overall this is a strong finish to the ME series.",9,2012-05-04,XBOX 360,user
CrAEckY,"First of all i like to say that ""Mass Effect 3"" is one of the best games ever made in my opinion, even the whole series is awesome. As the reaction of many gamers shows, i am not alone who expected a marvelous finale at the end of this Sci-Fi Triology! And what have i became? A crappy nonsense telling end, that is it. That was the great announced final? I do not think so, i do not get it! So i have rated the game with 2/10 not in case of the gameplay or atmosphere, i did it, because the ending really pissed me off like most of you and EA/Bioware's Statement handled us, the Fans/Gamers like idiots and ignored our support over the last 5 years. I mean, look at all the feature's they have promised. At the end, none of the decisions i have made during the first two parts is considered. What happened at all? You can choose like in ""Deus Ex 3"" between 3 endings. Do not tell me that i have to level my readiness til 5000 pts.+ or my renegade/paragon bar to the max. Treat gamers like that is perky and unforgettable!

So, i have decided for my own that i will not support such ignorant policy again and i have canceled my SWToR-Account too. I do not buy a game of EA and Bioware again, til that Day ""Mass Effect 3"" will become some real endings, belongs to the choices i have made! My suggestion for you, do the same!

shachenau,"The gameplay itself is a vast improvement on its predecessors, keeping the actiony flow of Mass Effect 2 while both bringing back the more in-depth RPG elements of the first Mass Effect and relaxing some of the series' questionable class-based weapon restrictions. It is long, and for the most part, it is enjoyable, with a surprisingly well-implemented multiplayer facet that is vaguely reminiscent of Payday: The Heist. These technical improvements do not stop it from being the weakest and least inspiring installation of the series, however, decorating its plot with a slew of empty ""consequences"" of actions past and its exploration with an absence of content-- Mako exploration was ill-received, and planet-scanning was ill-received, but instead of attempting a compromise or a new system, exploration was mostly rendered inconsequential. The Citadel remains the only re-visitable area of interest, while galactic exploration is turned into a mild annoyance and the rest of the explorable galaxy is turned into setpieces. There is one critical mistake made in this game, and that is that the integrity of the gameplay was sacrificed for the integrity of the setting and plot. The steps taken to make the Reapers feel like an actual threat simply serve to make various segments of the game annoying at best and frustrating at worst. Players invested in the first two games have a pretty substantial likelihood of being frustrated and upset by Bioware's insistence on compromising the more rewarding aspects of decision-making and exploration in exchange for a more ""believable"" setting, improved combat being the only net positive of this trilogy-ender.",6,2012-04-29,XBOX 360,user

A few boss battle's difficulty are 10x higher than the rest of the game (or even the level they're on). And using the A button for everything is infuriating, especially on multiplayer when you NEED to revive a team mate, but instead you send your character into cover and everyone dies.

O que falar entao de Mass Effect sem parecer um fanboy? Historia irada, personagens incriveis, tecnica perfeita, mecanica anos luz a frente do primeiro e jah sensacional Mass Effect original. Eh Mass Effect 3 eh muito melhor do que eu imaginava, o unico jogo longo que estava torcendo pra nao acabar, nao por causa do final polemico (ate pq achei sensacional) mas porque eu sei que ao fechar seria o fim, e eu realmente nao queria o fim. Sheppard, Garrus, Thane, Jack, eu realmente vou sentir falta deles, sao personagens que me envolvi e o mais sensacional evoluiram ao longo da historia. Tenho uma coisa a dizer, Bioware muito obrigado pela experiencia, pelos momentos de indecisao de ficar por minutos pensando nas consequencias de minhas acoes, muito obrigado pela estadia na Normandy. Mass Effect 3 tem ainda um bom adendo o multiplayer, nao eh algo sensacional mas devido ao incrivel background torna a experiencia bacana, Quero muito DLCs muito mesmo, e as vezes fico imaginando plots indivduais para cada personagem.

OverDos,"Everybody needs to take a chill pill. Don't bash the game because of personal opinion towards subjects unrelated to the game's final product. The point of a User Review isn't to complain about a company, its about to rate a game so potential buyers know what they're getting themselves into. Anyway, I think the game is solid, but is the weakest in the series. However, that isn't saying much since i'd give the last two games 10/10's. Mass Effect 3 really is a great game with a breathtaking storyline, but it missed the mark in terms of how innovative the game truly could have been. The differences between the first and second games were huge. So many things had changed for the better, and, in my opinion, some things had been changed for the worst. Instead of correcting mistakes made previously in Mass Effect 2, EA chose to use an almost identical mold for the third game. The potential of learning from the first and second games' mistakes was virtually ignored. I suppose in the end though, the game was fun and it was worth the buy. I just they did more with it. As for the dreaded ending that everybody is up in arms about, it isn't as bad as people claim it to be. The game's grand finale is whatever you make of it. Chances are it wont end the way you had imagined it would and therefore you might not like it. The fact of the matter is, the developers designed an ending that they believed was appropriate. Whether or not you accept that is up to you. I didn't think it was all that bad.

SaltyRT,"Let me begin by saying that Mass Effect 3 is an excellent game, and is worthy of the five star rating I have assigned to it. However, you may have heard some lackluster comments about the ending, and yes, the ending was a disappointment for me, as well as many others, but this doesn't detract much from the rest of the game. The gun play has been refined to the point of near perfection, and the RPG elements have been expanded upon from Mass Effect 2, though still not as in-depth as Mass Effect, which in my opinion was a bit too complex. However, it feels as if the game took a hit in the story department, limiting your overall choices in conversations by removing the neutral options. It may seem as if I'm complaining about the story, but across all three games, it's still one of the best stories ever told in gaming. (And if you're concerned about the ending, Bioware has confirmed that a free DLC titled ""Extended Cut"" will be released this summer, hopefully putting an end to everyone's ending woes.) While Mass Effect 3 may not be as amazing as it's predecessor, Mass Effect 2, they are both definitely worthy of being on the list of the best games I have ever played. 9.7/10",10,2012-04-24,XBOX 360,user

TookYoCookies,"Terrible ending, devolution of game play, auto dialogue.. It's clear EA wanted this game made to cater to the most broad, widest, biggest, general audience possible and in doing so destroyed what made the game good to begin with. The unique setting,story, and character interaction blended with third person shooter action made Mass Effect 1 and 2, two of the greatest games of all time, and lead to Mass Effect 3 being one of the most anticipated games of all time. Despite the great critical and commercial success of the first two entries in the ME trilogy that most game developers could only dream of, EA and Bioware wanted to broaden the target audience to appeal to a much wider demographic, and in doing so, shot them selves, and the ME fiction in the foot; effectively killing what could very well have been the greatest trilogy of games the medium had ever seen. The uniqueness of the game, and cohesion of the story, were sacrificed for something that only die-hard, mountain dew chugging Michael Bay fans would be proud of. In their commercially driven motivation for Mass Effect 3, Bioware made the mistake of thinking that making the game more like the handful of other action-oriented shooters out there would make this game better; which was a tremendous mistake. the unique blend of story, characters, player driven narrative, impactful decisions made by the player, and solid TPS action is what made the game so popular. Attempting to make the game like every other TPS game out there, turned a master piece into just another bland, white/black, piece of gaming mediocrity. The most sad part of it all, is just the fact that had they stayed the course, the ME universe wouldve remained a cash-cow for years and years to come. EA has showed incompetence on a major level in the past 5 years of gaming, and their lack of foresight on this game alone goes above and beyond ""dropping the ball"". This kind of blunder in any other industry would see entire executive boards sacked, and call for serious coming-to-jesus meetings within the company to determine where they went wrong and how to make it right. Time to stop focusing on marketing, and start actually making good games.

TheTelePlus,"Coming into ME3 I was very much expecting a car crash, an unplayable, uninteresting mess not even worth my time. I guess that shows you really can't trust either end of the spectrum these days, Critics were praising it as the second coming of the Christ where as the vast majority of fans were claiming it was the worst game since Superman64. In reality ME3 is neither of these. Where as ME1 was an RPG that felt like a bad TPS and ME2 was just plain bad ME3 strikes the perfect balance between being an RPG and TPS, significantly more weapons and armour than ME2 also offer some nice replay value for completionists looking to collect everything. Unfortunately the story seems to have gotten worse in pretty much every way conceivable, sure there are some great scenes that tap into the ME1 and to a lesser extent ME2 nostalgia but they're just that, scenes. ME3 has the least amount of interactive conversations of the entire series, which just plain ****. Most scenes play out similar to the Normandy conversations with Zaeed in ME2, the frequency of these is kind of annoying when you look back at ME1 which had an abundance of in-depth conversations with most of the throw-away characters, this in conjunction with it's terrible, terrible ending mean it's hard to recommend ME3 to fans of the series and really there are a great deal more, and better story driven TPS out there if you're coming to ME3 for a shooter. Then there's the multiplayer, let me sum up the multiplayer with a single clause. The multiplayer clearly detracted from the quality of the single-player and ME3 would have been a better game had it not existed. Overall It's hard to recommend ME3 to anyone, it relies too heavily on series nostalgia to be enjoyable for people looking to get into the series this late and isn't a particularly great shooter either.

Storyline aside, my rationale for giving the low score is due to the fact that they have changed an important game mechanic... the ability to holster your weapon during breaks in combat. This is something that was available in ME1 and ME2, and the lack of it in ME3 seriously breaks the flow and makes the game less enjoyable. In the previous installments you would have a battle, then holster you gun and explore, then if more baddies cropped up, you would draw your gun again. This is much more realistic than ALWAYS having your gun drawn. Fighting bad guys? Gun drawn. No bad guys around? Gun drawn. Exploring crates? Gun drawn. Talking to teammates? Gun drawn. No one else on your team has their gun drawn? Gun drawn. It is a HUGE flaw in an otherwise good game, and I am shocked that Bioware removed it.

acisawesome,"Ah yes ""Mass Effect is an awful game series"", I have dismissed that claim. ME3 brings in quite a few innovations to the table since ME2, and I think that it brings in almost all of your major choices from previous games amazingly. The combat is quite similar to the untrained eye, and, even though that would be a good thing anyway (ME2's combat system was sublime) it's not true. Combat it ME3 is much more brutal, difficult and it forces you to make use of its environments (which are a much more 3-dimensional setting than previous games. One mission in it particular forces you to pull out every trick you have in an attempt to survive long enough to finish (immensely difficult on insanity). The combat it also much more cinematic, being able to pull enemies over cover near you at either stab them, crush them, or a variety of other things much to my humor. The story (ending excluded, is one of, if not the best writing in games I have ever played, pulling at emotional heart strings, but with enough witty dialogue to keep it from being depressing. In response to the ending controversy, is the ending good, god no, does it makes sense, again no, but does it ruin the entire series, or even the game? No, do you know what I did when I finished ME3? I sat down and played it again. Then I went out and bought points for the ""From Ashes"" DLC, (not necessary, but I would recommend it, it adds to the story and adds some interesting dialogue) got that onto the game, but I didn't play it as soon as I got that. I went back to ME1and started the whole series again (that's about 40 hours a game, 50 if your going for everything like I was). And I still loved the journey as Commander Shepard, even though the ending was lack luster. The multiplayer is surprisingly good, and I found myself surprised at how much I was enjoying it, though it is harder than the single player campaign, and with the free ""Resensurgence"" DLC that was released earlier, its only getting better, the only fault is it doesn't show your total play time, but I can forgive that. So, in the end Mass Effect 3 is a modern triumph in games, with some faults (ending, and loss of SOME dialogue options (though you still retain most of them)). Take this review from a fan who has put over a thousand hours into Mass Effect, over a thousand hours into EACH Mass Effect and that isn't including the multiplayer, this game is great, perfect? No, but still a modern miracle in the gaming. As a side note, all of these awful reviews (the 0, and 1's) are from fans who feel cheated by the ending, and are so angry that they cant see that the journey there is magnificent. Some of them are right about it, but they have far to harshly judged it. e.g. the ending is awful, I can never play Mass Effect again 0/10; which I proved wasn't always true in this review. All I can do now is urge you to buy this game (and the others as well, they make it better, especially if you save a guy called Wrex in the first game, his dialogue is amazing).",10,2012-04-21,XBOX 360,user

grassninja,"PAY NO ATTENTION TO ALL OF THE NEGATIVE HYPE. Yes, the ending of this game **** sweaty donkey taint, especially if you've played since ME1, but that's 10 minutes out of 30+ hours of game. Everything leading up to the ending is well worth the money spent. This game is not perfect. Characters will stare off into space while talking, some squad mates will just run out and stand in front of enemies needing to constantly be revived, some conversations just cut out midway through, the DLC feels like a half-assed and pointless afterthought, but the positive FAR outweighs the negative. If you want a good, satisfying story with a **** Disney ending go watch the Lion King. I hate EA, I was pissed about the day 1 DLC shenanigans, and I""M VERY PISSED about the horrible ending, but I still loved playing this game.",9,2012-04-20,XBOX 360,user
jonahlee,"I have been a huge fan of this series and bought the collector's edition of all 3 games, but after finishing Mass Effect 3 I have not only lost all interest in the series, but will never be playing another BioWare game. The ending negates everything you did in all 3 games, and doesn't take into account anything that you did along the way, it just comes down to 3 arbitrary choices, all of which are bad, and make no sense. And it is too bad, because I honestly thought this was the best game I ever played until I hit the end, but seeing the 3 endings provided (really one ending with some variations) has left an empty feeling in my stomach, and ruined the entire story for me. I will not pay for any more download content (which is how the game ends telling you to wait for download content that will be coming), nor playing another BioWare game ever again. I just don't understand how the game could not only not allow the choice that the whole series is built on, but also not even seem to understand what you had accomplished in the game. If you are a fan of the series and have not picked it up, don't, let your good image of this game not be tarnished by this awful ending!",0,2012-04-20,XBOX 360,user

thezeppo1138,"Despite a few flaws, such as the codex not updating and and some graphical glitches, Mass Effect 3 is an awesome game. Very intense and highly emotional. I have even been playing the multiplayer a lot more than I thought. As for the ending, the the only thing that really bothered me about it was some continuity issues and such that made it feel lazily put together. That is a little disappointing because the rest of the games writing is so on point and some of the best you will see in the genre. They are working on fixing it though. But overall a great experience and amazing conclusion to the trilogy. Highly recommended.",8,2012-04-19,XBOX 360,user

The move away from RPG components and lack of decisions are downsides, but the only reason this game fall short of a ten, for me, is the stupid ending.

sup3lolzx,"BEST GAME EVER until the end... Mass Effect 3 i the best si-fi story out there. its so inmersive the characters, the universe, your Shepard, you care and love evry thing and evry one. it haves about 20-28 hours of gameplay if you take your time, if you just play the main missions is about 10-13 hours. the gameplay is the best of the series and the cinematics and voice actiing is the best there is. Down side You have much lees squad members than in ME2 and one of them is a day ONE dlc The ending OK the ending is full of plotholes, imagine if The Lord Of The Rings would have ended when frodo was about to destroy the ring. and thats it it dosent tell you WTF happend to you, your friends your romance(if you have one), you flet... NOTHING and its EAs fault, the made the game end in a cliffhanger so you buy the next DLC or game is BS i can take the lack of squadmates since when you interact with your squadmates its more intresting than in ME1 or 2 but that ending makes you not want to play the game agin... i went on a FULL ON RAGE QUIT deleted my first save started a new one and not going to finish it agin until the extended cut DLC and hope that the next gamplay DLC it isint pre-end DLC like ME1 HOLD THE LINE ask for a well explaind ending with no plot holes and pos-ending DLC and more gameplay like in ME2 where you can keep playing after finishing the game. my hope is still up dont give the game a bad score just becuse of the last 10 minutes, they can still fix it , its not like if the problem was gameplay or the whole story its JUST THE LAST 10 MINUTES THAT WE WANT FIXED Bioware Have a nice day, and play Multiplayer witch is GREAT until the Extended cut comes out and see whats nex for Our Commander Shepard",9,2012-04-18,XBOX 360,user

Sparpnsexyoak,"I'll keep it short and sweet on this one promise. I loved Me1, Me2 and Me3. It is quite possibly my favourite set of games ever made, however this being said I will concede that Mass Effect 3 had some flaws. Yes it wasn't perfect and if I'm really honest I was not blown away by the ending. To continue in this honest fashion I was expecting the worse based on internet commentary and had I ignored it I probably would have been a lot happier, but on with the review! Mass Effect 3 has a great story and incredible lore to back it up. The action in number 3 is better than either 1 or 2 and you really get the sense that the galaxy is falling apart around you. The visuals are stunning and go a long way to immersing you in the game, yes sometimes things pop in and out but when your looking up at a huge freaking planet on fire, as you gun down loads of husks standing between you and ultimate victory everything seems perfect! I couldn't live with myself if I gave it a perfect score as that would be silly, I expect flawless for that. This said users who score it a zero seriously needs to grow up a bit and be fair to the game as a whole, no game deserves that and least of all Mass Effect.",8,2012-04-18,XBOX 360,user

TStout,"This review may be a bit biased in light of a few facts: I love the previous installments in the series so much that I had really high expectations for this game, the conversation mechanic didn't feel as important in this installment as in previous games in the series since halfway through the game you don't really choose dialogue anymore, and the ending of this game turned me way off because there were too many unanswered questions. Basically all three endings were based on the last decision you make, so if you logged serious hours in the series, be ready for disappointment. There is one exception in which your Galaxy at War progress and your single player preparation come into play, but even in that case, there are an unsatisfactory amount of answers compared to my expectations for the conclusion. I do enjoy the multiplayer, but it is difficult to find matches at times which is a fatal flaw for any online cooperative play. Overall, if I didn't already own this title, I would only rent it long enough to beat the game, and I would probably wait until all the DLC packs are out so I could make the most efficient use of my time.",5,2012-04-17,XBOX 360,user

Raithix,"It would be easy for me to give into emotions and give Mass Effect 3 a low score for the same reasons many of my fellow fans have. I could rail against the ending and any number of minor nuances, but to do so would be dishonest and misleading. The fact of the matter is, for 95 percent of Mass Effect 3, the game is immaculate. Combat is precise, dialogue is to the same level it has been since the first game, and the cutscenes are absolutely stunning. Seeing the galactic war against the Reapers is breathtaking and magnificent, and was emotionally impactful in a way I have never felt from a video game before. Of course, this made the ending all that much more heartwrenching, and for emotionally invested fans of the series like myself, disappointment, depression, and anger are likely to come about. For players new to the Mass Effect series, this game has to rate a perfect 10, as it is the best installment in the series, and gives a massively immersive feel not seen in many games. For fans of the previous two games, however, it has to rate a bittersweet 7.5. A slightly railroaded plot coupled with a bizarre ending make the conclusion to the franchise a hard pill to swallow, even if the majority of the game is absolutely beautiful, whether we want to admit it or not.",9,2012-04-16,XBOX 360,user

MentalKase6288,"Overall I give the 6 and here is why: Story: Excellent! Well up until the last 10min. Pretty much when you play this game and you meet the glowing child. Just restart your Xbox and you won't have the fanchise ruined. Gameplay: Good. Single Player: The power combinations come in handy for some of the more difficult enemies. Still don't care about the limited ammo becuase it goes against the first game, exploration was significantly reduced. Miss some of the puzzle games that were introduced to in the last game (ME2). Also you seem to need to switch between disc a lot more than in Mass Effect 2 Multiplayer: Fun. No PvP, all PvE. Focus's on teamwork. Biggest complaint is the ""Store"". All new characters and weapons are random with different pack just increasing your odds. Unfortunately you don't know what items, weapons or characters are Common, Uncommon, Rare, or Ultra Rare. Bugs: A few but Significant Most notable the face import issue for characters created in Mass Effect 1 and 2. None of my characters faces I generated imported into Mass Effect 3. Even post patch, just released 4/11, imported in properly. Many gamer have experienced items being re-lock in multiplayer and game freezes.

norse,"Oh, man. So bad. The ending is horrible, but you already know that if you haven't been living under a rock. I couldn't have been worse if ""it had all been a dream"", it couldn't have been worse if everyone spontaneously broke into song for the grand finale of ME - the musical episode. Or if they'd just had the wisdom to cut out the last 20 minutes. That said, that's not why I am rating this a 0. The gameplay suffered badly from ME1 and even ME2: the main story skeleton is an unbelievable gimmick, and off that hang side missions that are at best so-so, with no choice in dialog and pretty bad animation (I mean, really, the running female Shepard?!) The side missions frequently have inconsistencies (characters appearing/disappearing, physically unlikely scenarios (someone should educate the writers about mass and energy, and how if I spent half an hour defeating a mech that can kill me with one shot, a cutscene that shows everyone standing in an open shuttle looking at said mech pointing his guns at me but not shooting for a minute is pretty stupid). I won't whine about how this could have been a great game, but it's sad to see how cheaply and easily this game could have been ten times as good.

ZacOfTheZombies,"Mass Effect 3 presents a text book example of ""Just finish it so we can sell it."" The game is riddled with cut corners; Be it sprites in the game, stock photos, plot holes deep enough to fit the Reaper Armada in, and content cut from the finished product, everything combines to paint ME3 as a sloppy, unfinished product. The gamplay is the average coverbased shooter that ME is known for. The RPG elements for the game are surprisingly better since ME2, more reminiscent of those found in ME1. The writing in the game is, like I said earlier, riddled with plotholes but still offers fleeting moments of genuine goodness which makes me wonder if someone else was in charge of them. And of course, there's the ending. Pre-release comments stated that ME3's ending wouldn't be just ""an A, B, or C choice"" and that ""player choices would really matter"", these statements are completely false. The game ends based on a final A, B, or C choice resulting in virtually identical endings, differing only in color.

LanLan,"Despite the general uproar, Mass Effect 3 has proven to be a fantastic end to a beloved series. The upset over the ending is justified, albeit largely uncalled for. The central conflict present in each of the previous games largely revolves around the animosity between synthetics and organics. While many have ignored this particular aspect of the series, the ending wholly resolves it, in a largely satisfying way. Despite this, the widely held belief that the ending is too linear is a valid one. However, Bioware is already working on new content that would hopefully present players with more options, and thus, more satisfaction. As for the rest of the game, Mass Effect 3 is a total and complete triumph. The gameplay is impecable, the presentation is spotless, and the mix of RPG elements from Mass Effect 1 and the explosive action of Mass Effect 2 results in an incredibly immersive experience. Ignore the many dissenters, frustrated by the fact that the game doesn't spell everything out for you. Leaving loose ends allows for players to create their own possibilities, a fundamental concept and a throwback to traditional role playing games. Bioware - keep doing what you do best. 10/10.",10,2012-04-13,XBOX 360,user
f_type,"""The people who are crying about the ending are overreacting,"" was my initial impression while I was still working my way through this game while having to read a forum post, website update, or blog about fan outcry about the end of the game. As I was still playing through the mid-point of the game, I thought it was fantastic. The visuals and sound are great, the combat is fantastic, and everything you love about the series is better than ever. You'll encounter some epic moments, and see all of your decisions come to fruition. My only issue, up to that point, was some outcomes were nearly impossible to change, and were based on some of the most mundane decisions made earlier in this game or in the two prior games. I thoroughly enjoyed the game... until the final moments. Unfortunately, I learned that the fans weren't overrating. The ending is, simply put, bad. In fact, I would go so far as to say it was one of the worst endings I've ever seen in my 2 decades of gaming (yes, including those old ""Congratulations! You beat the game!"" endings). For all the talk of decisions and choices, the final moments of the game were simply hollow and the ending was anything but an ending, full of plot holes and unanswered questions. For a series that spanned 3 excellent games (minus the end of this game), I was baffled as to how BioWare felt that the final parts of the game were at all satisfactory. I know I'm just preaching to the choir here, but it's all true. Mass Effect 3 was simply fantastic, until the final moments.",7,2012-04-12,XBOX 360,user
Jayosh,"Mass Effect has been an extremely amazing series, and Bioware hyped this game as the extremely exciting climax to the series. I think they deliver to a certain degree. I want to praise the actual combat in this game and even though people are whining about the lack of RPG elements I do think it's still a very fun system. It also does a really good task at dealing with a lot of the perpetual issues presented in both 1 and 2 (Krogan genophage, Geth quarian relationship, etc.). I would want to get the game after reading what I said its just, so half finished. No clue how Bioware put so little work into this game and still took so long. There are some GREAT story missions, very exciting. It's just everything else is so rushed. This game fails to appease the newcomers of the series and even the veterans who love this series with a burning passion. Interested in this game? Play Mass Effect 1 & 2 they are great games.

BioWare said that would be 16 different endings, but what we got was 3 different colors. RED BLUE or GREEN. There is no narrative coherence, the ending is filled with plot holes, ME1 and ME2 story was destroyed in a matter of minutes, they doesn't review their own games before launching? This doesn't make sense really. Why am I giving a 0? The answer is: The ending not only destroyed ME3 but the story of ME1 and ME2 too. ME3 became a action-shooter, there is only auto-dialogue, a few choices that i can count with my fingers. The game forces you to do some things, there is no roleplay anymore. I won't talk about the plotholes because in youtube you can find a lot of videos highlighting everyone one of them. They have done the same thing with DA2, they are trying to reach another kind of gamers, but to do that they are sacrificing their own fanbase. ME3 feels exactly like DA2: RUSHED. They didn't had the time to review their own creation what a crap! Hire another writer. Only your writers can screw a incredible story like ME in a matter of seconds.

Every decision I've made throughout the series felt like they mattered and I saw the effects of these choices show throughout the story being told. I often found myself doing nothing more but wandering around overhearing conversations that told even more about the story. The story is epic, well acted, and immersing. The game-play is better than ever and caters to many play styles. Like stealth, hitting hard and running away? Go for it. Standard FPS? Sure. Like the Rock/Paper/Scissor decisions of a classic RPG?

SGRevan,"The Mass Effect trilogy receives it's latest and last chapter. After starting up the game I immediately noticed big differences. You have 'less say' in the dialogue options. Comparing it to Mass Effect 1 it's a huge leap backwards. Why would you take away something that made the first one so great?! Don't get me wrong, you still have times where you have to choose between outcome A or B, and believe me when I say that those choices are immensely difficult, that because you realy care about the characters and story... also Mass Effect 3 hugely improved on the combat system, it's near perfect. You realy enjoy using the weapons and powers to take town hordes of enemies... this all on a great galactic scale while explosion and reaper invasion-sounds hurl around you. Epic, I'd say. The Multiplayer has this great combat aswel, minus the epicness that you get in the single-player ofc. ... After having several friends telling me the ending is completely out of place... I finally got to the end. I have to say, it's not THAT bad... It's still epic and the climax is there! ... but I do have to agree, it gives no closure on Shepard or everyone else around him/her. Mass Effect 3 is a great game, you notice the hard labor that Bioware made for making this title, and the Original Score + the graphical design and presentation makes this one hell of a trip into the sci-fi universe of Mass Effect. So all in all, I know the ending could've been much better, but since EA announced they will give us more closure in the near future, I believe it will make this game jump that one step higher on my personal scoreboard.",9,2012-04-08,XBOX 360,user
DANNOMAN_88,"OK- had to review this, just finished the game, and then looked at all of the bad reviews, had to throw in my 2 cents. This game is not a 0 or a 1 - not a 10, but a very good game. I suspect everyone giving it a 0 or 1 mostly hated losing a loved character that they invested so much time in and the ENDING. To me, the game felt similar to ME2, but more dramatic and BIG - I was blown away with some of the impact this game had. I really enjoyed it. I can understand how people did not like the ending, but this was a story arc that was planned from the beginning, and I can accept that the developer decided that the story arc ended like this. If Shepherd was able to live, I guess that people would be giving it a similar score to ME2. I overlooked some of the cheesiness and warts that the game has, and enjoyed the journey. I give it an edge over ME2. On one hand - much better combat, and real emotional impact for me. One the other hand - poorer writing, less free will, and some unnecessary searches for random 'war assets' that only took away from the game. THE GOOD: 1. The cinematic quality was very good. 2. The battles and action is so much better than ME1 and 2, where I felt battles were not as good as the role-playing elements. Every battle in ME3 felt felt exciting and like I had some valid options. The diverse enemies kept me on my toes. I was stuck early in the game on Regular difficulty, redoing a battle like 10 times, until I got used to the new more realistic battles, and then I was able to play most of it on a harder difficulty, and I really enjoyed the fights, instead of just trying to get through them to get back to the story. 3. Throughout much of the game, my actions from ME2 and ME3 MATTERED - I was SO pissed off and emotionally invested when my actions from the games turned out to wipe out a group of people in the game and had one of my members commit suicide. I was really upset, but that really added to the idea that my actions have ramifications. Wow, I at the time I thought that I was doing the right things, but in hindsight I could see how my decisions led to the bad result. THE BAD: 1. Too short. 2. The game does take away some control - your character has less leeway - the story and the cinematic quality of the game sacrifice some free will. 3. EA's and MSoft's money grubbing ways. I will rarely play a new game - I will play a used copy most of the time. I will never buy downloadable content on XBL for this game or another game. I will probably never pay to play games on XBL. Why? Horrible value! I don't want to be bled dry by the greedy big names. Look at the appstore model - a bunch of free and affordable entertainment. I don't regret buying this.",8,2012-04-07,XBOX 360,user
Deathmonger,"Yea, I'm gonna blast it. Hopefully Bioware will get the message, and in two years when their revenues are shot, they will for sure get it then, because I am done spending money on any of their products. ANY, including SW:TOR. This game had DLC day one. You had to play multiplayer to max war asset multiplier. Same engine, same graphics, nearly same gameplay--so all that would improve or stay status quo is plot/story, where they failed miserably. False advertising in that ""choices would matter. Ending would not be A, B, or C."" Bioware asked for feedback, then ignored it and will release free DLC extending the ending, yet fixing nothing. I cannot recommend this game to anyone. Go buy Bethesda products (Elder Scrolls/Fallout) or Anet (Guild Wars/Guild Wars 2, or heck, even Aion).",3,2012-04-07,XBOX 360,user

DavidB,"Despite the general critical acclaim, I thought this was a terribly disappointing game. I loved the first two Mass Effect games - the second one is an absolute masterpiece - and it's baffling how Bioware - who got everything so right in Mass Effect 2 - could get so many things wrong in this final part of the series. The focus is on combat - and other aspects of the game have suffered. Gone is the feeling of freedom and expansiveness of having a whole galaxy to explore - aside from main quest missions, there are no planets on which you can land, no hidden adventures to discover. And too many of the main quest missions felt unremarkable to me, indistinguishable from each other, and at times it was hard to care about what was going on. The way that side missions have been implemented in the game feels very unsatisfactory and doesn't feel fully realised at all. Don't even get me started on the way the journal works - or doesn't work; it's virtually impossible to stay on top of what you need to do, or where you need to go to do it. Item management is also a nightmare: you need to buy weapons in the game, but you're buying them in the dark, because the game offers nothing as useful as being able to compare what's on sale with the weapons your squad already has. Item management, quest management, the way that side missions work, all felt poorly realised to me. There are no new characters - oh no, sorry, there's one: a hulking space marine whose name I've forgotten he's so unremarkable. He's like a cast-off from Gears of War, dull as dishwater, as out of place in a Mass Effect game as Jack Bauer would be in an episode of The Wire. It's not all bad - the game does throw up some memorable moments, and it looks stunning - the graphics and lighting effects are excellent. But there are not enough memorable moments, and too much of the game feels like a betrayal of all that has gone before it. Mass Effect 3 feels like a game trying to be all things to all people, and ending up as a bit of a dog's breakfast. If I'm being honest, this game broke my heart. And I haven't even mentioned the ending...",5,2012-04-06,XBOX 360,user
ZHenderHill,"With all the negative hype surrounding the ending of the Mass Effect trilogy, it seems as though most players have overlooked the fact that ME3 still featured the finest gameplay of the series, as well as some of the most absorbing story lines. BioWare (now publicly maligned, but still undisputed kings of the RPG) finally got the weapon/armor customisation and resource finding to the point of being fun, the combat was more streamlined and gorgeous than ever (biotic detonations will always make me squeal with delight), and pretty much every mission I was emotionally rocked. Mass Effect stands as one of the best series of games I have played, and this was the best of the three. Admittedly, I did initially take the stance - like everyone else - of denouncing the game after experiencing the ending . Upon first impressions it came off as rushed, flawed and meaningless, leading me to become one of the fans that fell under the spell of the infamous ""indoctrination theory"" that floated around. It is a hopeful alternative to the Occam's razor that BioWare didn't put enough effort into the ending as they should have. It was definitely a disappointment video-game wise, but was also rich with existential arguments which had me pondering/arguing with friends for days after. In the end I'm not hating it as much as I thought I would. Regardless, it doesn't ruin the rest of the series - as everyone seems to be saying - or even the rest of the game, which remains one of the most exhilarating gaming experiences of recent memory. And the multiplayer isn't too shabby either!",9,2012-04-06,XBOX 360,user

1234worm,"Get it straight, Mass Effect 3 is mainstream. It's not going to have meticulous weapon and armor switching, it's not going to have open unstructured environments, it's going to be heavy-handed and blunt at times, It's depiction of relationships is blunt to put it kindly. It's going for mass appeal. ME3 is built to be accessible and fun. You'll be killing enemies in style until the ridiculous upswing in difficulty for the final few waves of enemies. All the characters play it a little too straight and the narrative isn't quite as enrapturing as ME2, but this is made up for by your ability to influence the game-world. The effects of your choices from past games are a little underwhelming, but the pay-offs for plot points from the past games like the genophage and the quarian geth conflicts are excellent. While the missions have never been more linear some of the areas, particularly those levels that take place during reaper attacks or the the climax on tuchanka are breathtakingly large in scope. There's a futility to what you are trying to do throughout and this is reinforced by these scenes of chaos and destruction. Mass Effect 3 is to the point, with smartly designed levels (i don't think i ever came close to getting lost) and refined cover based shooting, as always powers are way cooler (if you want to have fun play vanguard). The combat has never been better, although easy, it's never unwelcome. The stories are meaningful, the characters feel real. the games never played better. It's not going to be the complex rpg shooter bioware once promised (the way they makes games has changed a lot since KOTOR), but it is a different take on cover based shooters that for me is way more fun than gears of war. The ending is the most important ending of a video game, ever. i've never cared about the end **** this much. Even though it's a bit of a Sopranos ending, it's gotten a similar media swell to that ending and they do say that any press is good press. I don't really think it's good to end your story with something so controversial it creates an uproar from your most loyal fans but even if you hate the ending you have to admit no other ending would have brought this kind of attention. I've been obsessed enough with the ending that I wrote this entire review, full of important points, as fast as I possibly could so I could talk about the ending. I've never been so consumed by the ending ****. Bioware are either idiots, or the most despicable geniuses in the history of video games. Either they see a thematic reason to make the end of their final game contradict everything the series has ever been about, or they're geniuses who came up with the greatest twist ending of a video game and challenged the idea of what games could achieve as an art form. of course if they are geniuses and the games final message to the player, which promises future content, was the first step of their diabolical plan they have destroyed video games claim to status as an art form by excluding the true ending of the series in an attempt to make more money by selling it as DLC. Even if they decide to give it away it will only prove that they felt for remorse for what was going to be the most mind-bending thing to happen in a videogame.

Noobara,"Mass Effect 3 is for the most part a brilliant game and manages to balance RPG elements and Shooter mechanics even better than its predecessors. The story is for 99% of the game fantastic and concludes many of the story lines from the first 2 games. The most talked about flaw with the game is it's poor ending. the one everyone is going on about and rating the game so poorly because of. Yes the ending is not Bioware's finest moment of story telling and it might spoil the experience slightly for many people, but it should not completely put you off playing what is such a good game for the previous 30 hours of gameplay. The other major flaw with the game is that many of the characters from ME2 are strangely absent, and it would have been nice for them to feature more. Especially for PS3 owners who have less attachment to the ME1 characters than X-Box owners. Although the game lets it self down at the very end its still a game everyone should play - however its best played after completing the other 2 games as you will be far more attached to the story if you've already spent hours with Shepherd and his/her crew.",8,2012-04-03,XBOX 360,user

Balrock,"Overall one of the best rpgs ever created. No other series or game has forced me to sit there and think about the consequences of my decisions like this one. I even spent 20 minutes explaining the backstory of a decision to my girlfriend to get her opinion on what was the right thing to do. No matter what the haters of the ending say, they all played the game to the ending for a reason. They loved the series and enjoyed this game enough to see it's conclusion. The action points are fun and tense, the return of multiple previous teammates is entertaining, even the resource gathering mini-game from previous entries has been further improved to not make it so boring/repetitive. Overall, this game is an improvement in every area from the previous entries. As for the ending, I think lots of people are confusing anger at the ending vs. not having multiple endings. I believe the presented ending is well written and a nice conclusion to the series. I won't argue that there are some portions of the ending that are not well explained but I leave that up to Bioware to explore in future DLC and Mass Effect releases. However most people seem to be upset because no matter what you've done in the previous games, it minimally affects the outcome. This is a valid complaint but not one that should earn the scorn and purposefully low ratings this game has received. As for the multiplayer, I found it to be entertaining but ultimately very repetitive with later difficulty levels being set a little too high. The baseball card pack way of upgrading your gear is good in that it keeps you coming back for more and prevents you from obtaining and maxing out the best guns too early. However I swear that they purposely coded it so that you don't receive upgrades to guns you actually use. This can lead to grinding and frustration as you attempt to get the one gun/upgrade that your pining for. Added to this frustration is the difficulty of the gold difficulty levels. Gold difficulty is set up so that it can only be beat in one of two ways. Method one: obtain 3 dedicated friends, you all level your characters to max level, and then you all obtain the maximum level in the best guns in the game. This will give you less than a 50% chance to beat gold. Method two: One person goes as a specific race of a specific class, you fight a specific enemy in a specific spot on a specific level, and you manipulate the game design based on the abilities of that one class. This will give you a 75% chance of beating gold. Since the first method requires the highest levels of the best guns you're pigeon-holed into doing the second method so many times you get burnt out until you don't want to play anymore. So a good first attempt at multiplayer but definitely needs work.",10,2012-04-03,XBOX 360,user
Notonlytheend,"This is a true disappointment. It would be easy to blame a generic deus ex rip off ending for my disappointment or day 1 DLC that was poorly handled. Or even the insulting ABC choices that lead to the same cut scenes. In reality, the problems come from a shift in design and goals of a company that once triumphed the greatest RPG's the world has ever seen. It's a problem of sacrificing what you're best at not for the sake of innovation, but for the sake of being more appealing. When this happens, the little things that make a game great get missed. For instance, Mass Effect moved from twelve squadmates to six (unless you bought the DLC so I'm not counting it). This was supposed to give greater conversation in the mission and lead to a more intense interaction. But that was not the case. Further, when you do re-encounter old squadmates, they don't even join you for a single mission. They may follow you around the citadel, but never do you get the full interaction; it feels rushed and forced. Another major loss is that of actual side missions. Where once I traveled to planets and few to the surface to retrieve key items, I now scan a planet while reaper chase me like the ghosts from Pac-man. There's no exploration. Multiplayer was obviously tacked on to prevent us from selling the game back. But most insulting of all is the fact that Bioware lied. Straight up, unmistakably lied. They promised no ABC ending and that's what they gave us. They promised complete resolution and they left thing purposefully cryptic. It's not the fact that they did these things; it's that they lied. ""There are many different endings. We wouldnâ",4,2012-04-03,XBOX 360,user

I was sorry to lose one particular person earlier on in my play thru but it's about hard choices in war isn't it? So the game, it's nearly as good as ME2, there are way more weapon options which I liked tho. I tended to stick with the modded geth assault rifle tho the Chakram thrower from playing the koatr demo was also cool. So it was an epic run thru, my 6 year old son was invested in it too, he thought he was watching a movie, I have to drop some kudos on the multiplayer too, the first 2 weeks or so with the game I spent on that as it's very well executed and very enjoyable, check it out if you haven't.

Allthegoodones,"So I had been following all the hype around this game prior to its release and had bought into it all because, and I'm certain even the disappointed will agree, this was by far the most engaging video game ever made. Even ME 3 was an amazing experience, the whole quarian vs geth storyline and the conclusion of it was easily the most powerful sub plot in a game i've ever experienced. The ending though... what a grumble inducing affair it was! It was clearly rushed... even if this had been a single game that ending would not have sufficed. Bur for a trilogy, its down right criminal to end with a five minute cut scene. There had to have been a fully playable epilogue chapter. Shepard's death in itself wasn't the disappointment it was more the callousness with which this legend we had been building for years was abandoned is what broke all the hearts. Shepard dying is a fitting option for sure, adding invaluably to the replayability of the whole series. But bioware seriously needed to take a leaf from the RDR book wherein the protag dies in the penultimate chapter allowing for closure for the ones left behind. Ofcourse for those players who managed to make the decision throughout the series to keep Shepard alive in the end would be awarded with shepard as the Protag of the final/epilogue chapter as well. Alas, Bioware has dropped the ball on that opportunity and even if they come out with a DLC fixing this problem it will not hold the same value or meaning. Having said that, the game itself is remarkable and kudos to Bioware for undertaking this mystifying journey and bringing us along for the ride. In all honesty the plotline of the ME series has never been as strong as the subplots and relationships and feeling of camaraderie that the game was able to bring to players and as far as those attributes are concerned, let me just say that even though i sided with the geth initially, the very next day, after a sleepless night haunted by visions of Tali's heartbreaking death, i simply had to go back and kill the geth of instead. And its not just Tali... Garruss, and Liara... Mordin and Wrex... Ashley and Miranda and joker and Kelly and even EDI... these were more than just team mates, they were real friends who my shepard cared about and who cared about him. No one has ever been able to do that before, it is a feeling exclusive to the ME series and a feeling that i will crave to feel again until someone take the ME formula and improves on it to deliver a the masterpiece this game was until they botched up the climax. All in all, it was one hell of an experience and it would have been all that much better had Bioware given the time and effort to the ending that this game deserved. Even so i'm grateful for the effort they did put in. Now they need to work on a new ME series, one set in the aftermath of this one.

The gameplay, visuals, soundtrack, etc. are all top notch. Bioware didn't deviate much from ME2, but they sure did put on an excellent display for the fans. I think the majority of people that have issues with the ending are just not getting the big picture. ""Disowning"" Bioware... one of the funniest things I've seen or heard in my entire life. Nonsense. Move on! It's a video game, a form of leisure time activity, entertainment, a form of art, it's not a law or a living thing or a crisis. If I had a dollar for every time I was ""disappointed"" about a form of entertainment and I carried on the way the ""cause"" did, I'd be filthy rich. This isn't the first time people were disappointed and it certainly won't be the last. All you have to do is abstain from gaming and we'll all be better off.

The biggest problem is the nonsensical, plot hole ridden, open to speculation ""endings"" which is really one cutscene which uses 95% of the same assets and different colored explosions. In addition Bioware used various shortcuts which really hurt the game in the end. The side quest missions weren't really missions at all, more like a find a needle in a haystack type of game. There is no quest tracking, and tali's face was google photoshopped in. The cutting of corners wouldn't have diminished the rating so much as the fact that the ending negates the point of the entire series ""player choice.""

And really, if you look around, that's all people are complaining about is that last 5-10 minutes. Even if you hated those last moments, to say that those final minutes completely ruin either the game or the entire series is just ludicrous. If you skip it because of that, you're missing out.

Also you are presented with many less choices than before, you know just get the good / evil choice and both lead to the same result. Seeing as this game was always about narrative, the story seems to have thinned out ten fold with the most important aspect of the game now seemingly being the shooter, i never played mass effect to kill hordes of the enemy, that always bored the hell out of me, but that is all this game throws at you, I found that i would often change from hardcore to casual just because of the length of time it was taking to fight the hordes, i wanted a well writen story not a shooter. If i had wanted to aimlessly kill hordes of enemy i would have played dead island or some other shooter. Now the ending ruined the previous 2 games for me i feel like it makes everything a bit pointless and futile because realisticlly you had no chance of changing anything meaning all of your previous decisions are void as such.

Many Metacritic users have written fantastic ME3 negative reviews, so I'm not going to elaborate on those. I recommend traveler's review dated March 29, 2012; it's one of the best examples I've seen.

Huey_Freeman,"'m not a big fan of Mass Effect 3's ending. I thought it was convoluted and anticlimactic for anticlimatic's sake. Though a lot of about the ending actually does work. I loved the fade out while I was rushing down to the last destroyer with my brother's in arms. I loved the fade in to Shephard badly injured and slowly walking towards her/his destiny awaiting him/her deep inside of The Citadel. I loved Anderson and Shepard communicating for opposite ends of The Citadel discussing what was going on. The long walk way up into The Illusive Man's secret hideout. It was all very atmospheric and epic and kind of beautiful. I thought the paragon/rendegade prompts were good as well during the ""standoff"". And I actually liked the twist that the little boy was The Catalyst. But the 3 choices he gives you were indeed pretty lame. And the lack of exposition following said decision was just plain bad. You can't end a game that encompasses over 140 hours of gameplay and millions of decisions made by the player with just 3 crew members walking off of the Normandy and just cut to the credits....EVEN IF you're planning on releasing DLC. There is a lot of room for criticism for that horrible decision made by whoever at Bioware that made it. I can't believe that ending got all the way to the final product. Its actually kind of sad. But, it DID NOT ruin the game or the series for me. Because it wasn't the fact that Shephard was destined to die (or **** still don't know do we) that actually is kind of good when you think about it. Its life. Sometimes no matter what decisions you make you can't fight your fate and what is going to be is just going to be. Your destiny is something you must embrace. Which is why I chose the middle option and made Shephard sacrifice herself. Yes, HERSELF. Female Shephard is a MILLION TIMES better than male Shephard and I'm a dude. From the voice acting (Jennifer Hale is amazing and the guy voices male Shepard is very boring) to character design she is just so much more fun to play with. Seriously if you haven't played the games thru with Fem Shep you are doing yourself a HUGE disservice as I have found the game way better controlling her. But back to 3, the game is incredible. There are so many jaw-dropping moments and sheer brilliance (if you haven't played thru with the From Ashes DLC you are missing out on what I find to be the best addiction to the game - Javik and his story). The improvements in shooting and offensive strategy are borderline limitless. And I had a remarkable experience playing the game. To think someone can really give this game a 0-5 based off the ENDING ALONE is proposterous. Are you guys really even Mass Effect fans? Or narcissists?",10,2012-03-29,XBOX 360,user
GibsonJunkie,"I've really enjoyed this game. The graphics look great. I was able to import my save files from ME1 and 2. The combat is upgraded, and feels even smoother than in the second. The ending, which most people have a problem with, I actually really liked. I felt like as the game moved along, loose ends were being tied together while the plot still advanced, and characters met their end (or not!) based purely on my actions. Honestly, my main complaint is being forced to run around with my gun out nearly the entire time, and some occasional issues during combat when I was unable to take cover for some unknown reason. Overall, I'll give this game a 9/10, for a few technical bugs, but an overwhelmingly intriguing plot, and a high replay value. Thanks for reading!",9,2012-03-29,XBOX 360,user

traveler,"Let me preface this by saying that I was a long time fan of the series and of Bioware games in general; I played both ME1 and ME2 dozens of times over the years (no exaggeration!), and KOTOR until my eyes bled (ok, slight exaggeration; but not by much). So it really does pain me to give this game such a low score. The short of it is: the game is rushed and incomplete. Corners were obviously cut all about, and it shows. Most notably in the classical RPG elements of story and exploration. The long of it: in ME3 what you see is that Bioware/EA are quite obviously trying to appeal to the massive consumer base that loves shooter games. Great (and in a sense so was ME1). But the results are that a great deal of time seemed to have been spent copying shooter elements from other games, in an effort to create a fairly mediocre corridor shooter experience, with wonky controls. The glaring thing is what is gone with all this effort. Exploration. Astounding that a game that markets itself as as RPG has so little of it. There are limited hubs, much smaller than those in the previous installments, that provide little interaction for engaging with the world. NPC interaction is either highly scripted, as in, no the player doesn't choose what to say; or it just is a matter of eavesdropping on two people talking in order to get a quest that actually doesn't contain any gaming elements other than go here on the map and press a button. Old RPG standards like equipment and journal logs are streamlined to the point of being non-existent (the journal in particular is totally inept and incomplete; it doesn't update or provide you useful information on the quests - a real step down from the previous games). Why? Well, because the game appears to be trying to force you into a linear narrative. In other words, the whole 'choose your own adventure' motif of the brand has taken a backseat for brief corridor shooting experiences punctuated by lengthy cut scenes with limited interaction. Think Gears of War, only worse (and that is saying something!). The plan to do this is so blatant that the game actually has options to switch it from an RPG to a straight story-shooter, right there on its opening screen. What is most glaring in this rushed and incomplete experience is the real drop in story telling. Now it is no secret that Bioware was purchased by EA, and that some fans were concerned about how that would effect the culture of the company. But it also is no secret that the people writing this game are not the same ones who wrote the first. And it shows. Lore is forgotten, conversations seem forced, character development can be childish, etc. Its like they inherited a world to write and imagine in that they either didn't understand, or didn't care about. I'm not sure which is worse. And don't get me started on that ending.... OK, DO get me started on that ending. It's here that the evidence of how quickly and with such little care the game was cobbled together is most glaring. Some people have complained that the ending lacks choice (true), and closure (also true), or is confusing (not so much; somebody apparently copied Deus Ex). But the most repugnant aspects of the ending are just how lazy it is. Reused cut scenes, short, simplified conversation options. The whole thing smacks of 'rush it out the door, we have a deadline!' And back to the writers not being the same crop or the same caliber, the ending also doesn't seem to be connected with the rest of the series either in ideas or themes. You remember 'dark energy'? You know, the raison d'etre for Tali's presence on Haestrom, as well as mentioned at other parts of ME2 (like Illium). There was this whole big setup for 'dark energy' throughout ME2, it was foreshadowed as being of some galactic importance. And in ME3. Nada. Nothing. Zilch. The storyline was just abandoned and forgotten. Oops. No dark energy concerns here. This smacks of just lazy writing, and inept plotting. (Rumor has it that this was originally to be a part of the buildup for the conclusion - a connection between the middle act of the trilogy and its finale. But was abandoned for.... who knows. Instead you get a series of rushed deus ex machina developments. And then, over.) It pains me as a longtime fan and customer of bioware to see how little regard they have for quality here. That was the brand really, immersive RPGs with engaging, high adventure stories. That apparently is not the brand anymore. I don't know what is. Finally, I think I should point out the discrepancy between the 'professional critics' and 'user reviews' here and elsewhere. This is amazing. The reasons for the discrepancy are unclear, but I think the ramifications are going to be long reaching. The central question (for me at least) is one of trust: Is there any spirit of consumer protection left in software review or is it just caveat emptor, and have a nice day?",1,2012-03-29,XBOX 360,user
Weremutt,"I have severally mixed feelings about this game. ME1 was one of the best games I have ever played to date with all of the different options that a character has. Granted the cover and combat system was not too good, but the story was incredible and gripping. Once I finished the game I would always start another character to play with. ME1 was not perfect by any means, but it was still an incredible game. I have gone back an played ME1 again since ME3 came out and I still enjoyed it more. I liked the writing a lot more and how the story pulled you in. ME2 did away with a lot of things but still allowed for a lot of conversation/story telling/ and choices that a character could make. The combat was improved, weapons and armor were stripped out. But the game was still good. The story line was still grabbing but not nearly as much as ME1. It was highly character driven through your squad. The enemy and allied AI was greatly improved over ME1. I did not like the auto dialogue that took place with Zaeed or Kasumi. I felt it was a cope-out by the developers. ME3 did one thing right that the other games did not have nearly as well and that was combat. I felt that the combat in the game was just about flawless. I could not have asked for more in the combat department. The inventory was a great improvement. The game really lets a person customize how they want Shepard and their squad to play. I felt that allied AI was much worse in ME3 then ME2 and was on level of ME1. Most of the time I found my squad doing nothing except ducking for cover or standing out in the open in the middle of a fire fight. Enemy AI was improved but for some reason on the hardcore difficulty which is what I always play on, I felt the game was way too easy. I died twice on my first play through. In the other 2 games I died much more then that on hardcore. I felt the game was way to easy and it could have been more difficult. I still enjoyed playing the game but not nearly as much as I did the other two. The conversation choices were just not there. The majority of them only gave you two options and barely anything to ask. Your decisions from the first two games were almost non-existent. The majority of your squad from the second game was reduced to cameo roles which is just wrong. They all should have gotten a mission were you went into combat with them again. They should have all been there at the final mission as a major task force. While the writing was greatly improved upon from the other two games in terms of delivery of lines, there was not enough selectable conversation between squad members. The majority of your conversations came from EDI, Vega, Javik (if you had bought a collectors edition or the DLC). Honestly they should have brought back the elevator scenes for the squad banter. I never disliked them. I actually enjoyed them. It was something different and new and there was barely ever any loading screens. You had something to listen too while the game loaded. There was way too much auto-dialogue and I felt that it pulled away from the game. The character import for the third game is horribly broken and i hope they fix it soon. Only one of my characters imported over correctly. Thankfully Bioware has stated they are working on a fix and it is on the testing phase. The game has a lot of glitches and I feel that it was actually rushed. I wish they could have spent more time on it. For those that have completed the game they know that there is only one true ending with a true resolution which is kind of wrong. I will not get into it but lets just say that Shepard has spent too much time around the Reapers and Reaper artifacts. I did like the way the game ended, I am not always a fan of happy endings and I knew this trilogy was not going to have one. War never has a happy outcome. Mass Effect 1 was easily a 10/10 for me even with the broken combat/inventory system. Mass Effect 2 was a 9/10. The removal of inventory and the addition of ammo made the game not nearly as good. I give ME3 a 7/10 because of all of the negative features which I have listed for the game. While the game was fun to play, I never played Mass Effect for the combat. If I wanted to play a game for combat I would play some battlefield or gears of war. There was simply just too much wrong with it for me. It took too much away from the experience and immersion factor of the trilogy. I now know why so many people have left Bioware since the game went gold. They knew the game was not up too par and had a lot of flaws. They do not want to be associated with a substandard product again. I would not pay full retail of $59.99 for this game. It is honestly not worth it. I would wait for the $39.99 price drop. I thought Skyrim was a better game then this and that game has a lot of problems and it is not even a style of game that I like too much.

WintersLMJ,"Despite the ending, BIOWARE put together another game that I fully engrossed myself in for two straight days. This game may not have had any new graphics, but it came with a plethora of weapons and gear which the Mass Effect 2 lacked. This game meshed ME1 and ME2 perfectly and the decisions felt as real as ever. The one blemish to this amazing game of course us the ending. As a true fan of anything BIOWARE, I can truly say that this is not enough to ruin a perfect score especially with the company re-writing the ending. It is TBD whether or not they will force you to pay money for said ""DLC"". But if i were BIOWARE, given the absolutely terrible feedback from FANS, i would think they would not charge. BUT EA is the overall leader and has the finals say in that matter. EA has had a bad history of being untrue to their fans. We'll see folks. Although the ending of ME2 is much more memorable, this game ended how it should have and will now have an even better ending with more closure. I think we can all thank BIOWARE for giving us such a great trilogy to remember (and still be playing over and over and again) for years to come. So, fans of the trilogy and BIOWARE, stop with the bad reviews, the game was glorious and the games will always be the best storyline I have ever experienced.

PopeDizzle,Everything you have come to enjoy and expect from mass effect. The gameplay is improved and the places you go feel alive. Multiplayer is a nice tack on fun to play with friends bad is its a pick up group. The game as a whole is fantastic...until it ends. I'm not going to down my score based on that alone but I will let be known that I hope Bioware does follow through and give their loyal fan base the ending they deserve. It's not a band wagon thing or trying to ruin their artistic integrity because I do believe games have become a form of art. I believe it is their right to tell their story the way they want. But a story is not a story without the final act. Bioware has done something amazing that no other game has done to date. Made a series when the player is so engaged and involved in a game that it has become the players story. That in itself is an accomplishment and it shows with the player backlash with the ending we were provided. So I recommend this game and the entire series to anyone. I have high hopes that Bioware will prove they are as loyal to their fans as their fans are to them and the Mass Effect universe.,9,2012-03-28,XBOX 360,user
Xenugears,"This game is simultaneously overrated and underrated. Overrated because critics and fanboys blindly gave the game a pass without addressing its glaring, near deal-breaking faults such as a curious lack of choice, wonky dialogue, a cumbersome cover system, vague journal entries, Jessica Chobot, James Vega, an inexcusable glitch not allowing me to import my Shepard from ME1 and 2 (really, Bioware?) and the now infamous ending. However, I would argue that ME3 is also slightly underrated because, well, the game STILL has solid combat, fun weapons (I love the Scorpion, a heavy pistol that shoots out sticky proximity mines), great music and a some genuinely rich emotional moments that strike a chord. The game's horrible conclusion and inability (or unwillingness) to weave ""my Shepard's"" actions from ME1 and 2 may not enough to ""ruin"" the game/series entirely and, for that matter, retroactively (a la Matrix Revolutions) but it's certainly enough to elicit a sense of regret over what could have been the best science fiction story of this current console generation (Portal 2 is safe!).

This game is a continuation and culmination of the story of Mass Effect 1 and 2, which has remained consistent and well told from the very first moments of ME1. All the ending requires of the player is that you as a player engage a little bit of your own depth and intellectual curiosity. If you are unable to engage those qualities, than you have bigger problems than being dissatisfied with the ending of the greatest space saga of the last 30 years. There are some minor flaws in my mind; forcing the player into ""multiplayer"", you really have to. And also some of the 'enhanced' cover mechanics are buggy, and don't work as they should.

Sure the story doesn't seem as in depth as the other two games, the decisions don't feel as though they mean as much but this is the last ride for Shepard. The decisions you make in this game must effect the game instantly as you are building up the forces to defeat the Reapers, not be sure to effect your character 3 games from now. Overall the music, pacing, graphics (little buggy) and game play are great. Add in the ability to mod your weapons again and this game has some great value to it. It may not be the end all to video games, but it is far from the lowest of the low scores some have given it.

BM7,"The game is a development of the previous chapter (less revolutionary than the jump between the first and second chapter) but which confirms how much good there was in the previous gameplay with several improvements. All the missions (not only the main ones) contribute to enriching the story. All the strengths of the previous chapters are confirmed: the protagonist's choices are more important than in the past, the relationship with his companions is developed even better, the settings are extraordinary, the choices of the past have repercussions, the story rises during its development with twists and with an ever greater growth. The finale is the great conclusion of a masterpiece for its story and the bond that is established with all the characters involved throughout the entire trilogy.",10,2025-03-06,XBOX 360,user

joshjmilli,"Sure, ME3 definitely has shortcomings. The sidelining of certain crew members can be distasteful to some, and the ending itself was quite shallow for such a deeply complex narrative with a whole host of potential variables individual to each playthrough. Yet, I personally cannot bring myself to let that massively detract from an otherwise fantastic game. The story up until the climax is enthralling. The character dynamics, cinematography and writing are arguably the best in the series. The gameplay combines elements from the first 2 games to create a satisfyingly air tight cover shooter that allows for multiple play styles. And I’ll also give a honourable mention to the sound design; The Reapers just sound exceptional! In 2024, I’d be dishonest to myself if I gave this game anything lower than an 8 as a complete package with all the DLC. On the other hand, it’s an entirely different story if you’re playing without the DLC; It’s a much different, much inferior game at that point. Theres so much here that makes it far from mediocre. It’s simply another fantastic Mass Effect game that I think 100% deserves to stand on the pedestal with 1 and 2.",9,2024-12-02,XBOX 360,user

slugnutt,"I love the Mass Effect series. It's by far my favorite gaming series. Even though the RPG elements were neutered after the first game, I still love the following entries. What really, really got to me was the ending of Mass Effect 3. Specifically, it's 20 minutes or so. It's not that it boiled down to choose your own ending 1, 2, 3, 4, (red, blue, green, shoot the space kid), it's that it was absolutely awful in my opinion. The free extended ending DLC missed the point entirely. I didn't need an explanation orthem to expand on the meaning of each ending. To me, it was obvious without the extended ending DLC. I needed a great ending to an amazing series of games. I don't feel like there needed to be 100 different endings depending on the choices you made along the way. 1 amazing ending could have been enough for me. 3 or 4 different amazing endings, even better. Easy for me to say, I know. But 4 trashy throw-away endings in a game so rich with story & lore. Maybe I'm being dramatic, but at the time, it was heartbreaking. And in the moment, it nearly ruined the series for me. A long time ago, I just compartmentalized the whole thing. There is Mass Effect 1, 2 & 3 over here in this box, & the last 20 minutes over here in this box. However, to me, it's still a stain on an otherwise amazing series. A skid mark on the tidy-whities of gaming. In my opinion.",5,2024-05-21,XBOX 360,user

When a game has such a terrible cut scenes it is always an indication that it is a bad game. Made worse when they are unskipable as that show that the devs only wanted to create false playtime and waste people's time. ( to be fair, many games were made that way, and not to be repayable and infinite fun, that is because they are empty) Review from ME1 I played 3 hours then switched to Mass effect 3, to see if anything good can actually be learned from how bad the 1 started. To not waste my time. Perfect, as it did save me time, which I uninstalled before playing ( after choosing "" jump into action"") i had a 15 min cut scene without gameplay.

Not to say ilk of the rest of the game, but when you compare the beginning, middle, and end, the middle is by and large the best part of the game. This makes for a strong disconnect when it comes to talking about ME3, and really where the key problem lies in it. Everything about the middle of the game is fantastic! The continued character and world building, the established character dynamics, the choices you make from previous games effecting outcomes in this game, and really just everything working together till the finale. It really says a lot when the discourse of the end is the biggest thing people remember about the series, and while I keep trying to think of strong moments in the game I keep thinking back to how the ending was.

phoenix_prjct,"Final Thoughts: Mass Effect 3 eclipses its predecessors with epic story beats that converge the biggest conflicts bubbling throughout the series into emotional rollercoasters. Characters shine with crackling chemistry and random conversations provide smooth development and excellent pacing between big moments. Gameplay is further refined, keeping what works and ironing out the kinks for an action-focused adventure, an adventure amplified by gorgeous visuals and a tone-setting soundtrack. It’s sad, however, that from a beginning that sets a galactic apocalypse with such fantastic force and characters that can more than handle the weight on their backs, the ending feels like a completely different team of writers took control…writers that had absolutely no experience with the series. Rendering every choice the player has made moot and betraying even its core story, Mass Effect 3 ends on a bitter, unsatisfying note to what’s largely been one of the best sci-fi RPGs to hit gaming.

Filmanwalt,"The commander's journey ends. Shepard has accompanied me for a long time and again and again. With part 3, the trilogy comes to a worthy end for me! story The reaper threat has arrived, after you could still prevent entry in the Arrival DLC in Mass Effect 2, the galaxy-wide threat has now arrived. And this feeling of doom runs through the entire game, it puts you in a position to make every possible effort to take down the Reaper. This very action-packed and warlike scenario is staged by breathtakingly good missions. It's about the solution of ancient conflicts, the alliance of the individual species ... the creation of a common armed force to prevent the destruction by the Reaper. Bioware has told a very exciting story, which in the end leads to a door 1, 2 or 3 decision, but personally I am compliant with the selectable outcomes. Only the representation, albeit understandable, of the last part of the anti-reaper weapon takes a lot of getting used to (catalyst). Once again, very strong dialogues are created that really take your breath away (Tali and Legion, Liara, Javik DLC, etc.). The bond with the characters is only strengthened and you just have the feeling of fighting for something together. Gameplay The best gameplay in the trilogy. Very strong combo game play, many different skills and occasional skill options. A lot of weapons, mods and upgrades as well as some armor are fun for every tinkerer. It could have been deeper, but that was enough for me. The shooting around of biotic abilities combined with the very well-functioning squad game play is always new fun. There are also a lot of missions, although unfortunately a few of the side missions are limited to pure scanning. Here I would have liked more staging. The constant growth of the war assets makes it clear again in which position the galaxy is and must be in order to exist. graphic Atmospherically, musically, and staged simply breathtakingly. The many cut scenes in the last mission alone still give you massive goosebumps. Conclusion It is very important to play DLC again. The Citadel DLC in particular is one of the best DLC that has ever existed. But Leviathan is also very instructive.

SuperkenGaming,"Mass Effect 3 Legendary Edition Go google pictures of Mirandas butt Mass Effect 3 is the final chapter of Sheards story youre off to end the reapers, this race of beings that threaten the existence of the universe as you know it… I didn’t play the original version, but here in Mass Effect 3 you have the option to play RPG style or action style… as someone that played the last 2 games I love the choice aspect of this series so I chose to mainline the story with the rpg elements here.. choosing my dialog.. unfortunately though the game doesn’t make it hard for you to just b line to the end in about 12 hours. Why? Because this just ist the least interesting game in the trilogy.. it just is.. you already know which charcters you like in this universe.. and there aren’t really anymore to fall in love with before the big showfdown.. so I just didn’t care to do the side missions, especially with just how repetitive the main campaign felt.. why would i? I had no insentive to explore and go do more.. that being said mass Efect 3 is decently enjoyable to play through.. You will get more squadmembers as the story goes on, youll be picking out their special abilities, and they do become an important part of your arsenal.. for example Liara was a stple for me to deal with annoying shielded enemies, I loved how on command I could have her just throw any enmy in the eir right in front of me.. so it really is up to you to baance your squad of 3 to your play style.. I do wish however there was more information given to me before a mission s maybe I was more throughful about the 2nd member… if I ever had anyone different it was mostly because the tory forced it on me.. in general mass effect 3 does an awful job at pre gaming… you have to chose your loadout before you go in.. having no idea what youll be dealing with ahead of time.. it makes literally 0 sense for me to not change my loadout based on my current situation on the fly… it ultimately lead to me not relly trying out any guns after I had one I was pretty satisfied… If mass Effect 3 werent the bow ontop of a series I had to see the end of after a huge investment into 1 and 2… I probably wouldn’t have been so invested to see it through.. it lies on the shoulders of the success of the perevious games and sadly doesn’t live up to the world building standards they set… While I did enjoy going through this campaign and putting an end to this intergalactic war… by itself, mass effect 3 isnt all that great.

The gameplay is the best in the trilogy and its soundtrack is brilliant. The ending may be a little underwhelming but the extended cut improves it massively and stops it from being bad. If anything the extended cut made the ending go from bad to somewhat decent. And then you have the DLC's with the citadel Dlc being the standout one and the others all being decent side stories. The citadel DLC was totally amazing and a great send off to the trilogy. The trilogy as a whole is probably my favourite video game of all time.

Second, the main plot at Mass Effect 3 turned out to be as good as in the first part. In 3 part we solve the most important problems of the universe, finish the stories of all important characters. We get answers to almost all questions (except dark energy, which was forgotten at all. Although there were a bunch of references to her in Mass Effect 2). I can even say that I liked the ending of Mass Effect 3. The final with Extended Cut isn 't that bad. Yes in 2012, not many would agree. Apparently, emotions took over.

drlowdon,"Continuing from the events of the previous game Mass Effect 3 opens with the Reapers attacking Earth and, having narrowly escaped with his life, Commander Shepard yet again finds himself as humanity's last hope for survival. Series veterans will be instantly familiar with the games concept in which a series of core and side missions can be accessed from the Normandy's galaxy map. This time around however it is not just a case of recruiting allies to your cause. Depending on how each mission is handled vital resources, such as fleets of warships, can be gained to aid in the final battle against the Reapers. As has always been the case many of these missions allows for a great deal of freedom with a number of, sometimes very difficult, choices being afforded to the player. The series strong combat remains virtually unchanged from the series second entry and still plays like a simplified version of Gears of War. Responding to audience criticisms a number of features have been tweaked however. While the popular Mako may not make a return the weapon and armour customisation has returned and the dull planet scanning all but removed. For the first time in the Mass Effect series multiplayer has also been included. To be honest it offers only a minor diversion from the main campaign with only one mode (imagine Horde mode from Gears of War or Halo) and six small maps to play in co-op with up to three other players. Since the playing multiplayer aids in preparing for the Reaper assault in the main game however it is worth investing some time in. And so to the much criticised ending to the game. In my personal opinion some of this criticism is justified as it certainly leaves several plot holes and very much jars with the philosophy of Mass Effect. A few fans have certainly gone overboard however as when you consider the huge influence you are able to wield throughout the game the disappointing final ten minutes in no way spoils the 20+ hours that come before or the epic series as a whole.",8,2020-03-25,XBOX 360,user

UNTIL, you get to the last 15 minutes of ME3. I can’t comprehend how the same team that made these great games decided that this was the way to end it, nodded to each other, and said it was good to go. It still baffles me. It’s probably not the worst video game ending of all time; but it’s certainly the worst video game ending of all time for a game that was actually good. Nobody who loves these games, this lore, this universe of gaming will ever get over it. When I did my last replay I stopped before the final mission, I refused to play the ending. But still, this is an incredible game, you just have to ignore the last 15 minutes and pretend something else happened inside your brain.

RafaelBarrera,"Mass Effect 3 is a villyfied game just because of one thing: its ending. I think it is a bit unfair to the game, the ending can't destroy the whole game experience even tho it was the close up to the whole saga ( which is why it is so hatred ). If we don't take into account the ending, this game is an improvement of what we saw in Mass Effect 2: combat system, space mining, graphics, variety in weapons, etc... The game could perfectly be a 10/10 , but as I said: the ending is horrible. It's just so mad but at the same time appreciable because of the risk the developers took ( it went wrong, obviously ), maybe it was an original idea, maybe they didn't know how to finish the saga, anyway, it's a really good game with non deserved ending.

crusher351,"To start off, I'm going to mention something that has been said a hundred times before; the ending was weak. For all of the effort and time that I (and many others) have put into this trilogy, the ending should and could have been 100% better. However, during my current play through of the game and its DLC's, I realized something; despite having a mediocre ending, this is one of the greatest experiences in gaming. I have to say that this game had a lot of good improvements over the last two. The ability to have a serious melee attack was nice as was the ability to jump over gaps. The amount of weapons to choose from was also a nice bonus, and the customization of said weapons just added to it. The combat is improved slightly over the last game, and feels smoother and faster. The characters are back and look better than ever. Honestly, this game still holds on a graphics front today. One of the features from the last game that I'm glad they got rid of is the scanning of planets for resources. Yes, you still have to scan, but you don't have to go to each planet one at a time. Instead you scan while flying the Normandy, and if something comes up, then you go to the planet and scan it. This, despite the ending, is one of the greatest stories of all time, and just proves how good Bioware used to be.",8,2018-09-04,XBOX 360,user
Twigball,Like most people I thought this game was just brilliant apart from the terrible ending from which we deserved better after playing all 3 games. But It still deserves a 10 because of the sheer scale and the amount of enjoyable hours I've sunk playing it.,10,2018-07-01,XBOX 360,user
SGOrion,"I just finished playing all of the Mass Effect games. The first time, I let the council die, destroyed the collector base, romanced Tali, miss all of ME3 DLC, and chose the synthesis ending. This time I saved the council, kept the collector base, romanced Ashley, and chose the destroy ending. I actually don't dislike the ending as much as a lot of these reviews do. I understand why people did not like the way it ended with three choices, but it actually makes more sense than they think. One thing life has taught us, is that you can make all the right choices, and still not have control of a certain situation. The reviews here make the mistake of assuming humanity should have 100% control over their fate because they made the right choices. While the choices they made did have consequences, such as being able to save both the geth and quarians, cure the genophage, etc, we must realize that we were never in complete control over the fate galaxy. Meeting the construct, TIM, it is he that has complete control. He is the catalyst, he has made sure the cycle has continued for millions of years, and only through his decision can it be broken. A threat that is as powerful and ever lasting as this one, is not going to be ended without some hard choices. I thought it was extremely fitting that the cycle was ended through the one who started it. The choices we made allowed us to get this far, and we must choose between the three ways that TIM believes will end the cycle. I found the emotional pieces very moving, and I thought they did a great job of wrapping up the personal endings for each character. The only thing I wish, is that after you get the ending that Shepard is alive, that there is more than just him breathing within the rubble. Mass Effect still remains my favorite games series of all time up to this point.",9,2018-03-23,XBOX 360,user

The fact that the clunky but sincere sci-fi of the original is unashamedly traded in for a full-blown action game is not what breaks the game. As I said the gameplay is fun, but the story... the story is just dogsh#t. I'm sorry, but it's true. I still enjoy the first 2/3rds of the game to a certain extent, but by the finale Mass Effect 3 completely crashes and burns and its clear that the writers had no idea what they were doing.",6,2017-12-03,XBOX 360,user
MarsCorialanus,"For me this game was a major betrayal. I loved Mass effect 1, even its issues had a certain charm to them. Mass effect 2 was more polished and created a much larger universe to be in. Both had amazing characters, cool ideas, and had me thinking ME would be the next Star Trek type of scifi. The world felt like somewhere you could really hang out. And it had challenging ideas about humanity and diversity and extremism. Mass Effect 3 was awful... it was dumbed down, the story felt U.S Ra Ra, and overall it spat in the face of its previous fans by giving them a really terrible pay off. What should have been an epic climax was instead a wet fart. Its not just the ending that **** by the way, the whole campaign was poorly constructed. It felt like a whole other series. It was more like Gears of War than the Mass Effect RPG I had come to love. I like to pretend that there never was a third game so that it doesn't taint the other two.",0,2017-10-27,XBOX 360,user

Shame on you EA and shame on you Bioware for selling your soul. And yes... the end still makes no sense. I love the Mass Effect Trilogy. It is the best stuff Bioware has created in the last 13 years. The Universe and Lore is so good, they could really establish it for a long time and make it a real sci-fi classic. Mass Effect 3 is a very good game on it's own.

Epik_Ninnja,"The culmination of the incredible sci-fi epic, Mass Effect 3 takes place a year or so after the second game. The Reapers have arrived and it’s your job to unite the military forces of the galaxy to fight them (and to help save Earth). The fate of entire species depend upon the decisions you make. Combat has been refined again to include heavy melees, combat rolls, etc. and the power upgrading system is better than ever. This is also the first Mass Effect to include any multiplayer mode. Sure, the ending was a letdown but that doesn’t ruin the whole game by any means. You can appreciate this game for its customization options and combat without playing 1 and 2, but in the scheme of the trilogy, as the epic finale to this large-scale interactive story that shows you how important characters throughout the series end up, which can vary drastically depending on your actions, it becomes something truly great. I'll admit the ending was pretty lackluster, the multiplayer pales in comparison to the single player, and there are less decisions in the dialogue this time around. These flaws do not warrant all of the low-scoring reviews. I honeslty enjoyed this game more than the second game (but just barely). I'd say it's a 9.3 (whereas 2 would be a 9.2, in my opinion). Upon playing it in 2013, it was my favorite game and still might be.",9,2015-05-22,XBOX 360,user

Tomn8er,"People who give this game a low score must be impossible to please because this is one of the best games ever made. The story, the characters, the gameplay, the graphics, the soundtrack, the replayability, this game has it all. If you liked ME2 you should love this game. It takes everything that was good about that and builds on it. The story really raises the stakes. Instead of assembling a small crew to take out a Collector base, you're assembling entire species to take on the Reapers at large. The combat has been improved and is easily the best in the series. Gone are the tedious planet scanning from ME2 and Mako-roving from ME1. The presentation, which was already stellar in ME2, is even more impressive here, with incredible cutscenes and artistic environmental backdrops that will make you say just stare and say wow as you take in the scenery. It even adds multiplayer in the form of one of the best cooperative horde modes I've ever played. Amazingly, it even stacks up well against designated FPS games like Halo Reach's firefight mode. The one thing people seem to gripe about endlessly is the ending. Having come late to the party and hearing about the general backlash, I was bracing myself for the worst... and it never came. The ending might leave you scratching your head a bit and wanting more, but it's hardly the series-ruining catastrophe many people make it out to be. The worst I can say about it is that it does feel a little rushed, it lacks some closure and perhaps there weren't enough choices. So while it is slightly unsatisfying, it hardly ruins an otherwise near-perfect game. Even the DLC in this game is well worth the money IMO. If I was to rate all the Mass Effect games overall I'd give the first an 8, the second a 9 and this one a 10. I would place the Mass Effect firmly in the top series of the past console generation along with the Elder Scrolls, Halo, and Arkham games.

Flawless gameplay, a galaxy-spanning storyline, gripping characters, and a game that leaves you wishing that it would never end. Whether you're blasting your way through alien hordes to rescue old friends or watching helplessly as you tell a character that her husband died fighting the reapers, it's impossible to escape the brutality of this universe falling apart before your very eyes. I've beaten ME3 six times, and there's barely any crack in my enjoyment on successive playthroughs. Call me a fanboy, but I loved this game and the trilogy.

GrumpySteve,"This is easily the poorest offering Bioware has given us in many a year, and by far the worst of the Mass Effect trilogy. The original, ME1, was one of my all-time favorite CRPGs. I didn't like a lot of the changes they made to ME2 so much, because they made it more like a FPS and less like a CRPG, but I was able to tolerate the changes because the story was still pretty good. Mass Effect 3 unfortunately retains and even furthers the FPS feel of the game, eroding what little RPG element is left, and doesn't even make up for this with story this time -- the story is terrible. Probably the #1 issue I have with ME3 is that, far more than the others, it felt like a game on rails. There were very few options, very few choices, and almost no cases where the ""choices"" they gave you felt like they made any difference. Gone are any real stories relating to your crew-mates. There are none of those. It seems totally random which past crew mates Bioware gives you back again and which ones refuse to re-join you. There are hardly any conversations on the ship with your crew-mates any more, and no chance to do things like learn about them or earn any loyalty. The crew stories are basically gone, and replaced by nothing -- there are no other story elements in their stead. Another problem, at least on the Xbox, is the menu system, which is absolutely horrid. For some unfathomable reason, Bioware combined the Journal and the Codex, which is absolutely infuriating - it glows with ""new entries"" even when they are only just codex entries and not new quests. The side and main quests share the same menu now, which makes for an almighty mess, and there is no ""completed"" mission menu so by the end of the game you have this list that is like 80 items tall, and the UI always puts you in the middle of it, buried in the ""completed"" missions, forcing you to scroll up 20 or 3 items to get to the active quests. And then there is the issue that they tell you what planet something is on but NOT the system or the cluster, and they don't mark most quests on the galaxy map, so you have to randomly hop around from sector to sector trying to find quest locations. This is really stupid, as the girl assisting you even says she has marked stuff on your galaxy map (but she just hasn't). This feels like Bioware were just being jerks trying to make my life harder than it needed to be. Finally, I will rant a little bit about the ending. If you've heard anything about it, you've probably heard the rumor that the ending is horrible. All I can say about this is - the haters are UNDER-selling it. The ending is absolutely terrible. I'm not sure who at Bioware thought they should end their epic trilogy with a Morton's Fork type of dilemma, but I found it very forced and very unsatisfying. Also, the explanation for ""everything that has been happening in galactic history"" was really, REALLY lame. In the end, it felt like Bioware had a bunch of different ideas, wasn't sure which one would work, half-implemented all of them, and then slapped it together into a package and called it ""done."" There was too much mindless combat, and not enough interesting conversation options in this game. It's a poor successor to the first two MEs and does not deserve to share their name. The only good thing I can say is that the voice acting is still pretty good, and the basic way combat worked was enjoyable (although HIGHLY repetitive). The game is playable, but only as a shooter. Not for the story or RPG elements. Those things, which are normally Bioware strengths, were the major weaknesses of this game.",5,2014-12-15,XBOX 360,user
Rycr,"A good game with a disappointing ending. To be honest, I never really believed the hype about how every choice throughout the series would have a huge effect on the end result of the game, so in the end I wasn't really disappointed.

Marsonra,"Mass Effect 3. This is a game that I have heard non-stop controversy over. Most people say that this game has one of the worst endings to a video game ever. Some say that it is so bad, that it ruined the entire series. I don't believe this is true however. I played the first two Mass Effect games before I played this one, and I thought they were both absolutely fantastic games. Nothing will ever change my opinion on both of those games, not even if the series completely jumps the shark. As for this game, many of you are probably wondering my opinion on it. So, is this the fantastic conclusion to Commander Shepard's story we were all hoping for, or is the ending enough to ruin the entire series? Let's find out. The gameplay of this game is very much like the other two Mass Effect games that came before it. It is an action RPG that has third-person shooter elements. This game is every bit as fun as Mass Effect 1 and 2 before it. It also adds a few improvements this time around. For instance, the omni-tool can now be used as a blade for close range combat. While you probably won't find much use for it, seeing as how most enemies must be engaged from mid to long range, it can be useful for occasional stealth attacks and one-hit-kills. Also, the game's combat is now more of a mixture between Mass Effect 1 and Mass Effect 2. It definitely takes more elements from the latter rather than the former, but grenades are now back instead of grenade launchers. Medi-gel also now works in a similar way as it did in Mass Effect 1. It is now used to restore your health as well as your squad-mates'. The game is also pretty fun outside of combat. Outside of combat, you have to talk to people and aliens in order to go on more quests in the game. The dialogue wheel from the first two Mass Effects returns here, and it is every bit as good as it was in the first two games. The only real problem I have with this game's gameplay is that there are occasional bugs and glitches that I feel like they should have fixed before release. Some of the bugs are game-breaking, but they don't occur often enough to make them feel like a big problem. Despite occasional bugs, the gameplay is still every bit as good as it was in Mass Effect 1 and 2. If you enjoyed both of the previous two games for their tight gameplay, you'll feel right at home with this game. Anyone who didn't enjoy the gameplay will likely have to look elsewhere, as the gameplay hasn't evolved too much over Mass Effect 2, despite having a couple of additions to it. As for the graphics, this is one thing that this game definitely does better over both of its predecessors. The graphics now look sharper and more realistic than they ever did in the first two Mass Effect games. Everything in this game is very beautiful to look at, and worth experiencing for this reason alone. While it is not a huge improvement over Mass Effect 2, it is definitely an improvement. As for the story, this is the part that everyone seems to hate, all because of how it ends. I'm not going to spoil the ending here, however, I will say this: the ending really is not enough to ruin the entire game, or any of the other games in the franchise before it. Yes, the ending of this game could have been better, but hey, let's be honest, it also could have been a lot worse. The story of this game is still fantastic, despite having a not so great ending. The story continues on after the events of Mass Effect 2, showing that the Reapers have now invaded the Milky Way, and their first target is Earth. You will spend the rest of the game as Commander Shepard, getting together a squad, along with the entire galaxy to fight the Reaper threat. Many plot points from Mass Effect 2 reach their conclusion in this game. Also, Mass Effect 3 has the same good and evil decisions to make as in the first two games. Since this story is every bit as good as its predecessors, the ending aside, I don't think it's fair for people to hate this game simply because the ending was terrible. Overall, I love this game. Hate me all you want, but I think this game is the second best Mass Effect game. Mass Effect 2 is still better than this, but Mass Effect 3 is still better than Mass Effect 1. The ending to this game is really the only downside to it. Gameplay: 10/10 Graphics: 10/10 Story: 9/10 Overall: 10/10",10,2014-08-27,XBOX 360,user
HPSPhoenix,"The best game in the best franchise that has ever been, and likely will ever be. Although a lot of people seem to dislike the ending(s), with the Extended Cut they're fixed. They weren't as bad as you've been led to believe, anyway. This game has better combat, more great moments, better squadmates, (maybe) better DLC and, most importantly, the best story. That's not to say it's without its flaws - what isn't? There are a LOT more automated conversations in this game, as in, there are more conversations in which you can't make choices. However, the choices you do make in this game are probably the most morally challenging and best in the entire game. If I were to count down the trilogy's greatest moments, most would be from Mass Effect 3. I would advise buying all of the DLC. It may be pricey, but it's completely worth the money. From Ashes is probably the best, though.",10,2014-08-20,XBOX 360,user
Saqwana,i really like the game though i recognize its faults. my main complaint would the lack of different body types for Sheppard and the hands looking far older then they should with these characters. i also thin the should have been at least 12 companions in the game it would have added more variation. the lack of a solid sentinel can be an issue for some builds. the ending isn't great but i was fine with it before the extended cut. i think the extended cut adds more context to the ending which is nice. so overall it was a good solid game but not a great one.,8,2014-07-23,XBOX 360,user

HaloFever,"The ""Mass Effect"" series is the greatest trilogy of games in history, and the best games ever for the Xbox 360. The last entry, ""Mass Effect 3"", is the best of the three and a must play. Keep in mind that a majority of negative reviews are tied to the games ending, which only disappoints with respect to the series as a whole. ""Mass Effect 3"" shines in its convergence of story with gameplay. Some of the sequences are a little too ""Call of Duty"", with the cover mechanic too often negated by the liberal use of grenades on the enemy side. The shooting gameplay feels lazily developed and rather trite except the hero side has liberal use of technological powers, including the ability to use element zero to make black holes. The nicely balanced gameplay of shooting and power use makes for a fresh and exciting tactical shooter. The second pillar of the gameplay is the conversation. This is the players real chance to alter the storyline. Imagine how much more fun you could have in ""Call of Duty"" if you could talk the characters into avoiding the next explosion that blurs your vision and rings your ears. The character loyalty missions are back from ""Mass Effect 2"", but here they are bigger and necessary to win the war. ""Mass Effect 2"" was fun, and self parodying, but ""Mass Effect 3"" is the grown up version, where Shepard doesn't go on missions just to get laid.",10,2014-07-16,XBOX 360,user

AJ_antipop,"Is the ending disappointing? Yes, very much so. Does that alone make this game awful as a whole? Absolutely not.

Overall, this is still an excellent game, but the ending (even with the free DLC) does hinder it a bit. I can certainly see why people were so mind-numbingly upset before the DLC came out, as the original ending has an extreme lack of details. I'd still recommend it to fans and anyone who likes RPG's and/or shooters, but BE SURE to download the DLC Ending, as I feel that's part of the reason I wasn't as furious as many others.",8,2014-04-15,XBOX 360,user

S0me_Guy,"GOOD: Great story(obviously, it's BioWare); Awesome and funny characters and the game did a great job of making me care about them; Fixed the terrible ending and 2 things you'll notice after seeing the new ending: first, most of the choices you made in the past games and this game actually matter and second, it shows how BioWare cares about their fans by making a new ending that the fans deserved; All of the notable characters in the past games at least make a cameo; improved and faster combat system; No more class restrictions on weapons; New romance options; New and better weapons; New weapon customization; Added new powers to use and all are good; New Gears Of War type of melee animations; New stuff to buy at shops; New and improved leveling system(like a combination of the leveling systems of the first 2 games); Your ship is larger; Reapers have been added to the galaxy map; Throughout the game, you'll gain war assets which will help the final mission; Awesome boss battle with a Reaper on Rannoch; 35-40 hours campaign; Tons of replay ability with multiple classes and being good or bad(just like the past 2 games); Surprisingly fun multiplayer with playing as different races and teamwork is important(level capped at 20); Free multiplayer DLCs with new races, upgrades, weapons, enemies, and maps BAD: The original ending got me pissed off(thankfully they changed it); The Prothean was on a day one DLC(bullcrap because that is one of the most important characters of the entire series); There is no final boss battle; No space combat(even though there are cutscenes of your ship in the middle of huge space battles); Can't use the Hammerhead vehicle which was the best in the series; Character customization is still not that good FINAL VERDICT: This game is amazing with a ton of improvements, it does have problems but the game itself is great. I was going to give this game a 9/10, but BioWare actually care about their fans to make a new ending which is why it will end up as a 10/10. If you are an action game fan or an RPG fan, you must own this game forever. In my opinion, it is the best game of 2012!",10,2014-04-07,XBOX 360,user
ProximateXbox,I absolutely love this game. it is completely story driven with great character development and epic gameplay. It is also the only game I think I have ever released emotional feelings about as the story and the dire situations kept me engaged at all times. I honestly believe this is the best game I have ever played. as It was more compelling and engaging than any other game I had ever played. I recommend this for any sci-fi fan. but to actually get the absolute true experience they must play the first 2 games. and perhaps they will get the same feeling I had when I completed this one. The people at bioware know what they are doing and I'm extremely excited for Mass effect 4.,10,2014-03-13,XBOX 360,user
DragonBall,"I won't go into detail, but I have to say this: the ending of Mass Effect 3 is easily the lowest point in the trilogy. The Extended Cut DLC makes it better (I recommend you download and install that before playing), but even then it's still a low point. Other than that, it stands up to the high bar that the previous two games set. However, just like with Mass Effect 2, I recommend that you play through ME1, transfer your save to ME2, then transfer your ME2 save to ME3. It just makes the game that little bit better. The Mass Effect trilogy is an absolute must play.",9,2014-03-13,XBOX 360,user

dogboat333,"Look, the main reason people hate this game is because of the ending, and... yeah, it ****. I can sum it up without even spoiling it: red, blue, or green. Then there was the Day 1 DLC with Javik, the complete failure to get Talimancers like me to shut up with Tali's lazily photoshopped face, and the watering down of the third to make it a 3rd person futuristic Call of Duty game. But... I still loved this game. So much awesome... even if the action is overdone, it's still awesome. Game Play; fantastic. Soundtrack; fantastic. Characters; fantastic. Story; fantastic... until those last ten minutes, of course. This may not be everyone's cup of tea, but this is fantastic.",9,2014-01-15,XBOX 360,user
Seamus100,"Overall I enjoyed this game and the prior series. I've played it multiple times as a new game and importing a previously played character from ME1, ME2, and ME3, and as a male and female, and that had full Paragon and Renegade so I got my moneys worth out of it. What I found disappointing is that not all of the choices I made in ME1 and ME2 affected my ME3 character. For example: I know I destroyed the Collector base, but in my imported game it said I saved it, and the illusive man even mentions it in conversation that I saved it, but I know I destroyed it. I also didn't like they way they changed the look of Ashley! She looks like Miranda. I didn't have a problem with the graphics or sound. I think they were good. I don't recall if there was music, but if so I usually turn off the music in my games so I can't comment on it. I bought and downloaded the weapons packages only to find out that in some of the missions you get better ones, like rescuing the student on the space station (where Jack is teaching, if you saved Jack) so that DLC was a waste of money. The searching for minerals was rather tedious, but better then ME1's way of collecting them. And the other DLC missions should have been part of the game or at least free to download/add on. I'm really torn between giving this game a 7 or 8. I'd like to give the game a 7.5. Maybe I'm cheap, but I'm going to give a 7 just because the DLC weapons, additional uniform, and mission should have been part of the game or available for download.",7,2014-01-03,XBOX 360,user
Matty888,"This is an amazing game. The immersive single-player actually includes characters you feel something for, and the choices you make impact the game heavily. The best thing id say about this game is the customization of powers and weapons. The ending is good, the only problem with it is its 3 different endings that actually end up with all the same outcome. The game might as well have said ""what colour would you like the destruction of the universe to be?"" After 3 great games, it ends with shephard dying for his galaxy, even though he didnt really need to die? Oh well, lets see what mass effect 4 has in store for us.",9,2014-01-02,XBOX 360,user
Whitewarrior115,"Mass Effect 3 has one of the best written stories i have seen in a game. It is an epic and interesting story throughout and has very good dialog.

PicklesOfWar,"MASS EFFECT 3 is an excellent game with a top notch story, gameplay and the presentation is phenomenal. Bioware couldn't have ended the Sheppard trilogy any better. Throughout its 12 hour campaign i never got bored and just wanted more, the game is vast and you will have a lot of locations and planets to visit before the finale on earth and the ending is spectacular but not to everyone's tastes, which i understand. Its a (A,B,C) ending with very little differences but it was well written, even with the extended cut version there were still plot holes which need explaining big time",7,2013-12-17,XBOX 360,user
huss2215,"Graphics: The graphics are starting to look a little out dated but there are moments where they look amazing. Mostly when there’s blue lighting. 9.0. Sound: Professional Bioware voice acting as you know it, themes were great. 10. Gameplay: The gameplay feels a little more casual than usual, although it is very similar to Mass Effect 2 (at least for my character). RPG elements are similar, but the game doesn’t need any tweaks, it seems just fine. The problem with the gameplay is that it gets way to repetitive, and I went ahead and did every mission available. It feels like a chore at times, and some moments that are meant to be scripted events, look only decent. In my opinion they should have left the scripted events to the professionals at Naughty Dog, but there are still okay moments, but nothing that will drop you out of your seat. Mass Effect 2 was better in almost every way. The way the game builds relationships is a lot more strict than in the previous game. Still with some of those cons, Mass Effect 3’s gameplay is still a must play, especially those like myself who transferred their saves since the first title. 8.5. Story: The story was a pretty good story, and near the ending it did get ridiculous but it was still okay. I didn’t really understand all the outrage just because of the ending, it was still a proper way to end a trilogy assuming that was Biowares goal. 8.0. Lasting Appeal: The game is still worth the buy, I clocked almost 30hours, doing everything. 10. Overall Score: 9.1 out of 10.",9,2013-11-14,XBOX 360,user
KotorFan3231,"This is definitely one of the best games i have ever played, and personally one of my favorites of all time. The story and characters are above average in fact they are the best i have ever seen in any game to date. There is so much emotion in the dialogue, the action is intense, well presented, and cinematic. The choices your character makes are more impact full. There is one instance in the game i won't spoil for anyone but it involves the Geth, and Tali, and one of the choices made me feel so much emotion i almost cried. Fortunately i ran into very little glitches. My personal favorite character from this game other than commander Shepard is The Illusive Man voice by Martin Sheen, he is well voiced, and character is well written. Now the only other problem with the game that i found was there were less companions, but each were interesting so that didn't bother me that much. For the people who say the ending ruined the game it didn't yes the original ending did not solve much it was just inconclusive but did not ruin the whole game. The ending did not interfere with my experience because overall the writing was extremely strong. There is a massive amount of content in this game. It took me Thirty plus hours. Overall i give this game a Ten, and it does not mean that the game is perfect it just means the pros far outweigh the cons.",10,2013-11-12,XBOX 360,user
Masters_Che,"Mass Effect 3 is the epic conclusion of one of the most ambitious, memorable, amazing stories in modern media. The lore is rich, but relatable and accessible. In this, the 3rd installment of the trilogy, Commander Shepard (the protagonist) is tasked with confronting a massive threat to the galaxy while being tasked with forging tenuous alliances with other races that aren't on the best terms with each other. Compared to earlier Mass Effect games, the combat has been refined. The controls feel responsive and crisp. I no longer felt as though Shepard was dragging a piano behind him as in previous games. You're also able to roll, which makes a huge difference in this game given the faster paced combat and more intelligent AI (e.g. they will flank you and bust you out of cover). In addition, power combos have been enhanced. To me, it's one of the things I love most about the game play. You have the ability to inflict more damage by hitting an enemy with a particular power (e.g. telekinetic/mystic, tech-based and grenadier for the uninitiated) and then following up with another special power that creates an effect that adds more damage and potentially causes collateral damage to nearby enemies. In addition, I really enjoyed seeing how the story arch does take into consideration your choices from the previous installments. While some of these past choices only affect minor aesthetic aspects of the experience (e.g. you see some generic character in a particular role than a character from Mass Effect ""one""), others have implications that extend to the epilogue (e.g. the fate of a particular race). Be warned, if you've grown to care about any character from these games, then you will cry. Often. Most of these tears can be attributed to direct shots to your heart via non-exploitative nostalgia and very touching/tender moments. The music score in this game is epic. Clint Mansell (frmly Pop Will Eat Itself, Trent Reznor buddy, Grammy nominated composer of the score from ""Black Swan"") lends his talents and provides some of the most heart swelling pieces I've ever heard. Not to mention the amazing talents of Sam Hulick. I cannot tell you the number of times I've listened to the main soundtrack.... As for the technical aspects: Great graphics and sound. Yes, there are the occasional texture pop-in issues (which can be minimized by installing the game) and the odd glitches that range from peculiar to downright unnerving. There's one glitch that I consistently encounter in the game with every play thru that played a role in me scoring the game a 9 versus 10. It's not game breaking, but more immersion breaking. It doesn't last long, but it will haunt your dreams... Overall, the critical/story advancing missions where fun and fast paced; however, I wish there were more opportunities to explore as opposed to being compelled to push forward. While in retrospect, I've regarded the Mako-based missions from the first game to be a bit tedious; having played through it again I have to admit that I kind of miss them and the sense of scale that being able to explore a sandbox brought to the experience. However, one has to weigh that against the overall sense of urgency that the game creates, both inherent to the plot and with nice little music tricks (e.g., more frantic movements in the music which gets your heart racing). Side quests for the most part, are relegated to ""Fly here, scan this planet, collect item, bring back to someone in the Citadel"". This was a truly missed opportunity to have more fleshed out missions and combat. Also, War Assets, gained by completing missions and helping other races' militaries/leadership, are a pretty neat way of ensuring people complete as many side quests as possible to get the ""best ending""; the threshold for getting the ""best ending"" is easily attained. This is especially true if you play the fantastic, though simplistic multiplayer, and if you play any of the DLC. While speaking in superlatives about this franchise has become esoteric controversy w/in the more ardent rank and file within the Mass Effect fanbase, ironically, these words are the best way I can express my opinion of this game and the franchise overall. Despite some of its short comings, I was more than satisfied with the experience, from beginning to end and I highly recommend it. IMPORTANT NOTE: Make sure you have the Extended Cut downloaded. It makes a huge difference in the ending of the game so I would say it is **** it's free. Furthermore, though not essential, I recommend that ""From Ashes"", ""Leviathan"" and ""The Citadel"" DLCs be purchased. These are fantastic pieces of add-on content for those who can't get enough of the lore and character interactions. Omega is an ok piece of DLC, but it feels more like an option than any other DLC in the franchise.",9,2013-10-09,XBOX 360,user
DeathtoSpongify,"This game is the best possible way the Mass Effect Trilogy could have ended. Although the characters and story are so nuanced that it takes a player with a real attention to detail to get the full experience, this game has very few shortcomings. At the outset, ME3 impresses with solid mechanics, great visuals, and carefully executed dialogue. This really is the best combination of shooter and RPG that I have ever seen. The game takes great care to make your character feel like yours, moreso even than games like Skyrim or Oblivion. When played to the extent to which it was intended, Mass Effect 3 offers deep sentimental attachments to a multitude of characters, as well as a story that, although slightly predictable, is so involved that it is rendered unforgettable.",10,2013-09-20,XBOX 360,user

Fenchurch1,"All the stops have been pulled out to make this the best Mass Effect yet with improved graphics and visuals making the cut scenes all the more enjoyable. Added depth in weapon customisation, improved audio and more information than you can ever need or want to read. A wealth of back-story and information on races and planets is also available for anyone who likes that kind of thing. The voice acting and scriptwriting is great, as has become standard for Mass Effect and the AI has been improved to make combat more intense and challenging than ever.",9,2013-08-30,XBOX 360,user
Spidercolt,"A huge disappointment. The game was clearly put together in a rush and EA made it blatantly obvious, if you have been following the Mass Effect series since the first game then you will know that it is a very well written space drama that got you immersed within the first hour of playing the first 2 games yet whilst playing Mass Effect 3 the immersion was destroyed on numerous occasions by various mistakes e.g. sprites that have been placed that have no reason for being there and on one occasion a sprite that just walked around in circles. I wouldn't suggest this game to anyone as I know it is a poorly made third-person and its bad enough to make fans of the previous games cry.",2,2013-08-27,XBOX 360,user
ClassyDromedary,"Mass Effect is to games as ""The Godfather"" is to movies, it will be one of the few to be remembered by future generations. I could ramble on about the great graphics, intuitive game-play, and fun multi-player, but I will not, as that would distract you from the greatest draw of the game. It is a literary masterpiece, an epic of our times. Full of rich characters, grave loss, and hope. (Think Braveheart) . Many people dislike the ending to the story, much as many despise the classics of literature. I think the main cause of this is that the ending fills you with grief, something very few games can do. The fact that it causes you a negative emotion in the first place shows that there is literary power here. This is not game of the year people, this is the ending to the series of the decade. It's been a hell of a ride.",10,2013-08-19,XBOX 360,user
miramax123,"At first, I gave this game a 9 for the fact that the music wasn't as rushed as ME2 majority of sounndtracks, for their aesthetically-compensating atmosphere, the moderate depth in characters' feelings about the Reaper War and the improved gameplay movement, flow, speed and resolution, although the power recharge system is still there which was kind of a bummer since ME2 you can't constantly use powers without having them all charging just to use one power. And the soundtracks were absoulute emotional originality! However, despite thinking and thinking more about how MUCH potential this game seriously had, I realized that the EA gaining full control of the franchise after ME2 was just middle finger to veteran fans and a cynical step TOO FAR! The flaws are established; The villains weren't at their most authentic evil, like Kai Leng, who I thought was a superficial rather than a dangerous assassins, Harbinger not getting enough establishment at all, Sovereign was by far the most terrifying verbally and villanous character in the trilogy from ME1, no planetary exploration and instead like ME2, you get an even worse and less captivating side missions just to prolong the original game time, storyline was the main crap that was a bloody punch to the face by Bioware to all of us ME fans, the vaguely rushed, inexplicable and confusing endings were just a mockery to the entire trilogy!! Bioware needs to get their magic back that once manifested in ME and ME... ME3 just had NO diversity in missions, not enough ndifferent enemies, and the most ridiculous of them all, is on the Insanity mode, you instantly get cheap deaths by three randomly stupid husks and a ridiculously annoying Marauder shooting at you while your Shepard is annoyingly shaking from the targetting system, preventing you to kill that last idiot! Bioware just shoved their heads down with EA, not enough impact from decision making from the previous ME and ME2 decisions, although the Javik and Citadel party DLC's were fun, this was just overall bullcrap to me. Satisfactory for gameplay, but replay value for story and real gameplay is no worth whatsoever. BIOWARE MAKE MASS EFFECT 4 COUNT whatever you tend to call the next game!",7,2013-08-17,XBOX 360,user
tech953,"I can't believe how stupid 90% of the reviewers on this game are being. This game, no this series, is the pinnacle of video games inception into mature, well thought out story telling and emotionally jarring character building. The tension and the moral choices, combined with the stellar voice cast and excellent writing, help center the finale of this game series with a bang, creating some of the hardest decisions that I have ever made in any video game. I literally cried when both Garrus and Tali, who I had gotten very attached to, died in that final rush, an result to the well put together characters, and the bonds that you gain with them. The ending, while similar either way, ties the series up beautifully, and on top of that, possibly TOPS the last two. When I say that, I am mostly referring to the lack of customization that you are all complaining about in the ending from the vast amount of choices you made. To be totally honest, you never really saw the results of your choices in the previous games, until you played the next one. In the first game, you didn't see the results of saving the council really take effect until you met them in the next game.

All the excitement that had been building up over the course of the game, and also it's two predecessors, is extinguished immediately and in the worst way, leaving you with the inescapable feeling of being ripped off.

By being the final installment of a trilogy, it has a tremendous amount of pressure to tie all loose ends and satisfy story arcs so that gamers will be whetted for a new hero and new series. If one plays this stand-alone, which I think is a ridiculous idea, but the game is set up to accustom one for such a scenario it would rank much higher. But as part of a set and the end of that set, it grades lower. The ending, is such a punch, It really robs the whole theme of the trilogy, perseverance. There was an attempt to fix it, and it works for some, not for others. There is good here, it doesn't deserve the absolute bottom of the barrel scores.

I liked the campaign, because once again it had great characters and side missions that weren't delivery missions, but without ripping apart its ending, Mass Effect 3 doesn't have the same appeal as Mass Effect 1.

Johng4,"This is the first mass effect game i have ever played. In short i like it. I have not officially beaten the game but i have played it enough to get the gist of how the game runs. One thing so far i do not like about the game is i just hit disc two and i have done two sections so far in the game where i actually get to shoot things, in between that time are two very long and drawn out parts where you talk to people on the citadel to recruit new members for the alliance and get resources for the war and get to know the characters, at first i didnt mind then i thought,, hmm i wanna shoot stuff. And the shooting and combat is something i really like about this game its fluid fast and fun and you have alot of options going into batlle. You have your standard stuff like guns and stuff but you also have powers and abilities as do your aliies which you can direct them to do at any given time after the cooldown. The story is good even to someone who hasnt been with the series for the whole ride it does a decent job of getting you up to speed of whats going on, since i havnt played the other mass effects(yet) its safe to say im not getting the whole experience because im pretty sure if had played one and two my decisions in those two games wouldve made the experience completeley different for me because thats how things work in mass effect, your desicions. Over all i like this game and i hate to see all these people knocking it because they didnt like the ending thats not a factor in a game that should determine whether or not it is good or not",8,2013-05-04,XBOX 360,user

Then the original ending, which is total crap and I want to give the game a -10 after finished the game the first time, it deserved a negative score. the ending made me depressed and lost interesting in playing games for months, the reaction and PR bxx**** from bioware towards ending and fans was just disgusting and made me sick.

The game has done things right: graphics, soundtrack, combat, multiplayer, these ""touching moments""... yet it still fails to satisfy completely. Some important story-arcs are completely cut off, certain characters were simply dismissed, side-missions are almost non-existent, the writing is laughable at points and (this has already been discussed to death) the terrible ending happened.

Settlestone,"To start off, I've yet to reach the ending of mass effect 3. I assume I'm getting close, 24 hours in or so. I had an idea a month or so ago to play all three in a row, because I forgot what happened in the first two games. So I replayed through the first, loved it, damn fine game. Replayed the second, also sweet, got a bit bored of the planet scanning after awhile, but besides that highly enjoyed it. And then I started 3. I don't honestly understand how this game got such a high review. The entire system was dumbed down, all mini games removed, almost all exploration removed, no characters to gather, silly dream sequence scenes that always end exactly the same. Canned dialogue, removal of REAL side quests and a new, insanely annoying combat system where every single npc strafes at Mach speed. There's so much wrong with this it's hard for me to find anything fun, new or cool. I have no desire to finish the game, Ashley looks like a man, all of my companions are boring, oh, the one binary puzzle level was sort of neat albeit a tad frustrating. As I said I played each concurrently, the second I finished the first I started the second, same with second to third. My score relies on the fact to me, from my perspective, that this was and is a piss poor representation to an up to this point, awesome franchise, I think it's ea..

Vanadium,"This is a very good game, and has been exposed to far too much negative publicity. It has been a brilliant series, and this is a very good continuation of the Mass Effect trilogy. The gameplay is better than any previous installment, with good graphics and some missions being very well executed and thought out: Tuchanka and Rannoch in particular. That said, the lack of more conversation decisions, and less squad members, as well as the now infamous ending might plague the game somewhat. The multiplayer in itself is very addictive, a fun Horde mode where the main problem is an infuriatingly unlikely random store, which seems to be an excuse for those dreaded microtransactions. All in all, Mass Effect 3 is a great game, all though it may be slightly plagued by some problems blown way out of proportion.",9,2013-03-21,XBOX 360,user
EWD,"In an industry of the quick one-liner shooter and linear choice rpg I find it good to see some writing power being put behind a game to give it more of a endearing and drawing in quality. Mass effect's universe has always given players more in the way of choices, relationship development and Mass effect 3 has now promised to give us the fruits of our labor. I come to really enjoy every person I meet in the game and the inspired locations in it and It did make me feel as though what I did in the game's shaped the universe around me and most popular games just don't give you that, really doesn't. Now my thoughts on the linear endings is that for me I was playing for the in game experience and I knew that there would be more games and like past games in the series I never really see the ""end"" as a final game and I didnt expect developers to have the time to come up with hundreds of different endings for every choice we made, though they shouldn't of promised that but its a mistake people make them. I'm satisfied with how they rectified the problem people had and will be back.",9,2013-03-18,XBOX 360,user
Mothman13,I'll start right off the bat that Mass Effect 3 is a good **** isn't as good as Mass Effect 1 & 2 and as a final part of Commander Shephard's story it doesn't fully deliver. The choices you made in the last games don't effect the story that much and the ending seems forced and not fitting at all. It is easily the weakest of the otherwise amazing trilogy.,7,2013-03-16,XBOX 360,user
Auritone,"I... What... This is... I can't... (adopting James Earl Jones voice) NOOOOOOOOO!!!! There simply aren't words that can adequately describe how incredibly disappointed I was with this title. The sheer dumbing and scaling down and utter contrived nonsense of this game simply defies belief. To summarize: The conversation wheel is reduced to mostly two choices, which most of the time are just verbal variations of the very same choice. The Citadel has been reduced to four very small ""rooms"" which make you feel like you're in a dorm rather than a huge construction floating in space. The story makes little to no sense what so ever (and that's well before one of the worst, most contrived, horribly written, and senseless endings in the history of writing). Side missions consists primarily of Shep playing UPS-guy. Here's how it works: Eavesdrop on total stranger, go to system, scan planet, find object, go back, deliver found object to total stranger, the end. And if you thought Bioware couldn't make scanning planets more absurdly boring than it was in ME2 (where it actually served some kind of purpose), then you're in for a surprise. Imagine playing Tetris with only square blocks which take up the entire grid. That's scanning planets in ME3. You don't really do anything. The shooting levels are extremely linear and makes the whole game feel more like an attempt at a Gears of War clone with longer cutscenes (and a still dysfunctional AI) than Mass Effect. Oh, and did I mention the sheer amount of auto dialogue? Then there's Tali's face... Oh God, how lazy can you get? Then there's the IGN chick. WHAT!? And then there's the ending... You know, the one where all the decisions you made throughout the three games come together and gives you a plethora of different endings? Well, no! No choices you ever made make even one iota of difference. Everybody gets the same three completely ridiculous, contrived, senseless, and grotesquely illogical choices of endings. Remember we were told that the Reapers were beyond human comprehension? Well, it turns out they were right. Noone can possibly comprehend the assenying, senseless stupidity which is the Reapers and the Catalyst (or smurfboy aka deux ex machina). To sum up: Mass Effect 3 is a boring 3rd person shooter with long cutscenes and a completely senseless story and one of the worst conclusions ever in gaming history. The only reason I can swing my way up to a four, is the production value which is excellent and the fact that there is actually two missions in this game that has the old Mass Effect feel of choice and consequence. But twice simply isn't enough when we consider that was the whole premiss of the game. The story of the Mass Effect franchise is the story of how game companies all now seem to aim for the lowest common denominator (aka ""as long as I can shoot stuff and don't have to actually think or do anything, I'm happy"") rather than aim for excellence.",4,2013-03-14,XBOX 360,user

Lieber,"Mass Effect 3 is both a testament to show how low EA has dragged Bioware. On the other hand, it IS a good game. Graphics look great, the RPG elements have been improved and the general gameplay is great. You can pretty much cut ME3 in three. Average/Amazing/Bad, for Opening/Majority of Game/Ending. Even with the Extended Cut, the ending is not satisfying for long time fans of the series, and it's really a shame. Other issues include tons of auto-dialogue, a focus on Cerberus instead of the Reapers and the fetch quests they replaced normal side quests with. Your ME2 squadmates are completely sidelined, but that is Mass Effect 2's Suicide Mission's fault. So why did I rate it 8/10? Because it is a good game. Just not a great Mass Effect game.",8,2013-03-09,XBOX 360,user
Gargus,"I'm not here to rip on ME3 just for the sake of doing so or because its what's cool to do on the internet like so many others. Basically ME3 is the worst of the series in every way possible compared to the other 2 games because it doesn't build or improve anything. It simply just tries to hurriedly finish the series for the sake of a cash in on the title. 1- There is no sense of exploration. The game as efficiently as possible holds your hand every step the way and has you actually being on the ground doing things the least amount possible. Side missions are carried out by quickly scanning a planet ala ME2 and then firing a probe. That's it. You don't explore, you don't get to check out uncharted worlds simply for the sake of curiosity or anything. Scan, shoot probe, side mission done all without even leaving the galaxy map. This tactic accounts for the majority of side missions. ME1 you could explore the galaxy drive around in that horribly handling buggy and had a sense of discovering things, ME2 you could land on planets and explore doing side missions with some not even firing a single shot like the crashed cruiser balanced on the mountain peak but all of those things are gone in 3. The game just holds your hand and ushers you from mission to mission. 2- You don't get to actually chose anything, everything is pre determined for you. Even if you chose the renegade or paragon path you get the exact same result and no one treats you differently and you get no alternative paths depending on your karma scale which makes it all incredibly pointless and just window dressing for the fact the story is entirely linear and so is your character. 3- The characters are all the same ones, only less compelling. There are a couple new characters but they are highly disposable and not even worth messing with. James for instance is basically just a guy who talks 90% of the time like a generic white guy, 10% of the time he throws out some Mexican phrases like saying ""loco"" a lot in his generic white guy trying to impersonate a Mexican guy and he looks like he was taken from the show jersey shore. When a old character returns you can see it coming a mile away. For instance you go into a area where the mission briefing talks about geth then you can see 45 minutes before which old character is going to come back. All the characters themselves seem hollow and rushed, they lack the personality that made them endearing in the other games and most are there only long enough to be overly obvious in a very specific mission or they simply show up for 3 minutes of camera time practically winking at the player with a nod and then are gone. 4- The story compared to the others ****. The other games had side stories, character stories, side missions with their own short stories and so on. ME3 on the other is basically this ""Everything is going to be destroyed"". That's pretty much it because no matter where you go or what you do its always about the war specifically and nothing else. I also got sick of hearing phrases like ""were here to save lives"", ""were doing this to save lives"", ""this weapon will save lives"", ""we need to stick together to save lives"", ""billions of lives are on the line and were here to save them"", etc and after about 8 hours I was sick of hearing about the war and saving lives. 5- The game play was basically just one big shooting gallery and hiding behind chest high walls. Every single fight is basically you hiding behind chest high walls to peak out and fire a few rounds only to hide back behind said wall. It was incredibly boring and has been done to death in dozens of other games. The combat was mindless and mediocre. It felt like they put absolutely no effort into the combat at all and rushed you through it in order to get to the next scene of hearing Sheppard say ""saving lives"". 6- The ending was atrocious. This is a series that prides itself on story, characters and dialogue. We all spent over 100 bucks playing all 3 games and spent over 100 hours playing all 3 games but bioware seemed to say ""This is the end of the trilogy so who cares about the ending"". The ending is the most important part of any story of any kind because its the very last thing you leave the person with and its supposed to be a reward, the climax to everything leading up till then, basically the ending is the most important part of any story. But the ending of ME3 was over in just a minute or so despite the dozens of hours of dialogue, cut scenes and story in the rest of the series they got lazy at the end. It gives no satisfaction at all. I can honestly say it is the laziest segment of the series. I did like though they had the balls to do what they did with Sheppard, but the ending still **** and doesn't make you glad to have finished the series.",1,2013-03-07,XBOX 360,user

If you played the first two Mass Effect games and want to enjoy more then don't be turned off my the rumors of the ending. While the ending is not anything you would expect, at it's core the gameplay is by far the best ever in Mass Effect 3. The multi-player is also an added bonus. Originally everyone was skeptical about the mutli-player component, but with an assortment of free DLC associated with it you can't go wrong playing some Mass Effect co-op with friends.

Tofusin,"The end to a Legend. Mass effect 3, the conclusion to the story of Commander (insert first name here) Shepard. Been a hell of a ride, from Eden Prime to Omega, and everywhere in-between. Mass Effect 3 beings after the events of the Arrival DLC for Mass Effect 2. Cmdr. Shepard having been arrested, and facing trial,on Earth, is interrupted with the Reaper's invasion. And Shepard is given one final mission: Unite the Galaxy to combat them. No easy task, but years have been spent for this very moment. Shepard is faster and stronger now. With combat rolls, cover vaults and devastating melee attacks. He/She is joined by a smaller (But more vocal) squad. All previous squad-mates, main characters from previous games return. Though some are placed in corners, and given little screen-time. The weapon crafting system is a fun little addition, even if you won't be using it much. The mining mini-game is gone, (Hurray!) and planet scanning is simplified. The game leads through many emotional moments, some of anger and hate. Others of happiness, and joy. But the leading is pressure, desperation and tragedy. Keep tissues near you for this game. A work of art for 99% of the **** you've heard it a million times.

EddieHokie,"Boy, talk about a game developer living by the idea of ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"". This could easily be a Mass Effect 2 expansion pack as it plays, feels, and looks just like the previous game. And although this would seem like a good thing, the story is now bogged down by too many chance encounters and contrived story telling. I don't want to by chance run into everything character I ran with in the previous game in a massive universe unless it makes sense to and ME 3 forces me to see my fellow squad mates in the most random and coincidental ways that it makes it all feel icky. The game has been replaced by all out action which will keep some people happy. It just lacks the heart of the first 2 games.

MetalTree,"Personally, I don't quite understand all the negative fuss about the ending. It's original, was hard to predict, and far from most Hollywood-sauce game endings, which is a very good thing. It's the gameplay that really matters, and for me, who appreciates more action than lengthly (and sometimes cheesy) dialogues, Mass Effect 3 just delivers. The combat parts are improved from ME2: better graphics, better (though not perfect) controls, and much more fun. Overall, it's a must-buy, fan of the series or not. The plus: - Really good and unpredictable story - Addictive combat scenes: after beating the game, I just wanted to go back to my saved missions and do the action parts again an again. So good that after playing a few hours of Halo4 (yawn...), I came back to ME3. - Incredible character design at the beginning (well like other MEs) - The Banshees: OMG... - The sound (music is okay; sound effects are great) - Terrific voice acting, and ...Martin Sheen as the Illusive Man, again. - The unbelievable richness of the ME universe (All credible species, civilization, planets, etc. up to nauseating details in the Codex... wow.) The minus: - Earth final mission rarely looks as a huge battlefield. I would have liked flanking dozens of allied fighters against the same amount of Reapers in the action sequences. Instead, it's always you and your 2 teammates against hordes of the same monsters, over and over, and cut scenes in between with huge battlefields to make you think you are part of a planetary **** failed. - Some lazy rip-offs from science fiction movies: Dune, Aliens, Star Wars. But hey, that's forgiveable. - Controls that still get in the way sometimes: trying to punch an enemy sometimes lets you 'slip' in front of him (use a kind of lock-on mechanism next time, please), just to get stabbed in the back after. - AI that is most of the time excellent, but sometimes strange: Cerberus soldiers are so strong, I don't see why they are not more aggressive (even in Insanity mode), and why they don't come more directly at you instead of retreating most of the time and hiding for long periods. If you are separated from them by a single obstacle, they will flee instead of jumping over to kick your ass. Sometimes, you are standing in front of a soldier, and... he does nothing, no shooting at all. Okay for easier modes, but unforgiveable for Insanity.",9,2013-02-02,XBOX 360,user

Both my wife and I played all three games and we both had the same reaction to the end. What interns made this ending? The concept philosophy of the end was right on the mark for a Sci-Fi.

Socratease,"First off, i would like to point out that the ending has been talked about to death. So instead of pointing out how it committed story telling suicide (which it did), i`m going to focus on the rest of the game. 1. The Intro. Seriously, WHY would shepard, the renegade badass (in my playthrough) just sit around WAITING for the reapers to arrive for those few months in between ME3 and arrival? That doesn`t seem very shepard like. And why should i give a sh-- about some random kid? Verdict: bad writing. 2. Cerberus. So, a rogue terrorist organization goes from having only a hundred and fifty members just a few months ago to being the empire of star wars with almost limitless troops....... Yeah, sure. tell me another one, casey. Verdict: bad writing 3. Kai-lang. I have never been so annoyed by an emo **** of a video game character as i was by Kai-lang. As razorfist, my favorite youtube reviewer put it: if for the past decade the illusive man had access to a gravity defying emo space ninja with a katana that slices through mother f---ing planets, and with magic plot device powers that allowed him to track the movement of every sentient being in the galaxy, then why in F--K would he resurrect commander shepard?! Verdict: bad writing 4. Harbinger. Did harbinger just say screw it and go on a fishing trip when it came time for the invasion? Why was he portrayed as the ultimate badass reaper in ME2 only to be given a rediculous cameo in ME3? Verdict: bad writing 5. The ''arrival'' of the reapers. Okay, stop me if you`ve heard this one: Why did the reapers cross the void? To get to our galaxy, you gleefully respond. But HOW did they get to our galaxy? That`s right: They couldn`t have. Remember ME1? Remember when we stopped saren from activating the citadel so that the reapers could pour through? Remember the arrival DLC, where we blew up an entire solar system to stop them? So answer me this: if all the posible relays the reapers could have used were destroyed: HOW. IN. FU-- did they get here? Answer: they didn`t. Verdict: laughably bad writing 6. So the quariens go to war whether you pushed them towards it or not in ME2. And the point of having the option to say: good luck in the war, or: The reapers are coming, i`m going to need every ship i can get was.......? Verdict: far too heavy an emphasis on the illusion of choice, and not enough emphasis on MEANINGFUL choice. 7. The god d--n kid. I know this has been voiced at least a million times, but i`m going to say it anyway: why should my character, who has seen hundreds of innocent men, women, and children being liquified into a human reaper give even a marginal sh-- about ONE KID? They might as well have had giant flashing letters on my screen that said: FEEL SAD NOW. Verdict: atrocious writing And my verdict for the entire game is: Terrible. The most badly written game in the series with the most badly written ending in the history of video game trilogys. Don`t buy it. Not even if it`s in the bargain bin.

FierroSuave,"I let my Mass Effect 3 experience sit and gestate for nearly a year before I felt I could properly describe the sensations that it evoked. It was a single feeling, it was like somebody with less knowledge of the source material was telling a condensed ending over mouthfuls of hamburger in a high school cafeteria. True there were parts that ended exactly as they should and it played exactly like I expected it to with multiplayer in the mix. Just felt as though there was more to the story than fist bumps and Freddie Prinze Jr. would allow,",4,2013-01-20,XBOX 360,user
kigl,"As a fan of the series, this game deviated from its original roots as a predominant RPG with shooter elements to now a predominately a shooter with a skin of a RPG elements. Even neglecting the rampant on disk DLC and plot hole ridden ending, the game is blatantly average. As a shooter it is adequate offering the staple cover shooter. However, the cover mechanics are often clunky in comparison to other games in the same genre. The game has roughly the same RPG elements as Mass Effect 2, while limiting, adds at least some flavor to the shooter Bioware/EA have turned the series into. The gameplay is not where Mass Effect 3 does poorly. It is the practices regarding story-necessary DLC and essentially the last 20 minutes of the game's story. The game wraps up many of the persisting conflicts of the series, only to introduce rampant deus ex machina and plot holes in the games final minutes. The altered Extended Cut DLC fails to address many of these plot holes as well. Bioware games are usually renown for their story and setting, but this game essentially throws this all to the wayside and leaves a bad taste in the mouth of many fans of the franchise. In all, the end result is an average cover-shooter and a series whose universe is tarnished in the name of ""artistic integrity"".",5,2013-01-17,XBOX 360,user

JoeLouis3849,"This game is everything Mass Effect wasn't. No exploration, now you slowly scan a planet and hope the game will allow you to land on the thing. Combat difficulty is no longer determined by player skill, but enemies who have infinite ammo, immunity to player attacks and can kill the player in 3 hits regardless of level. The storyline seems contrived... The whole game seems to be about collecting resources and trying to bed down one of your teammates. Virgins will get a kick out of that. FPS fans will enjoy the fact that there are little to no RPG elements that require them to use more than .006% of their brains to play this game. RPG fans will dislike this game's lackluster character development system. Me? I hate this game. That's right, I used the exact same review from Mass Effect 2. Why? Because if Bioware can't be bothered to improve the game in any way, then I can't be dithered to waste time pretending that I care enough about this abortion to write an all new review.",0,2013-01-02,XBOX 360,user

I first felt liked they ripped my heart out thinking how they could this to a beloved franchise knowing ive spent over 100hrs on this but they brought out the EC and all was forgiven in my eyes i understand peoples frustration on this but 10 min on an ending cant justify low scores on a trilogy masterpiece.,10,2012-12-29,XBOX 360,user
BelgianTofu,"Mass Effect is to games as ""The Godfather"" is to movies, it will be one of the few to be remembered by future generations. I could ramble on about the great graphics, intuitive game-play, and fun multi-player, but I will not, as that would distract you from the greatest draw of the game. It is a literary masterpiece, an epic of our times. Full of rich characters, grave loss, and hope. (Think Braveheart) . Many people dislike the ending to the story, much as many despise the classics of literature. I think the main cause of this is that the ending fills you with grief, something very few games can do. The fact that it causes you a negative emotion in the first place shows that there is literary power here. This is not game of the year people, this is the ending to the series of the decade. It's been a hell of a ride.",10,2012-12-29,XBOX 360,user

ME2, to me, is better than ME3, but ME3 is worth at least one complete playthru, and if you liked ME or ME2, you'll have fun playing ME3, even if you will be left flat or confused with the end.

But, I do get that it was the point and due to the narrative. The story is just beyond grandness and it just builds and builds until ...... you get a really anti-climatic ending?!

This game is the conclusion of your own commander shepard the way you chose to take him/her through this amazing well crafted story is met with praise and respect from your companions or the death and extinction of entire alien species.

Oxcart,"Very few times in gaming history has a title received so much controversy, so much vitriol, and been the subject of the undiluted ire of so many gamers. The source of the fury? The ending to a five-year, three-game story arc that had, by that point, drawn in so many gamers that it had transformed from game series into **** had literally undergone the Halo Effect, where an under-the-radar game ends up being such a huge franchise and dynamo of its own that it begins eclipsing itself. But the difference lies in the games: where Halo is a shooter with a lot of story laid into it, Mass Effect is fundamentally a story with a game built through it. Halo would have to try hard to screw up; as long as it provides the action and the intensity, it wins. Mass Effect never had it so easy. But that doesn't forgive what happened with the finale. Mass Effect 3 is, and may well end up being the textbook example of, a game that was set up to be great, only to be destroyed by the marketing department. The original ME laid the groundwork of a story where the player's actions MADE the story, DECIDED the plot, and were the end-all and be-all of the game. There were so many directions for the plot to go, all decided by the player. ME3 was the original ME's evil twin: a game that started off with hundreds of possible threads, only to ultimately file down to a single possible outcome, a game where all of the player's decisions, past and present, were rendered irrelevant. A great game was sacrificed on the altar of Marketing, as they tried to turn Mass Effect into something it wasn't: a mass-appeal shooter. The mutation began in the second installment, as shooter elements began overtaking role-playing elements. We gamers took this in stride, accepting the changes as some streamlining and minor changes (and, truthfully, some of the elements removed or changed were never our favorites). But something else happened: the storytelling began to be streamlined and dumbed-down as well. ME3 just finished ME2's trajectory -- straight into the dirt. In the quest for money (by trying to appeal to the largest audience), they converted Mass Effect into a nearly-brainless shooter, one which was loosely tied together with story in the game, and required story-seekers to look outside the game for real content -- they turned it into Halo: a game with a massive backstory that is only visible in the game if you know to look for it. Of course, all of this was prior to the Extended Cut DLC -- the amazing concession the gaming industry made to the Voice of the Gamers...which, really, was just placating enough to keep the masses of gamers from taking their beloved money elsewhere. EA knew it was in danger of alienating millions of money dispensers, and sought to make enough amends to avoid losing that cash. Overall, however, after all the changes the game has undergone, while it's still not particularly worthy of the Mass Effect mantle, ME3 is no longer the total pariah it had been. Decisions are back to having some value, and the previously-mandatory mobile game's value has been decreased, bringing fate back into the hands of the game...mostly. I held off on writing a review of this game when the Extended Cut was announced, otherwise it would've been another ""boycott EA"" pitchforks-and-torches rant. Now, while I'm still not pleased with the game's conclusion, it's not horrible, either, and at least does enough of a job to warrant a mediocre rating. Taken on its own, perhaps it would be considered a better game. But that's not possible. ME3 is part of a series, and a heavily connected series at that. If one of the Halo games had been a dud, it wouldn't significantly impact the others or the series as a whole; they just fix it next time, and judging it against its peers is unnecessary. But ME3 has to be held against the standards set by its **** it doesn't. Compared to the games that came before, ME3 just doesn't have what it takes to stand alongside. No matter what changes they made to the ending, it will always be a step behind. Thanks, Marketing department. Next time, stay out of the development process.",4,2012-11-18,XBOX 360,user

Fabtech23,"FULL DISCLOSURE: I am writing this review post ""ending patch."" Mass Effect 3 (and more importantly the entire series) is a triumph in video game story telling. This series has shown that interactive media can stand up to Hollywood and bring an emotional and compelling story into our living rooms and allow us to control the decisions made. The first Mass Effect revolutionized player choice. Mass Effect 2 expanded on this allowing you to completely ignore characters and their side quests, thus changing the outcome of the game, which would in turn change how Mass Effect 3 played out. Now on to Mass Effect 3. The controls are tight, the weapons have weight to them, and the story is emotionally gripping. Never once through the entire campaign did I think ""meh, well come out on top and win this."" BioWare wanted to project that sense of helplessness, and they did it well. Now, i stopped playing the game after hearing about the ending fiasco. I didnt want to see it. I didnt want the game series I loved so dearly to be ruined. I waited, and waited, and waited, and when that patch dropped, I fired my xbox up and finished the game. I was aware of how the ending played out, and with this patch applied, the ending gets a huge boost. Without it though I dont felt it would have ruined the game, not enough to justify a 0. The last 5% of the game **** does not justify giving the first 95% a bad score. Thats not how reviews work. Mass Effect 3 is a polished, emotionally gripping, fun sci-fi rpg/shooter that will make you feel for your characters, and make you think about every decision presented to you.

The best part of the game is its story and how you must form the races of all worlds and planets in the universe to fight your ulterment enemy that is threating your world in which you must leave to save at the end. Its a very hard feeling to have while enjoying yourself in the Mass Effect world and keeps you worrying and heartfelled. All the characers in this installment make there last and ultimate feeling of being a charcter who you have come to love and hate truly spectacular this feeling. The music score for the game has never been better, the music lifts you up and makes you fight and can also despress you down and make you feel helpless truly masterpiece of a score.

mailordermonstr,"BEST ENDING EVER!!!! OK, I'm just fooling around. But honestly, the ending isn't that horrible. You'll hear a lot of people complain about lack of options. This is somewhat true, but what do you expect? With the amount of choices made throughout the ME series, it would've taken individually customized endings for the thousands of different outcomes. But enough about all those whiny **** lets get to the review. If you've played the previous ME games, then you'll know pretty much what to expect when it comes to game play, graphics and sound. They're all top-notch. You'll likely run into all the characters you met in previous ME games, though your team will be made mostly of new people. The area where this installment detours is the story. Your goal in ME3 is to rally the troops for galactic war. Doesn't make for much of a story in its self, but rather offers various smaller stories as well as some closure to past stories. Will it leave you with some unanswered questions? Probably. The ME universe is simply too large for everything to be easily explained. And remember, this may be the end of Shepard's story line, but it's not the end of the ME universe. Also gone from ME is the tedious planet scanning found in ME2. Another addition of ME3 is the multiplayer. It's basically a horde mode. I had lots of fun with this and fortunately Bioware has shown a great deal of support with free DLC maps and characters. If you enjoy the combat in ME you'll enjoy this mode. If you enjoyed previous ME games, you'll enjoy this one. If you haven't played the previous games, than why are you reading this?

guest1321,"From the start I felt a sensation of profound responsibility placed on my shoulders. At times the stories urgency seemed to drift away but it never hurt slowed the story progression or deteriorate the plot. I went into it considering how annoyed I was with Mass Effect 2 and the feeling that the game was one big checklist. I never really had that feeling in Mass Effect 3 and the missions seemed to link together (main quests) and tie in (side quests) really well and that was something I truly appreciated. The emotion that Mass Effect 3 inspired in me was unlike any game I've played before. I felt pulled in to consider the feelings of the characters and try to understand what they where going through. The decisions felt meaningful and weighted with no clear option that would seem fitting of the stereotypical Sheppard. As for the mechanics of the game I was extremely impressed. Combat felt good and I hardly ever ran out of ammo which I was frustrated with at first, for having removed the authenticity of the situation, but later came to appreciate as it allowed me to focus on the game. Being able to customize weapons to the extent and ease at which Mass Effect 3 allowed was highly enjoyable. I loved being able to go from a shop which sells upgrades to buying new guns to then choosing my gun set up and finally to customizing my armor all within an area aboard the normandy. I only caught glimpses of the environment in between the action but from what I saw I was extremely impressed. Every planet I visited felt distinct aesthetically as well as layout. Sure the game had a set path for you but when the path looked as good as it did I had no issues with it. Graphically the game was a step up from its predecessor but by no means a highlight of this generation. The audio however was truly an immersive experience. The ability of the music and soundstage to go from a casual point A to point B moment and then scale up to an epic fast paced section and pull me right in was brilliant. The audio was definitely something that will bring me back to this game just for the sheer feeling of grandeur and tragedy that it invoked in me. Now that I have beat the campaign once I have been playing a lot of the multiplayer and while I was initially concerned it was going to be another online shooter it really has taken on its own form and done it in a way that suits Mass Effect very well. The fact that it ties back into the single player is also a nice feature that while probably won't have a huge effect on my play style and where I devote my time I like the fact that the two are not totally disjoint. After finishing this game I could not help but want more, something that I have not felt from a game in a while, and something that helps this game earn a perfect score in my book.",10,2012-10-11,XBOX 360,user

bigbiscits,"The true over reaction of thousands of gamers has marred this amazing genre. No this game does not live up to its predecessors in anyway. The story OPTIONS feel more streamlined than before, the game play was the same as Mass Effect 2's, and of course the polarizing ending that crushed so many individuals. The story line content felt more rushed and ""to the point"". Each mission was just pick A or B until the end. (pick A, B, or C). This was a turn off and the side missions were very boring, most of the time I would pick them up and not even know how I had since they were triggered by random conversations going on in the world as you walked by. This was a big step down from the previous titles and took away from the experience. And of course the **** insanely overly infamous, polarizing ending. I personally did not like the ending along with everyone else. It was not what I wanted for my character. I do understand that this ending is what the writer's had in mind and I respect that and wish that they had not altered it. I understand this was their masterpiece that we were getting to take part in and what they want is what ultimately will happen. I think the majority of us understood that and reluctantly accept it. What stung so much though is that we didn't know it until the end. We felt like this was OUR masterpiece. Our story, to end how WE see fit. Unfortunately it was not. The game is still great even with the less than stellar ending. PEOPLE DO NOT LET THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS SCARE YOU!!!! They are all mostly from people very (understandably) disappointed with the ending. If you have not given the Mass Effect series a try I can not recommend it to you enough. Please go get Mass Effect 1 and start from the very beginning. Go through this massive, incredible story and decide for yourself.

Diwvsen,"Mass Effect 3 is a great game with some truly emotional moments and an overall better combat-system than the previous ME games. Commander Shephard and many of the iconic characters are back to save the galaxy when the Reaper invasion finally arives during the very beginning of the game. The quest to save all life from certain annihilation takes you to many different locations, including some you already know and some you've never seen. The graphics are great, offering great environmental variety and good character-animations. There are, however, some techical issues dragging the game slightly down. Don't expect the technical leap from ME2 to this game to be as dramatic as the one between the first two games was - ME3 in many ways looks and plays the same as the second installment in the franchise. The combat system works better than ever, and this time around it feels more like an RPG-shooter than the second game did, without being as clumsy as the first one. There is a lot of emphasis on weapon, armor and skill customization, which gives you a lot of ways to experiment with various playstyles until you find one thats suits you. Enemy AI has also been significantly improved. Not only are there now a lot more different enemies, they also behave very differently and will do everything from flanking you with shields, charging you and throwing grenades at you to expose you and take you down. The level design is also much better. Fighting areas are much bigger, which gives you more mobility and makes it easier to move from cover to cover. The classes work very differently and offer in themselves reason enough to replay the game. There are a lot of ways to experiment with your skill upgrades (as skills can evolve in many different ways), and this time around every class can use every weapon type at the cost of power-cooldown, which is a great addition. The Citadel is back and very atmospheric, but unfortunately it is quite boring to hang around, as sidequests are often fetch-quests that does not fit the conflict of the game. On to the story, which of course, is the most important part of this finale. The story and conflict is epic in scale and offers some truly emotional moments and powerful choices as you resolve some of the conflicts that have been brewing throughout all three games. A lot of the characters from previous games return, some as squadmates and others as sidecharacters helping you on your quest. There are also some new characters introduced, which I think is unneccesary, since there already are so many great characters available from the previous games. Don't expect as great a cast of characters, or as great character development, as that of ME2. Despite the scale of the conflict there a lot of fetch-quest in this game. Shepard often has to drop in to save an important person, or retrieve and object, in order to get help from someone, which can feel poor from time to time. You'll also grow sick of the mission debriefings with Hacket that follows every mission. These are shallow and serves as a way to mark the end of a mission, thus giving you the feel **** divided into levels, which does not suit the game. Choices from past games are well implemented in the way that characters respond to them, however, it is dissapointing that many past choices result in the same outcomes in this game. Mass Effect 3 also introduces multiplayer, which is very unneccesary. This is your typical Gears of War Horde mode clone, only it doesn't work as well and becomes boring after a while. It doesn\\\'t help that you have to play it in order to unlock the best endings possible. Mass Effect is best suited as a single-player experience, and should have remained one. The ending of the game is emotional and clever, but it doesn't give you that epic conclusion that you would expect after such a long journey. Don't expect moments as moving and pumping as Shephard's speech during the finale of ME2. The biggest dissapointment here is that none of your previous choices really affect that ending, and that you have to play multiplayer to get the perfect variable. The inclusion of day-one dlc also drags the game down, especially since the character and his tale included are much needed to understand the story and universe. Overall this game is an emotional experience that improves upon gameplay, but one that doesn't quite reach the heights of the previous games in terms of story and characters. Multiplayer shouldn't exist and the DLC should just have been a part of the game. The ending could have used more time and doesn't quite leave you with a satisfying conclusion as it should do after three games. Choices, both past and new, should have more impact as they did in previous games. Despite these isses, ME3 is an emotional and ambitious game that will likely hook you from beginning to end. If you are a hardcore ME fan, chances are you will be dissapoint",8,2012-10-04,XBOX 360,user

But guys forget about those last 15 Minutes, think of the fun you had with this game before those last 15 minutes, great gameplay, story and many other great things.

StripestheZebra,"Really, Mass Effect 3 just rocks. If you enjoyed the previous 2 even a little, be prepared to be amazed. It kind of melds the best elements of Mass Effect with the vibrancy and life of Mass Effect 2, which was easily the game of the year back in 2010.

Philip261,"To say Mass Effect 3 is a bad game is completely wrong, it gets some things that it shouldn't wrong but these cloud over the positives, I will lay this out so it is easier to read, I will leave the multiplayer out for the moment. POSITIVE - The combat is an improvement on Mass Effect 2, it is much more fluid and enjoyable. -The story (up until the final 20 minutes) is pretty good -The weapon choice is nearly as large as ME1 but all the guns are different and offer great variety -Set pieces are great NEGATIVE - The ending, although not as bad as some claim (now thanks to the extended cut free DLC it makes sense), it also leaves room for Bioware to implement the ""Indoctrination Theory"" (For more info go to Clever Noob Network on YouTube, they have 3 hour and a half documentries on this concept) -Some of the animations are poor, (Shepard often does a shoulder pat that looks like it's from the 90s - There are also marks that the game was rushed, e.g on mission one on Earth, when on the **** look down, the images of husks running below you looks terrible) -The combat, though very well polished is a little too easy, the ability to unleash ridiculously powerful explosions with biotics makes insanity really too easy in parts. -I found the fact that you can't go into true conversation with squadmates on the Normandy anytime a tad annoying but then again the banter that is thrown between them better them more than makes up for it STORY OVER MULTIPLAYER Without multiplayer I would have probably given this game a 6 or 7 It is the better part of the game and has very few flaws, for those who don't know the multiplayer is a horde mode (wave defence) with 11 rounds, however at 3,6 and 10 there is an objective to complete, this earns you credits to buy equipment. The 11th wave is an extraction wave where you have to survive for two mins and get to an extraction zone. You can play as a many different races and classes, there are lots of maps and you can fight Cerberus, geth or Reapers on either bronze (easy), Silver (normal) or Gold (hard), the number of credits increases the harder difficulty, they added a platinum difficulty in a free dlc where you fight all the factions at once who are at full strength at wave one. The multiplayer has been attacked by some critics but is actually incredible and adds huge replay value to the game For those interested I played Mass Effect 2 first, it was so well reviewed I felt compelled to play it. I then got Mass Effect 3 and earlier this year I got Mass Effect 1. So no I am not a ""true"" fan of the series but given i put 40 hours into ME3 within a week of owning it and am probably well past 200 hours of total play time on ME3 alone, I feel I am qualified to judge this game, unlike those who just played the game once and stopped playing due to the ending.",9,2012-09-19,XBOX 360,user
martinmiggs,"Great game, and one of the best (if not the best) trilogies in gaming. I just wanted to add my two cents as there are some very strange reviews on Metacritic. I found that the choices I made throughout the series hugely satisfactory down the line. I also feel the ending was great. You can achieve the ""best"" ending without jumping through any or the peripheral hoops EA set up. The aforementioned ending has emotional weight and payoff. Brilliant.

Necrotaur,"I score reviews based on how I feel about the game after finishing it, and it is very, very difficult to see past the terrible ending, multiple plot holes, and the utterly stupid ""big reveal"" of the Reaper's motives in Mass Effect 3. The ending, coupled with the Day 1 DLC (which is wrong no matter how you spin it) really leaves a bad taste in my mouth. The way it's presented makes no sense whatsoever and runs completely counter to the idea that your choices throughout the game matter. The ME series spans 5+ years of generally excellent media, and for it to end in a three way deus ex machina like it did is just mind blowing. It **** saying that, because the 90% of the game leading up to the end is really, really good, even if it played more like a 'best of' compilation than a completely new game. A quick note about the multiplayer: it's *kind of* good, but in other ways it's really, really bad. Gameplay wise it's a fun (if overpowered), Halo-esque shooter, but the community is beyond terrible, kicking players who are just starting out or have a low N7 score, and verbally berating those who either do too well or too poorly. Also, based on what happened to Mercenaries 2 when EA shut down it's servers, I have little hope for the future of ME3.",3,2012-09-09,XBOX 360,user
dosmax,"Despite what people have said about the ending, I thought it was an epic close to an epic series. This game marks that Shepard's story is at an end and that's exactly what the ending accomplishes. The unmarked side missions are my biggest complaint and I still didn't find them too annoying because if you just walked around you would easily acquire them and complete them. The game play was the smoothest of the series and the graphics were great. There were moments that made you want to jump up in anger and in joy as well as moments that drew a tear. It was a beautiful story, and I think it was an amazing ending for one of the best series ever produced.",10,2012-09-04,XBOX 360,user
M3ta,"The gameplay (i.e. combat) is good. The graphics are amazing. The presentation and story is bad. Sidequests involve either flying somewhere and shooting Cerberus people in a combat zone, or using the Galaxy map to scan planets. That's it - scan planets. You don't actually VISIT the planets, you just scan them, which allows to to magically recover artifacts, and rescue entire races. By pressing the scan button. These sidequests are picked up by eavesdropping on people's conversations in the Citadel (which, by the way, is the ONLY hub in the entire game... funny how everyone wants to meet you on the Citadel - there's nowhere else to go). ""Hey dude, heard you talking on the phone to your buddy, saying you needed an antidote to a Reaper poison... I just happened to travel to a planet, and bring you back the antidote... here ya go."" ""Orly? Thats... awfully convenient... thanks?"" You do get to meet your allies from Mass Effect 2, but it's more like ""Oh hey Grunt/ Samara/ Jacob, how're things? What's that, you'd like me to kill some stuff for you? Sure. OK, we've killed all the stuff... guess I'll catch you later."" It is nice to see how small decisions from ME1/2 played out, but you only really get to see it in small ways, like extranet messages. And finally, the ending seems to have been written by someone with no grasp of concepts like ""logic"", and is probably the most unsatisfying experience I've ever had with a franchise I used to love. Oh, and the DLC? With ME2, DLC like Shadow Broker was great since it added to the game and expanded on the universe and the characters - this Leviathan DLC is basically pointless for people who have finished the game. In short, the game looks great, but really disappoints - the polar oppoosite to the game that started it off, the first Mass Effect.",6,2012-08-31,XBOX 360,user

StapledYeti,"Mass effect has always been a series that has been a benchmark for sic-fi role playing games since it was released and with the latest instalment i can't see that changing any time soon. People slate it because they didn't get the ending they wanted or that Bioware changed the game in a way that reaches out to a richer audience, those aren't reasons to give a game a low mark in my opinion. I believe Bioware did everything perfectly except for a few minor problems. The first of which is that the game world restricts you a lot, you can't really venture anywhere whilst on a mission, this problem has been in the franchise all along and all i wished for was for that to change for this instalment. Its more of a insignificant annoyance than a problem to be honest. Another qualm i have is that the romance is still as stiff and awkward as ever, i found in mass effect that if i ran to the person i found most attractive after every mission to merely talk to them for two minutes they would eventually and consensual sex with me, this was both amusing and irritating to me and simply wasted my time. My final problem i see in the game is that the dialogue is a little bit... well... crap. In mass effect 1 and 2 the dialogue was both engrossing and interesting as what people said actually made a difference most of the time. This time round though you'll find yourself talking to people for no visible reason other than to yet again fill them game with time consuming conversation about matters that I'm sure the supposed saviour of the galaxy really shouldn't give damn about. I also need to mention the ending of the game which really does seem to be irritating people doesn't it! But seriously i see no problem with it, it wraps the game up nicely and gives the player a real emotional reaction, if this wasn't the case for you then lets just agree to disagree to you. Now as for the good points, i could sit here all day and tell you how the game is vastly improved on its predecessor, first of the combat both melee and ranged is vastly improved, i really enjoyed trying out different weapons i either bought or unlocked throughout the game and the ways they could be used, it was a fulfilling way to spend my space money. This is the same for armour unlocks and etc. The only problem with the armour is that some times they looked far too similar and that you could only buy full suits of a certain type if lets say you only wanted the helmet. Other than that making yourself look badass was pretty fun and indulging. Another point is also that the story is both brilliant and emotional, at some points it really hits home whats actually happening and at others it keeps you engrossed to the point where you'll not want t stop playing as you want to find out what happens next. My final point is going to be that the characters are just as interesting and boring as ever, some like garrus will keep you laughing and others will make you wish the conversation would hurry up but the most important thing is that Bioware have done a brilliant job in rounding off the relationships you have built with your crew members and how you come to terms with them before you set out on your final mission. Overall then this game is brilliant with just a few problems which i have outlined, these shouldn't keep you from playing it and enjoying the ride just as much as i did.",9,2012-08-27,XBOX 360,user
Wiffyjustus,"The journey over all three games was fantastic. The destination ****. I loved this game, until I got to the end. I respect Bioware's adherence to their 'artistic vision', but I whole-heartedly disagree with it. The endings felt like a spit in the face to all the hours invested in this series by the consumer. It must be worse for those who worked tirelessly on this series to see such negative fan reaction. Sadly, I believe the negative reaction is warranted.",1,2012-08-27,XBOX 360,user

TheShakyMatty,"Mass Effect 3 is a journey that tugs at heart strings, makes you ask big questions and ends multiple story archs. The Mass Effect trilogy has been phenomenal, and has excelled in scope and story telling although the illusion of choice is ever present. While I invested my time in Mass Effect 3 it soon became clear that the game was telling an end of the story from the very beginning. This is how I suggest you treat the **** multiplayer is a fun edition and greatly expands the life of the product it was not somthing I asked for but fun regardless. It is not without fault so i cannot in good conscience give it a amazing score cause it is not. These faults are very minor and do not subtract from the game very much i.e. Trouble finding quest related people on map, lackluster epilogue, your choices do not feel as important as it could be and multiplayer connection problems. The game is great overall and deserves a 7/10 I recommend you buy it, you could do a lot worse.",7,2012-08-16,XBOX 360,user
ulysees33,"A fantastic game. It increases the stakes on every level and raises the bar for gaming. Taken as a trilogy it's a major achievement and unlikely to be superseded any time soon. When you factor in the different choices and outcomes, and the male / female, hetero / ****, renegade / paragon options, it's obvious that the games places an outstanding amount of flexibility in the player's hands to craft their own experience while still managing to tell a coherent and meaningful narrative that is genuinely moving. There may be specific features of the action, role play, art direction or story that aren't to everyone's taste - it's impossible to please everyone all the time - but to give this game anything less than a very positive review is simply nuts. As for the ending (s), I found it deeply satisfying. Rarely has a game franchise had such an impact on me - Final Fantasy or Metal Gear Solid are the only equivalents that come readily to mind. Plus a very good multiplayer, add on content and mobile content as well...! To make an original universe that is so ambitious and achieve so much seems genuinely unprecedented and puts gaming at the forefront of creative media. The only equivalent in movies at the moment would be the Nolan Batman films but I would say that even they pale in comparison. Bring on the DLC.",10,2012-08-14,XBOX 360,user
OverLordLuigi,"This game is some of the worst work Bioware has done. For a game focused on decision making, there isn't that many decisions in most cases you are only granted 2 options that are obviously Renegade or Paragon choices and nothing neutral. Very rarely do you even get a 3rd option in dialogue. There are also less RPG elements than before making this game more of a 3rd person shooter than an RPG. The new squad members were not nearly as interesting as the previous ones. Finally the two worst parts the ending which the extended cut did not fix that well you, just get a 5 minute slideshow and of course **** day 1 DLC .",4,2012-08-12,XBOX 360,user
Snipestrifer,"Okay, NOW I realize why people would be disappointed, though I disagree with those saying the game is god awful. Yes, EA monetized the crap out of this game, but that's no where the game fails, that's just bad business practice of the publisher funding the game's development. First, the positives. The combat has been refined and is pretty much as good as it can get at this point, although the new weight system hits infiltrators and non-power based classes REALLY hard. So I have to pick between having all my guns and almost never being able to use Adrenaline Rush now? That's stupid! (Wow, this got negative fast). That negative aside, the AI has been improved and enemy variety and behaviour has improved significantly, it's just slightly irritating most of the time it's cerberus and not the Reapers you're fighting (How did Cerberus build an army of millions in barely half a year, when they're known as a terrorist organisation?). Weapon modding is back and now it also has a visual effect as well as a gameplay effect, which is cool. It's not as deep as ME1's weapon modding system, but it spares us of that horrible inventory system and combined with ammo powers it integrates very well into the gameplay. Also, we get more gun variety and armour variety, which is always a good thing. So essentially combat is much better than before, so why is this game only a 7? It's Mass Effect! It should like a 9 or a 10, right? Well, unfortunately here are many negatives that hold this game back. The intro is boring and sloppy, especially compared to ME2. The reason is one, no dramatic opening and two, a crap ton of auto-dialogue (I'll be getting to that in a minute, believe me). As I'm re-familiarizing myself with the game mechanics I can't get invested into the story because in order to get invested into the story I must have reasonable knowledge of the game mechanics. Placing a major plot point at the time of a tutorial is probably the worst thing you can do with the intro. ME2 did this right, where I only had to run and move the camera in a controlled environment, so I could get invested in the story. The more advanced mechanics were saved for later when nothing as important was happening. The next negative is auto-dialogue, and it's over abundance. WHY? WHY WOULD YOU PUT IN LOADS OF AUTO-DIALOGUE IN A GAME BASED AROUND DIALOGUE CHOICES? That makes NO sense and just robs the player of the feeling that their Shepard is really theirs, and destroys immersion and the freedom the player previously experienced. The next negative is the abandonning of the build-up of ME1 and ME2, specifically Harbinger and the Dark matter plot. For those that don't know, ME3 was supposed to have a plot that revolved around dark matter but was abandoned for the whole ""Synthetic vs Organic"" thing. This leaves returning players confused as to what's going on and de-means the previous games. Not good. As for Harbinger, he was clearly set-up as the main villain in ME2, why reduce him to a glorified heavy hitter at the end? WHY? Everyone was looking forward to confronting the Harbinger why rob us of that? More abandonning of the build-up of the previous games. So second from last we have the problem that the story itself is more linear and interrupts and dialogue choices don't affect a conversation like they used to. They are generally just there for flavour and that's it now, which a shame considering how genius interrupts were as a concept and how well ME2 did them. And now to everyones favourite part, the ending. Where to begin... Well, even with the EC (Extended cut) it makes ZERO sense, and completely contradicts the themes of the Mass Effect franchise. It's disgusting. Your choices don't matter (As if EMS made your choices matter anyway LOL) apart from this one final choice and they don't even commit to Shepard dying. The EC provides the bare minimum character closure required and closes a few plotholes but it ends up trading them for more plotholes so it really is not much better and the character closure has been done before and BETTER with Dragon Age: Origins. Now THAT was an ending. This game is still very solid and enjoyable even if it is has some serious flaws. It still has those ""Magic Mass Effect"" moments, and the characters are as cool and well-written as ever (Apart from Vega) with their arcs coming full circle now, but compared to the other two ME games it doesn't even come close to reaching their levels of greatness. There are other complaints, such as the shafting of the ME2 cast, and a lot of fridge logic moments, and the fetch quests, but I could keep going for hours. All you need to know is this game is solid, but if you were expecting an amazing finale, prepare to be disappointed.",7,2012-08-09,XBOX 360,user

LostRiot,"As seen in many reviews, I am a huge fan of the series, but this one I had some personal feelings about. I really love the story and all the character structure. I enjoy the new features and the fact that they brought back some of the customizing features from the first game. Now the fact that I really don't play RPG games often because they are a challenge if they attempt to be like shooters, but Mass Effect was amazing in story and character customizing that I saw past the not so smooth play of the shooter mechanics. The second Mass Effect streamed lined them enough but did sacrifice RPG play. The third I felt focused to much on making this play like Gears of War and lost the fun challenge of an ""RPG shooter"" that made it different and original. Now for the story. Drop the Indoctrination Theory Issues, why did you do everything you did in he game not to see some resolution to each of the allied factions you earned through the entire game. I felt skimped. I don't blame Bioware so much as I blame EA. EA has to be the worst at putting a deadline on games and ruining the creativity that the developers need to make quality.

EnigmaReviews,"Well one of the best gaming series ever has come to an end. When I first got my hands on the game I immediatly notices differences from the second game.

This is good because in a lot of sequels devs will recycle the same animation. I got to the story and it was extremely good no suprise there. The gameplay was great, weapons where awesome, and the characters where likeable. The multiplayer isn't that great to be honest. It seem like something they tacked on to add more to the game. Although the free DLC is a bonus it isn't much of a plus. Now here comes the ending drama. (Please note that I am writng this review after the extended cut dlc). This part of the game has gathered a lot of negative feedback. The ending by far was good. The main thing I have a problem with is what Bioware promised. The ending didn't have much variety in them. Also your decisions really don't have zero effect on the ending as well which is a huge let down. Overall this is an amazing game but if you where a fan from the begining them you will feel disapointed at the end. That doesn't take away from the game though. It does so much good that it heavily out weighs the bad. Mass Effect 3 is a 9/10 if they would have got the ending right it would have been a master piece.",9,2012-07-24,XBOX 360,user
NateStC,"While the story, voice acting, and cinematics may be great, it still doesn't make up for the fact that as a game it is horrible. In ME2 they went for a more tactical combat approach and it worked. This time they tried to throw in some Gears of War style faced paced action into the combat and it completely screwed everything up. Every battle field is littered with cover that your character gets on the wrong side of half the time, and there is so much debris it makes it nearly impossible to navigate, even outside of combat. To make things even more difficult, the controls are clunky, making it even further difficult to move anywhere. Another thing that ruined the tactical combat is that in half of the combat scenarios, you have enemies flanking simultaneously from literally every direction, making it nearly impossible to stay alive even on the easier combat settings. Every single combat situation is nothing more than a clusterf***. There are tons of side missions, which I love! But alas, they screwed that up as well. There is so much dialogue it is impossible to keep track and even decipher all the tasks you're given. The mission journal offers little to no information on objectives, and don't ever update as you progress. This is an incredibly disappointing game. Were I to hold it up against the other games in this franchise, I'd have to give it a 1 out of 10. But to be fair I've graded it on it's own, not up to the hype or expected greatness Bioware commands. Ultimately the game feels unfinished. They focused so much on the dialogue and story it feels like they only got half way through testing the actual gameplay then shipped it to market. I can't imagine it is even fixable through patch. Shame on you EA and Bioware for such a pathetic display.",3,2012-07-24,XBOX 360,user
Hugh5031,"Mass Effect 3 is a great game, that I believe is wrongfully hated on. The reason for this is simple, it changed genres. While the first game was a fully-fledged RPG, the combat mechanics in the first game were sloppy, and in the next game gameplay was vastly improved, but RPG elements were toned down. This left hardcore RPG fans unhappy, This third game definitely has the best gameplay in the series, for the overpowered particle rifle to the addictive Scorpion, but less RPG elements than ever before. Don't let this fool you though, the story is as good as ever, with some truly awesome moments and payoffs, a surprisingly good multiplayer, and plenty of visits from old characters. I would highly recommend playing the series the whole way through, but don't expect the RPG experience in each game, but come in expecting in this third game an awesome action game with RPG elements. Also, the ending wasn't one i particularly liked, but didn't detract as much from the game as the vocal minority say, especially with the extended cut endings. Free DLC in this game is awesome, considering it is an EA game. Overall, I'd rate this game a clean 9.5 and definitely recommend the series to anyone looking for an awesome story that they'll remember for years to come.",0,2012-07-23,XBOX 360,user
thebrock,"Surprised by the user score. However I have never seen the original ending which apparently was shocking. To start with the positives graphics where excellent, gameplay was great . One thing that really annoyed me was if you imported your character from ma1 and ma2 you started at level 30 with the majority of your abilities not far from being maxed out. Not much of a challenge in that. Overall i feel that with the revised ending mass effect 3 was a fantastic game. Good ending to the trilogy. All in all i would say the best trilogy of games that have been released in gaming history. A must play game for rpg fans.",9,2012-07-22,XBOX 360,user

tmbrwlf,"The game started off a little disconnected if you haven't played the ME2 DLC's but you quickly get into it. The build up of the story takes off quite quickly and its easy to get into the gameplay and the story. Originally there were a lot of gaps, but the release of the free DLC plugs these and finishes it off nicely. If the DLC ending and gaps had been in the original this would've had a 9 easily. There are a few things missing for it to make a 10.",8,2012-07-17,XBOX 360,user
AnonXD,"Mass Effect 3... I patiently waited to play you, holding back my urge to play demo's and watch gameplay so that this final experience would be special. And it was very special, until the end. Gameplay and combat wise, Mass Effect 3 absolutely excels. I had a blast playing through all of the missions and it scores a 9.5 here. As for the plot (before the end), It was solid but they could have worked a lot more of the intricacies developed early in the series into this final story, it scores an 8.5 here. The end... oh the disappointing end. Even after the director's cut extended ending, I found myself saying ""why Bioware?"" Essentially, they added a insipid slideshow recapping what you just accomplished, that's all. This ending to my favorite sci-fi trilogy nearly **** my love of the games. This ending scores a 2. Mass Effect 3 was supposed to end it all, and end it well. I would have taken sub-par gameplay and no multiplayer in a heartbeat for at least a decent ending.",5,2012-07-17,XBOX 360,user

mgyukeri,"While the ending to the epic trilogy caused probably the largest controversy a game release has ever had, Mass Effect 3 is a perfect game. At least until the last 15 minutes. Let me just say I have not played the ""Extended Cut DLC"", not have I seen the new endings on YouTube. My opinion is only on the physical release of the game, not its content. Mass Effect 3 delivers an emotional ****. With cameos from the original games and an epic story, Mass Effect 3 seems like the ending to a TV show you really love. I found myself crying more than once because of events that occurred. Look, the ending might turn you off, but the entire experience is only slightly marred.

Udead4,"Overall the game was very disappointing for me, and this is sad because I have played the other 2 ME games and consider myself a Mass Effect fan (maybe it should be considered). A few parts were very well done and this is what made the game bearable for me. The Tuchanka and Rannoch mission chains were the games saving grace and the writing was in most cases stellar. Which makes the debacle at the end of the game even harder to understand. The ending was nothing short of a travesty. It took away my desire to replay the game and even the other two games. When a game does that I would consider a 4 a very generous score...",4,2012-07-08,XBOX 360,user

ClockworkSpec,"I looked forward to this game with a lot of anticipation. I got nervous about it when I played the demo, and unfortunately it was a sign of what the actual game was going the be like. Bioware/EA really phoned it in in much of this game and particularly in the ending, even after the EC DLC. They failed to match many of the premisses they made for content and atmosphere in the game. The original ME was amazing and by far the best of the three games, EA is a slow acting poison killing Bioware, it is really a shame. If it were not for a few moments in the game that actually felt genuine and thought through I would be giving this game a zero.",3,2012-07-07,XBOX 360,user

maltizar,"Okay... if you hadn't noticed, playing this game, you'll either love it and be annoyed by the people that hate it or love it and hate the game and be annoyed by the people who love it. One of the major requirements is the experience of the previous two games which means it's not all that great of a stand alone game. The ending is not for everybody, so even if you did play the previous games, there's no guarantee you'll like it. The story is disjointed. There are game aspects that those who played the previous games won't understand because they didn't read the books or they didn't read the comics and even that's not going to mean you're going to like it. Gameplay is the greatest improvement. There are better games with better controls, but it's obviously the biggest improvement. That said, it lacks gaming systems like minigames, quality side missions and boss battles. It's like it's a game designed by people who wished they were writing a novel instead of making a game. It's a space RPG with no exploration. It's a bland shooter that doesn't revolutionize anything whose targeting systemyou either like or don't.. It's a ""choose your own adventure"" with limited choices. It's a space sci fi space opera that fails to live up to the greats. I was going to give it a 5, then I remembered that you have to download a different ending because the first one was really bad instead of disjointed and contrived. You also have to pay for a downloadable 7th character. To unlock the all the endings, you have to either download the Extended cut or play multiplayer to unlock the endings just on the disc. Some of the plots, you have to play the previous games. They're better, so going back to play another game to play this one seem pointless considering it doesn't matter in terms of resolution. If you do play those games, you end up playing better quality games not restricted by a badly timeline. Storywise, the resolution is seperate from the rest of the series, which is a shame because the rest of it was pretty darn good. I'd say, save your money. If you haven't played it by now, you'd have a better time playing one of the first 2 games. It'll be in the used game pile soon, anyway.",1,2012-07-03,XBOX 360,user
DetectiveEyes,"Mass Effect 3 starts some time after the 2nd one ended. You are given the choice to go with the Role-play perspective of the game, with little combat throughout the game, or you can choose to go with the action perspective of the game with little Role-play and dialog, and more of the shooting and blowing stuff up. At the beginning it took me a moment to actually grasp what was happening but eventually it became pretty clear. Almost instantly you are given a gun and told to kill all the aliens in your path. Pretty soon after, you are given the choice to be nice and understanding of your friend or to be a complete jerk to him and tell to **** it up and fight. Then there's the whole decision making standpoint of the game, where you choose to do the right thing, or to do the wrong thing. Now for the problems, there's an equal amount of pros as there are cons in this game. The good parts of the game would definitely be its engaging storyline. However its bad counterpart is the 3 endings you are faced with. I wont get very deep into spoiler and whatnot, but the endings are all bad, and look like they were halfway done in order to make the Mass Effect 3 release date. The ending completely has nothing to do with everything you have done in the story whatsoever. However there is still hope. The game still had its relationship aspect where people could be your friends, your enemies, or your lover. Without the game you can alter the relationship at almost anytime, as you can talk to almost anybody, at any time. The game still has its aspect of freedom, to a certain point at least. Another problem with the game is the dialog system. When you are talking to somebody your facial, and body movements are not the most realistic. As with the person you are talking to. But I think most people would have to understand that the game would have come out sometime is early May or late April if the facial expressions were better than they are now. And it could have released sometime in June if they made the endings better. Overall this game is, in my opinion, worth the 60 dollars to pay for it, and also has some very nice sex scenes in it.",7,2012-07-02,XBOX 360,user
Tubey,"Here's the problem - Mass Effect is a magnificent series; but I can't recommend ME3 as a 10/10 game, or even anywhere close. The problem with it for me isn't really the ending (yes, it's true, it was unbelievably bad), but rather the fact it should be renamed ""Gears of Modern Battlefield 5"". I honestly don't class ME3 as an RPG; rather, it's an on the rails mediocre shooter, interspersed with a lot of cut scenes and dialogue, which is again on the rails. Even if you are a big fan, go back and think about it - you are treated to a lot of dialogue, you make choices etc. but no matter what you choose you move forward to the very same portion of the game as everyone else - you shoot stuff and run through corridors. I didn't feel like I was ""role playing"" as Shephard, unless you consider Call of Duty an RPG as well! Unlike ME 1 & 2, I felt very little for the plight of Shephard because throughout the game the overall writing is a bit sub-par compared to previous games. This is, in my opinion, symptomatic of the problems at Bioware at the moment; style over substance. It was like after two superb games I was being abandoned as a fan in favour of commercial appeal above and beyond anything else. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a ""bad"" game; you'd have to be completely out of your mind to say that ME3 is anything other than decent as a total package. But - and it's a big but - it's nowhere near the perfect game and in relation to the franchise it takes a giant turd on what has gone before. So it's bizarre to sum it up in this way, but there's no other way to put it - if you're a Call of Duty fan, looking for a more ""in depth"" game without sacrificing the mindless shoot 'em up FPS experience, then Mass Effect 3 is for you. However, if you're a fan of Mass Effect 1 & 2, then this game may very well disappoint you. At the very least, if you play this game, switch it off as soon as you see a glowing holographic image of a child - you'll thank me for doing so. So yes, I'd be wrong to score it any less than 7/10, but what I will say is that after the debacle that was Dragon Age 2 and now the less than stellar Mass Effect trilogy conclusion, I will be careful to spend money on a product bearing the Bioware logo, simply because the once accepted measure of excellence they held in a gamers heart has been lost. Let's hope a return to form is just around the corner.",7,2012-07-02,XBOX 360,user
JamesBondHero,"First, to get it clear, all the reviews that gave ME3 a 0 or 1 are just... can't use profanity... there's no way a game could get a score like that. The only problem that made Mass Effect 3 get bad reviews from just ""fans"" is because of the endings. Now the Extended Cut, a free DLC, fixes probably more than half of the issues, including the bad ones, making the ending a satisfying and sad end to the best video game trilogy ever created. The game has minor flaws: glitches, and awkward moments but not game breaking. The game has everything: fun, epic moments, love, care, role playing, action, adventure, heart pumping moments. Not buying this game would be a HUGE mistake, except if you never played the previous Mass Effect games, which are masterpieces. Maybe I make Mass Effect sound overrated, but the best thing about it, is that ME3 is that good. A simple art masterpiece. But it isn't perfect of course, the game could have been improved with more content, as it lacks of appealing side quests. The side quests (optional assignments) are unnecessary and too the point of boredom, but as I said: optional so I won't add it to my score. It is worth your money and none should be disappointed now, as the end has been fixed. Do not even judge by the extremely negative user reviews. I would tell you to trust the critics on this one, even they ignored the original ending, now, forgettable as Extended Cut is out, at no extra cost.",10,2012-07-02,XBOX 360,user

Also if Bioware was going to make a genuine effort to appease fans of the series surely they could have provided a few more endings with the possibility of happier conclusion, It is after all a fantasy/sci fi game and not based on reality.

Vehement,"Hate ME3 with a passion. I swallowed ME2 because the non-existing storyline was compensated by great characters (Mordin, Garrus, Thane, Samara, Illusive Man). All the major characters in ME2 are irrelevant to ME3, because all but one becomes brief, un-join-able NPCs and their deaths are inconsequential to the story. While Tali returns as playable, her role is moot in the storyline. What is worst is that all the new team members are bland. The Collector story from ME2 is pointless other than vaguely explaining indoctrination and introducing the Illusive Man, who goes from a major protagonist to antagonist in ME2 to a side character in ME3. He even went from a racist to a racist who turn himself to another race. Ironic? Bioware ripped out the great character developments in ME3 and left us with a bad story. ""Hey guys! I found something that looks like a blueprint to something. It might be a weapon but we don't know. This blueprint is from a race that was wiped out by the very entities threatening us, so we should gamble and put the entire galaxy's resource into building it!."" WORST PREMISE EVER! The details of the device should have been placed before the making than after the making of the device!!! What the hell was Shepard doing for the past 6months or a year between ME2 and ME3?

chris23433,"Mass Effect 3, the epic finale to one of best sci fi trilogies created. The finale though, completely ruins what was one of the best series ever. It's not just the ending. Although yes the ending destroys all semblance of immersion, canon, good story telling, and much more, it's not only the ending that makes Mass Effect 3 a terrible conclusion. First off, the gameplay or lack thereof. The conversations are nothing like they used to be in the previous two. Whereas in the previous two you could input Shepard's descisions on the tiniest of choices, in Mass Effect 3 it's almost gone. You make some dialougue choices throughout the game, but most of the choices are made for you (I was playing on rpg mode by the way.) The quests are mainly filler consisting boring fetch quests. Although the side missions that are playable and have you on the ground are quite alot of fun to play and are the best moments in the game. Oh, and my final gripe the multiplayer. The online although alot of fun, SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN NECESSARY TO OBTAIN THE BEST ENDING IN THE SINGLEPLAYER. I remember hearing one of the developers at Bioware talk about how the multiplayer could impact the finale, but wouldn't be necessary to obtain the best ending. What happened to that? What happened to the various amounts of endings? What happened to amazing choices? What happened to Mass Effect? I don't know to be honest, but it's quite sad to see what was one of the best series in gaming from one of the most talented developers in the industry, deliver a product this... dissapointing. I remember playing the first Kotor and the first Mass Effect games, and being amazed at the amount of choices I could make, and the impact I had on the characters. Hell, in the original Kotor towards the end you could completely turn on your old squadmates and reclaim your title as Lord of the Sith with the aide of one of your former crewmates/love interest. In the original Mass Effect if you played it right you could convince of one the main villians to kill himself in order to help the galaxy. This, though is not the Bioware of Kotor or ME1. In ME3 none of your choices throughout the entire series matter when it comes to the ending. None. All you get are three different **** color explosions with the same exact pros and cons regardles of what you choose. This game was horrid. Perhaps, the ending dlc Bioware is making shall remedy the ending. Even if it does though, the dissapointment I felt while playing through Mass Effect 3 and viewing its ending shall not. I have lost a great amount of faith in Bioware as a good developer. It's sad to see what could've the most epic conclusion in gaming go so poorly.",1,2012-06-14,XBOX 360,user
Sandrick,"The ratings separation over this game tells you where the critics allegiances lie... ALL POSITIVE REVIEWS???? Give me a break - even if the ending would have been fantastic, there were still a lot of issues with the game. My biggest issue is that Mass Effect is a game of choices that all lead up to different outcomes. Both of the first games had them and that was what fans came to expect. The fact that this one opted for the easy, tacked on ending just shows how rushed it was. So sad to see a stellar franchise end on such a tragic note, sacrificing creativity and quality in the face of corporate greed. It wasn't even just about the story of the ending. There is a scene where Shepard and Anderson are supposed to be looking out at a view of Earth and Anderson says ""what a view"" and it is literally the WORST low resolution bitmap image that I have ever seen in a game. In the ending sequence... How is that not rushed and a slap in the face to all of the people who gave them their money and trust. I truly feel sorry for the employees that worked on Mass Effect 3, knowing that it was such a bomb ****. They likely wanted to speak up, but like many people in this economy, didn't jeopardize their jobs. Well, they have to live with that now - It probably won't be the first thing that they mention when someone asks what they worked on... Then, looking at the user reviews, you see a very different picture. Split right down the middle, with an incredible amount of negative reviews. I wonder if EA employs a division to write positive reviews to offset this.",4,2012-06-14,XBOX 360,user
Cuddlezombie,"I know that this score my seem harsh to some of the hardcore Mass Effect gamers out there, but i was so disappointed with Mass Effect 3 that in my opinion it doesn't deserve a better rating. I have way to many complaints to list here, but the things that really annoy me about this game are simple. Bioware have gone from ripping of other sci-fi tv shows, games, books etc to ripping of Gears of War and badly at that. Also, why do they feel the need to do a Dragon Age 2 and overly sexualize the characters. For a female gamers such as myself, I dont need to see Miranda's bum when I am having a conversation and dont want to play a game that degrades women. Therefore I have marked Mass Effect 3 down from the score I gave it and was highly disappionted as I like the other Mass Effect games.",0,2012-06-12,XBOX 360,user
Vertillian,"Before anyone calls me a ""troll"" for giving this game a zero, allow me to explain. Originally I thought this game deserved a 5/10. I found about half the content enjoyable, if a little bland. The music was lacking in atmosphere, the dialogue is ropey and the graphics buggy! (my characters head revolved like an excorcist moment!) Then came the gameplay, removed almost completely from anything remotely RPG and lacking depth. The A.I are atrocious, constantly glitching through walls and running backwards into enemies. Despite this, I was enjoying an average 5/10 game. Then came the release day content that was included on the disc, pointless multiplayer, ridiculous flirting for no reason, massively boring sections of corridor shooting monotony, and the fact I had to swap disc four times within 40mins!!! This is yet another over-hyped and over-rated lazy effort from bioware. I waited and only paid Â£15 for it and still felt cheated. If this is the supposed ""natural evolution of the RPG"" I worry for the future of decent, in depth games. My last grievance, that really dropped the score, was the blatant copying of Gears Of War. The cover system I can accept, but now add roady-running, rolls, jumps and melee. Also now a hammer of dawn impression! Give it a rest Bioware and get your own ideas.",0,2012-06-12,XBOX 360,user
niketnb,"There have many reviews about this game, and most of them are commenting about the poor ending of this game. But I think this game is definite a worth to buy game, the reason because of the multi-player. How the graphics were superb with a very dandy covering system, going through every corners, sprinting and cover from enemies firing. There just had many ways to play your own style of game, with a lot of selection of characters and using different abilities. On the other hand, limited maps and difficulty were the main problem in multiplayer which lower the score. For professional gamers, I think gold challenge was a bit too easy due to the fact that there were too much ways to play this game, entertaining with communicating with four players. Moreover, multiplayer only have 5-6 maps weren't enough to last the gameplay long, which only for maximum 1 month or so. Increasing the varies or mods in multiplayer can improve the overall rating since that the single player's ending was weak. Overall, I think this game's selling was just for multiplayer, if gamers were just waiting for the single player, this game won't be your choice.",5,2012-06-11,XBOX 360,user
DETHREAPER,"The most brilliant game to be made yet. The story lived up to, and even set the bar higher for what a science fiction story could do. The perfect mix of philosophy, analytical thought, and emotion present created something no other story has been able to achieve, and that is perfection. To be fair, video games aren't just about story, no matter the level of brilliance, but gameplay also. That being said, Mass Effect 3 is a paradigm of an RPG shooter, which again, set the bar higher for others. On another note, I was a bit leery about the soundtrack when I heard that Jack Wall was leaving, but as soon as I heard what Clint Mansell had to present, my fears were assuaged; as usual, he has masterfully orchestrated pieces that contribute to mood and emotion, while sticking to the roots of the series' sound. With Mass Effect 3, there is literally nothing I can think of that could be improved or changed, as perfection cannot be improved upon any further.",10,2012-06-10,XBOX 360,user

BeatrixKiddo27,"Mass Effect was my favorite game series ever. I was a huge fan on Bioware, owning almost all of their games. Mass Effect 2 is my favorite game of all time. I was so excited for the ending to the planned space opera trilogy, and for the most part, it was amazing. Throughout the entire game, I was in awe of the amazing scenes played out. This game was larger than anything before in the series, and you face some of the biggest intergalactic issues, such as the Geth & Quarian war. The gameplay is tighter, the character interaction great, 95% of this game is a masterpiece. Then you reach the infamous ending. This ending ruined everything, this game, and the trilogy as a whole. It is somewhat amazing that in 10 minutes, Bioware is able to destroy a series. When you think Mass Effect, you think player choice and impact. This ending takes that all away, and makes literally every choice you made prior pointless. Rather than give an ending that made sense, one that was hinted at by the games, they decided to try to transcend the game into an artistic statement. Instead they created plot holes, and divided their fanbase. Oh well, there's always Uncharted.",3,2012-06-10,XBOX 360,user
Blidly,"I wanted to like this game I swear. I loved the first two games and was prepared for more but I just couldnt love it like the others. The game plays very similary to Mass Effect 2 , though I have been spoilt by playing other amazing 3rd person shooters and this felt quite weightless and cover mechanic I didnt like. The enemies are quite generic and all follow similar patterns, meaning it felt repetitive. The game has been updated graphically to make it look fantastic , though with this high polygon count this means shepard always has to have his gun out like a sociopath. The story is awesome and I really enjoyed it, though ""cameo-ing"" all the characters from the previous game felt very cheesy , though was nice to see what happened to them. In the end the story was what pulled me through the boring action, if you've never played Mass Effect , play ME2 and then decide to continue. If you played the others, play through this just to finish your story.",7,2012-06-09,XBOX 360,user
FictionalOrange,"This game is thus far the best of the year- and perhaps could have been one of the best games of all time, save for lackluster ending. The journey to get to that ending, however, is what counts. People who say the ending ruined the whole series are idiots- the game is gorgeous from start to finish. The story is brilliant, the characters are well developed, and the gameplay is tight and satisfying. Player choice shapes the path to the conclusion, allowing each player to make their own story, although the ending itself is perhaps not as user-driven as many fans would like. Fans of the first two installments will not be disappointed with the game itself, although those seeking closure and every answer to every question posed in the mass effect universe should be wary that the conclusion provides neither. It is the ending of the game, which feels so disjointed from the rest of the game and unrelated to anything else in the entire series, that ultimately holds the game back from being one of the greatest of all time. That said, when taken as a whole, the game ties up many loose ends from the previous two installments and immerses new and old players alike in the series' rich lore. The graphics are gorgeous minus a few flaws here and there and the soundtrack is beautiful and haunting- the series' best. This game was beautifully executed (excluding the questionable ending) and dwarfs every other game I've played recently. It will stick with me for a while.

TheMaximalist,"The Mass Effect series for me has been one of the best for this generation and now Bioware is bringing us the final show down we have been waiting for since 2007. I must say this is one of my favorite games ever. The story is naturally awesome because the player makes it with the many more complex decisions and epic battles. The galaxy is in chaos and the only way to survive is to unite and to do this Shepard must bring the galaxy together. This idea allows Bioware to add those tough decisions and those epic battles so the game isn't so action centered like Mass Effect 2. Talking about the action all the shooting and power distribution mechanics have been smoothed and the game feels less static than ME2. The set pieces and the remarkable battles have made even more epic and weaves dialogue into it all. The graphics are great but not the best on 260 and the soundtrack was great and weapon sounds had a great bang bang to them. 360 users can also use Kniect to issue commands on the battlefield and speak in cutscenes. This was good most of the time but sometimes I did a really loud ""ohhh what do I do"" and it chose for me which ****. This game is suitably awesome with the whole shooter rpg mix done perfectly. Mass Effect 3 also includes co-op multiplayer which is a first for the series and I really enjoyed this. Most co-op multiplayer isn't really that compelling but this was great. It's a wave mode with bonus objectives which you gert credits for which you can spend on new characters,weapons and upgrades. There has been 2 free dlc packs with new characters and bonuses. Story-10-Mass Effect has always had a great story but this is amazing Graphics-8-Great sci-fi sfx and battlefields Sound-9-Weapons have great kicks and effects and the soundtrack is another sci fi epic Value-10-Mass Effect has always been about replaying for that perfect ending and this is no different Gameplay-9.5-Great shooting and cover mechanics, never gets old but a few tech glitches here and there Overall-46.5/50",9,2012-06-01,XBOX 360,user
braddogg623,"The ending . . . ugh. If you're checking Metacritic, you know the flaws of the ending of Mass Effect 3. It's a crime. But, the journey to the ending is tremendous, and the people giving a low rating to ME3 tend to focus on the last 10 minutes rather than the first 30 hours of the game. ME3 hits the balance between action and RPG: ME1 was nuts-and-bolts RPG (modding your guns took hours in total if you wanted to make a difference in gun performance), ME2 was very action-oriented (simplistic leveling system, minimal weapon upgrading, though the side quests mechanics of crew loyalty hinted at RPG roots). In ME3, you have the opportunity to really create a character with the combat strengths and weaknesses you desire. The shooter mechanics in ME3 were also very good. Despite some trouble grasping the cover system early on, I was able to complete the game on Insanity (high-level adept class imported from ME1 & ME2) without much difficulty, but with a lot of patience. The game featured more cut-scenes than I was accustomed to seeing in a Mass Effect game, which was disappointing, but the cut-scenes were good graphically and fit the general expectation I had of my Shepard. In short, ME3 is a good blending of ME1's RPG focus and ME2's action focus. I hated the ending, but I still give this game a 9/10. Especially if you played ME1 and ME2, you'll love ME3 except for the last 15 minutes. Stay tuned for free DLC to fix that ending, too.",9,2012-05-31,XBOX 360,user

There's very little choice with dialogue, and most of the time you don't even get a choice it's just auto-dialogue.

lllama408,"This game truly deserves a perfect score. Not based off track record with the entire series, but just looking at the single game itself, it's one of the games you hold onto forever just for the memories and replay ability. Just to get it out of the way, I understand everyone's frustrations with the ending scenes and how they felt there was no closure whatsoever, too bad. Questions don't always get answered, but that doesn't automatically cancel out everything the game had accomplished up to that point. It's like comparing it to a football player. His first 10 seasons of play are phenomenal and record breaking, but then he is human so he has a mediocre 11th year, and disregarding his entire career and saying he is a bust because he had one human effort of a year. The visuals are stunning all around, sound is great, gameplay is intense and innovative at times, and the story is beyond captivating especially if you have stuck around for the entire series. The multiplayer is beyond fun and time consuming, and satisfying when you unlock a new character before your friends do. The one knock I have on it is that you pretty much do have to play at the 2nd installment of the game before the 3rd to truly understand everything that is going on and not have TOO many questions starting off the game. Faltering it from just being a game a noob to the series can pick up and just start at. Lay off the bad ending, deal with it, move on to a new series, or hope it was BioWare's plan all along with the new DLC coming soon, or meaning the series isn't over.",10,2012-05-24,XBOX 360,user

GooBear,"Not the best of the Mass Effect series but it definitely doesn't deserve anything under a 5/10. Anything rated below are reviews based on bias opinion and nothing more. The gameplay has changed since the 1st two installments. AI and shooting mechanics have been largely improved but to the disappointment to most fans of the 1st game, the gameplay has evolved into more a shooter than RPG style. Skill building has actually improved from ME2 as now there are a lot more ways to evolve your squads abilities. In my personal opinion I enjoyed the story and I don't need to debate why. It seems like it's always a question of why I don't hate it. Your choices from the previous games are reflected all throughout the game but some choices within ME3's story aren't reflected where they should be. Now, to criticize on the actual flaws of ME3 (*note: these are mostly opinion). My #1 issue w/ it is the absence of Jack Wall. Suicide Mission/ The End Run was the best composition within a video game and was at least half of the epic-ness of ME2's ending. I know he chose to leave BioWare for other projects but still: Why work w/ the 1st 2 games then bail. Also, Clint Mansell's ""Leaving Earth"" is a complete rip-off of John Murphy's compositions from the main theme of the movie ""Sunshine"". It's even in my opinion that the Observation Room aboard the Normandy was practically ripped straight from this movie. Second: Ashley's appearance. She went from a ""girl you'd bring home to mama"" to a ""don't tell my boyfriend"" kinda girl. It kinda reminds me of young pop-stars who debut as a sweet innocent teen then turn to a raunchy sleaze as soon as they hit 18. The only other thing wrong w/ this game is some slight continuity issues w/ ""some"" decisions made in previous games and so-called plot holes discovered from over-analysis but they aren't enough of an issue to lose faith in this game or the development team behind it.",7,2012-05-23,XBOX 360,user

xGAMERxx,"Bioware has outdone themselves, this is an amazing game. But of course nothing is perfect. Like most other people, I too was disappointed with the terrible ending. But aside from the last 15 minutes or so, this game was truly amazing. Mass effect 3 starts where 2 left off. The reapers are coming at full force and it's up to Shepard to save the entire galaxy. If you haven't already, I suggest that you pick up mass effect 1 and 2 and play them in order so everything falls into place, just so you won't end up confused (and you will get to meet some awesome characters along the way.) The thing I love most about mass effect is the characters. You actually start caring for the characters, each character has their own individual personality, you feel sad for the character, happy, and hey you might even be attracted to them. You could continue relationships from Mass effect 1-2 and it is really satisfying to see your character, and others develop. As i've said before the story is great aside from the last 15 mins. It really pulls you in and you just can't wait to see what happens next. The gameplay is a lot more fast paced compared to its predecessors but it works. All in all Mass effect 3 is a great game. it's a lot of fun, from seeing all of the awesome characters develop, to choosing to be a hero or a jerk, to the combat. This game receives a 9 from me.

Fullmetal,"I have to address the elephant in the room. Many of the users who gave this game a negative review might not have understood what the ending signified. With that said, I will not reveal here what it means. That is for those who complete the game and have questions to try and solve. The fact of the matter is that this game had such a large scale of intergalactic drama that it was byfar the best Mass Effect to date. The amount of time invested in the game was a complete payoff to what I discovered about the end of the game. The fact that fans didn't understand the ending is a problem though. Hopefully, Bioware will release something to let everyone know what I discovered after looking into the game deeper. I'm not going to bash anyone who didn't like the game, but I urge them to wait and see. It really is an intelligent ending to a game. Just look at Knights of the Old Republic 2's ending. It was a total WTF moment, and fans really didn't freak out about that. If you want an ending that isn't roses and tulips, play this one to the end.

I don't know what happened, if some of the better writers left between games, but the story in this one is cringe-worthy at every turn with few exceptions. I'd have rather this game had not even came out, which is saying a lot since I'd been looking forward to this conclusion of commander Shepard's story for the past 5 years or so. Don't buy this game.",0,2012-05-20,XBOX 360,user
RS13,"Suppose I told you a story: Big bad guys invaded the galaxy, alone hero struggled to unite the galaxy in opposition to the baddies. The baddies weakness is discovered. There's a final showdown with the baddies above the hero's home planet. The baddies lose. Suppose I told you this story: Big bad guys invade the galaxy and no one can stop them. But in the darkest hour plans for a super weapon is discovered. Now our heroes must race to complete the weapon, before there's no galaxy left to save. The first one's probably a little better, but each is a decent story right? Now suppose I told you they were the *same* story. Wait, what? And suppose I told you that this story was made by a developer that prides itself on making ""Story-based gaming."" ""Ha!"" you'd say ""that would be a terrible story. Each story gets to the same conclusion, so putting them together renders half of the story useless."" ""Besides, the stories are really incompatible. The first is more about a single character. The second is more about teams of scientists and engineers and the soldiers who buy them time. In the second the bad guys are unstoppable in the first they're just hard to stop. In the second the galaxy would be throwing everything they had at the enemy, just to slow them down for a bit. In the first, those troops need to be saved for the final battle."" And now you'd realize this isn't hypothetical. Forget what you've heard about the ending. Mass effect 3's story just isn't any good. (And if you're wondering the half that you *play* is the half that gets rendered useless.) Toss in the facts that: -31 of the 68 ME3 missions are fetch quests (For comparison ME1 had 5 fetch quests and ME2 had 11) -The ending you get depends on how many of these fetch quests you do, though not in any narratively coherent way (you get a better ending the more you do). -It is impossible to get the best ending without playing multiplayer (YES, that's right. The ending to a three game single player story depends on whether you want to play multiplayer.) -Of the 15 possible surviving squad mates you get no more than 4 back. -Most of your decisions in ME1 and 2 are irrelevant, including some of the biggest decisions in the game. -Your dialogue options are more limited, often including only a top and bottom choice and Shepard sometimes speaks without you having any control over what he says. -None of Cerberus's interactions with Shepard make any sense. What's their endgame? Why do they care if Shepard unites the galaxy? And of course, -The terrible ending. To be fair, ME3 did have much better combat than ME1 or 2 and some of the missions (Rannoch and Tuchanka) are among the best in the series, but those two points do not a good game make. Combat's a side issue in Mass Effect and those missions are part of a larger story that utterly fails.",3,2012-05-20,XBOX 360,user

I'm not one for CoD online as I get pasted but this team based multiplayer game provides a fantastic alternative. I for one am re-playing the main campaign as a different class (oh yes, not a solder this time but a biotic with jedi knight like powers). After that maybe as an engineer. There's so much that's good about this game that no one should let the criticism of the game ending put you off. If you've not played 1 and 2 then by all means buy them, as they give context to this game, but it does work on it's own.

Hybridiction,"This is the score the game actually deserves. Now before you down-vote me, you will find if you average around the fifty + critic scores the game received it would be around the 89-93 area. Take off the moronic user score feature metacritic, it is used as a tool by a bunch of forum trolls and butthurt fanboys who really have no clue how to review a game. Of course this review will be down-voted by them, and I'll probably be called a ""**** up"" to the gaming media, but let's look at the facts first. High expectations almost always lead to disappointment, and those who have insanely high expectations will always be disappointed. This is why when you look at a game objectively, or rather as it is, instead of what you wanted it to be, you would find that it truly is a good game. Whether you disagreed with the ending or had problems because you ""Felt"" that the choices you made in the previous installments weren't reflected enough, it really doesn't matter. It's no reason to give this game a score below 7, and the fact that this game is rated a 3.9 is really quite pathetic. To even think that this game is only worth a ""3.9"" you would have to be some grumpy old man living in some old folks home or some kid who stays in his room all day, has no friends and doesn't know how to enjoy quality entertainment. The decisions you made in the previous games do reflect in this one, and yes they matter. Characters that die in ME2 wont be around, characters you saved in ME1 do make an appearance and yes your choices DID have reflect in ME3. Name a game that carries the choices you made from game to game on the same level mass effect has? You cant, there is only stand alone games with choices like the witcher 2, but what game from sequel to sequel to sequel does what the ME series has?. The fact people cry because they feel that their choices never meant anything is LAUGHABLE seeing as how they have nothing to compare it to. Give mass effect some credit, it has done a pretty damned good job. The ending to the series is fine, and honestly it really doesn't matter what bioware did people would have cried and crapped their pants. Everybody has a different idea of how it should have ""ended"" Bioware cant possibly meet everybody's expectations. The gameplay was much improved from the previous two, they added in some more RPG elements, still not as robust as ME1 but pretty close with the talent choices, weapon mods and tons of armor and loot to find. Mass effect 3 is a good game that sold well and that the majority of people enjoyed playing, don't listen to the vocal minority of idiots on here who probably pirated the game or never even played it at all and are just jumping on the hate bandwagon to hate the game like it's some ""fad"" to do so or makes them ""cool and different"" ****, sit down and enjoy the game.

WiteFalcon,"My favourite gaming franchise, I loved Mass Effects 1-3 so much, that I have 5 characters and have completed minimum of 4 playthroughs through ME1 & 2. Mass Effect 3 is an AWESOME game, no doubt about it. It's setting the standard for story based games and RPGs, now and for the future. Although I didn't mind the ending, I found it cool actually, it could of been WAY more awesome, by including prior decisions into the outcome of the ending and leaves things out. Pros: - Hooks you in with all elements (Even if your new to the series) - Great refined gameplay! (This game is pretty much Gears of War except more sci-fi and with RPG gameplay and story shaping) - Shape the story to how you want (This includes a lot of prior decisions made, unlike most games your previous saves matter!) - Great sense of characterisation for who you play as! (You really feel as if you are Shepard) Cons: - New players forced for a few elements of the game to occur (Which they have no choice over as they don't have a previous save file for the game to recognise) (Such as Wrex's death) - Crew development was a lot better in Mass Effect 2 (Its less about other people and more about Shepard) - Ending is confusing (Many people would agree, but it doesn't ruin the ending, just leaves blanks for you to imagine to fill in) - The game doesn't take into account EVERYTHING you've done in previous games, and areas are left unturned, and the ending doesn't take into account prior choices. All in all, an incredible experience that has changed the world of gaming forever and succeeds highly, but could of strived for complete perfection. Hence the 9 instead of perfect 10.",9,2012-05-17,XBOX 360,user
enFenix,"Despite having a rough start, with some hiccups along the way, and a troubled finish to the series, I thoroughly enjoyed the game. Granted, I went into playing this game being aware that there was a very large outcry of complaints regarding the endings available in the game. With that in mind, I was prepped for a very disappointing ending to the title and the series. Regarding the endings, I will say this one non-spoiling thing: They're not half as bad as the die-hards are suggesting. The game makes suggestions throughout it's entire story about what would be on the table in the last few moments of the story, so I'm unaware why people were so shocked. The diversity of endings, in my opinion, were nothing different from the previous installations. Mass Effect 1 & 2 both had endings which varried SLIGHTLY depending on many of the players decisions throughout the titles, however the major results of each of the original 2 titles endings never changed. The diversity was in supporting details. So my thoughts regarding the backlash of the chosen ending of the game is for people to stop complaining and enjoy the game for what it is. Outside of the more controversial issue, the story of the game is wonderfully written, and incorporates many facets of the original 2 games, including the decisions made by the player in the original titles. The details surrounding the core plot of the game during my play-through vastly differed from that of my friends experience. I was impressed by the games potential for diversity in ancillary details. Graphically, to be honest, I feel the engine has hit it's apex and is beginning to age. However, it was still a visually-enjoyable game. The game-play experience itself was well fleshed-out, although I feel the second instalment of the series takes the crown in this category. The side-quest of searching through the galaxy for bonus resources/items/etc was very basic and un-interesting. The combat system seemed to be a little flawed this time around, where actions I expected my character would make were not, well, made. The voice-recognition for the Kinect was fun for a bit, but then become an irritation. That is my own personal experience, others may enjoy it greatly. Overall, I suggest you be aware that the ending has some controversy around it, and otherwise enjoy this game for everything it offers between the start and the finish.",8,2012-05-16,XBOX 360,user

Multiplayer is fun addition although it not essential to play it for the single player campain, general wave based attack awarded weapon packs as rewards.

Nizzy,"If you are looking for a game that gives you a real sense of accomplishment at the end, ME3 is not the game for you. That being said, the rest of the game is top-notch. I would have liked more characters as well, but complaining about wanting more out of your game says a lot about how well what is there really is. Multiplayer gameplay in particular is superb with a simple design that nonetheless manages to remain fresh and different every match. Add to that the sound quality which is phenomenal; monsters sound monstrous, robots and technology sounds are totally immursive, and the voicework is entirely organic with no sense of separate sound stages strung together. Is the last 10 minutes bad enough to ruin the rest of the game? Maybe. I don't really have any argument against the opinions of all those who gave it a ""0,"" but for me it remains a solid game I'll probably play again; I just try not to think about the emptiness I know will come when I am done.",7,2012-05-16,XBOX 360,user

Naglfar,"A fantastic conclusion to the best sci fi rpg saga to take place on home consoles. Mass Effect 3's inclusion of all your decisions from the first two games and their DLC is an amazing achievement and adds a deeper affection for you character and his/her surviving allies from it's predecessors. The combat has been improved over Mass Effect 2 to be more responsive and free moving but still includes the weapon and thermal clip progressions made in that title. The graphics have improved again giving the game more feeling from being on an ominous dark space station to a foreign planets landscape it all looks stunning. The multiplayer is also compelling with a Gears Of War style 'Horde' mode in which four players can fight waves of enemies from varying factions Cerberus/Reaper/Geth to level up their favoured character class/race and earn money to buy card packs which unlock random weapons/characters/upgrades in an addictive one more game fashion.

jZero,"Mass Effect 3 is a GREAT game with just a few problems. THE GOOD: The fighting and action in this game are to me definitely the best in the series. The enemies are harder, smarter and especially near the end of the game overwhelming (in a good way.) I feel the RPG elements are done pretty well with the decisions of the past games actually effect what you can/ can't do in this game. Graphics are great and the sound is very well done. THE BAD: There were some polish issues in this game: a broken turret (wouldn't die) made me replay a level, there was a galaxy that blinked even though there was nothing to do, and other similar issues. I felt that some of the characters were just kind of thrown in just because they were in the previous games with no real story or purpose. The ending.. while not as bad as people make it to be, could've been much better. My biggest problem with the ending is that for a game with so much choice and different paths/ results the endings were all the same, literally they just changed the color of the explosion. And you are left hanging as to the aftermath for the Normandy, other galaxies, etc. That said this game is MUCH BETTER than people give it credit, people are way too harsh.

Mark_Walrusburg,"I cannot believe this is what happened to the series. I made three different Shepard's, plugged in hours crafting each one for a specific play through. I held off on playing the game until I was done with this semester of classes because I wanted to seriously throw myself in. I've been dreading it because of what I've been hearing about the fiasco of an ending. Well I finally sat down and played it, DAY 1 DLC included on my purchase because EA believes unfinished games being released are a great way to introduce content. Well never again. I have been following Bioware since knights of the old republic and I've enjoyed nearly every game (Dragon Age 2 excluded) flaws and all. Mass Effect 3 however, has somehow managed to instill a serious and incredibly ANNOYING sense of betrayal. How can a game company betray me? I'm not asking as though, ""HOW COULD YOU DO THIS ME BIOWARE??"" It's more, ""No no this makes no sense, you are not an individual capable of actually betraying me Bioware, you are a game company. The concept is ridiculous."" But even so! It's as if an old friend suddenly spit in my face and left smiling after I handed him seventy dollars. It's that feeling that has me just so disgusted that I would even feel like that over a video game. I was genuinely invested in this series and now I'm left just mulling over from time to time how horrible it was at the end. My choices didn't matter, my time put into the series had no real effect on the outcome. Killing or saving the Rachni Queen has no real impact. Uniting the Geth and the Quarian's has no real impact. The replay value of this game in my opinion is non-existent. My three Shepards have no genuine purpose other than to succumb to the will **** star child that shows up at the last ten minutes of the game. Why are there such massive plot holes in this final installment? If the Mass Relays exploding don't wipe out billions of lives and strand countless more can't the writers see how sloppy their work is? I've never made a review before, and this is my first time posting on metacritic. This final game to a wonderful series has left me with a bitter taste and a hole in my wallet.

I have every DLC for every Mass Effect and the conclusions literally just tossed it all out of the **** for multiplayer, it isn't bad, but it isn't good either. Lack of different modes coupled with a small selection of maps with few enemy variations is just too repetitive. Bioware also hasn't helped by openly criticizing the fans for caring and one said that the fans ""aren't producers!"" This is true, but following the atrocious ending (in my opinion) Bioware should've looked more closely at it, from a fan's point of view. How can you miss your own lore!?

LordKinoda,"Mass Effect 3 is still a great game, however, it falls short in the end. There are some great additions, and just a little too many subtractions. I love the way the guns sound and 'hit' in this game, that was a great little mod. They got rid of 'heavy' weapons except in certain plot points, also nice. You can actually carry all weapons, and not just a select few according to your class, nice. Biotic powers are great as well, love the new sounds and moves. Sprinting is essentially unlimited, which is more realistic, especially for a cybernetically altered soldier like Shepard. They slimmed down the 'scanning for resources' minigame, definitely better. Did away with the silly hacking minigames and just showing the omni-tool animation, this is cool too. So all said and done the gameplay is improved on almost all levels. Love that they brought Ashley/Kaiden back. **** not to have a romance option in Mass Effect 2. However their interactions with Shepard could of been a little more. More is always better when it comes to character development, especially when it comes to romances in a world where you're all set to be the savior of the galaxy. Shepard needs something 'real' to fight for. They do have Shepard say this, just wanted more interaction is all. Now for the bad. It feels like a lot of the dialog choices were taken away. Way too many instances where there is only 'good' and 'evil' selections. That 'neutral' option is needed sometimes because it just fits better. Rarely any 'paragon' or 'renegade' choices (the blue and red text ones) to use in the dialog as well. The graphics still **** in a lot of places though. Don't know why they couldn't of fixed this somehow. The textures are blurry and lackluster for almost all 'clothing' in the game. The armors are mostly great, but anybody who isn't wearing any has a skewed look to them. Day 1 DLC, honestly I could care less. I bought the collector's edition so it came with the game. I paid more money yes, but so what ? I like this game and didn't mind shelling out for it. The story is still great, though like many others I'm not in love with the ending either. I won't sit here and say they should come out with DLC to 'fix' it. It's not so terrible that it ruins the entire game. However I will say that the game would of received a rating of 9 from me had it ended somewhere closer to what I would of liked to see happen. Sorry.

sheepishdolphin,"Ignore the stupid reviews sub 7. This is a fantastic game. Everything is improved- the storylines are fantastic. The set pieces are enjoyable. There are big decisions to make. Each mission, unlike previous games, features a unique, totally different environment which are amazingly well realised and lovingly crafted. The soundtrack is sublime and the voice acting ranges from good to fantastic. The controls are pretty much spot on, and each character class means that there is a style of play to suit every player. I love using biotic abilities, throwing enemies around and letting my team finish them while they are in the air. Basically you are going around the galaxy assembling forces and 'assests' for the impending galactic war.Multiplayer is pretty good, it is skanky that you basically need to play it to get the best endings, but it is a good diversion. And the ending.. taken at face value, it is pretty poor, but fitting I thought. However, look up online about a theory with regards to the ending. There are hits and titbits throughout the game which explain the ending, seal the holes, and turn it from being pretty lame into damn clever as hell- for players who are insightful enough to figure it out. Right now I'm nearing the end of my 2nd playthough, straight after finishing it a first time.

resolent,"The Mass Effect franchise started strongly with ME1, a combination RPG shooter that while a little wooden at times, was an engaging and entertaining game. ME2 built on this, adding flesh to the story and depth to the galaxy while improving slightly on the slightly awkward combat dynamic of ME1. ME3 has bettered it's forebears, with a fluid combat system, improved interface and truly engrossing story. Further, the added multiplayer element offers brilliant gameplay and well thought out locations to enjoy with friends. The graphics and cut-scenes are high end throughout and the soundtrack at times breathtaking. Given the number of decisions made in the journey from ME1 to ME3's ending, the limited number of ending options is a little disappointing, but overall this is a strong finish to the ME series.",9,2012-05-04,XBOX 360,user
CrAEckY,"First of all i like to say that ""Mass Effect 3"" is one of the best games ever made in my opinion, even the whole series is awesome. As the reaction of many gamers shows, i am not alone who expected a marvelous finale at the end of this Sci-Fi Triology! And what have i became? A crappy nonsense telling end, that is it. That was the great announced final? I do not think so, i do not get it! So i have rated the game with 2/10 not in case of the gameplay or atmosphere, i did it, because the ending really pissed me off like most of you and EA/Bioware's Statement handled us, the Fans/Gamers like idiots and ignored our support over the last 5 years. I mean, look at all the feature's they have promised. At the end, none of the decisions i have made during the first two parts is considered. What happened at all? You can choose like in ""Deus Ex 3"" between 3 endings. Do not tell me that i have to level my readiness til 5000 pts.+ or my renegade/paragon bar to the max. Treat gamers like that is perky and unforgettable! Check out ""Angry Joe's"" Review or 10 Reasons why the ending really **** for Example: ****/watch?v=6M0Cf864P7E At least Bioware was sold out by Electronic Arts and get's in a row with Companies like Bullfrog, Maxis, Origin, Westwood and some more. It is all about cash and income shares for the Shareholders, nothing else matters. So, i have decided for my own that i will not support such ignorant policy again and i have canceled my SWToR-Account too. I do not buy a game of EA and Bioware again, til that Day ""Mass Effect 3"" will become some real endings, belongs to the choices i have made! My suggestion for you, do the same! Otherwise EA/Bioware do it again and again...",2,2012-05-03,XBOX 360,user

shachenau,"The gameplay itself is a vast improvement on its predecessors, keeping the actiony flow of Mass Effect 2 while both bringing back the more in-depth RPG elements of the first Mass Effect and relaxing some of the series' questionable class-based weapon restrictions. It is long, and for the most part, it is enjoyable, with a surprisingly well-implemented multiplayer facet that is vaguely reminiscent of Payday: The Heist. These technical improvements do not stop it from being the weakest and least inspiring installation of the series, however, decorating its plot with a slew of empty ""consequences"" of actions past and its exploration with an absence of content-- Mako exploration was ill-received, and planet-scanning was ill-received, but instead of attempting a compromise or a new system, exploration was mostly rendered inconsequential. The Citadel remains the only re-visitable area of interest, while galactic exploration is turned into a mild annoyance and the rest of the explorable galaxy is turned into setpieces. There is one critical mistake made in this game, and that is that the integrity of the gameplay was sacrificed for the integrity of the setting and plot. The steps taken to make the Reapers feel like an actual threat simply serve to make various segments of the game annoying at best and frustrating at worst. Players invested in the first two games have a pretty substantial likelihood of being frustrated and upset by Bioware's insistence on compromising the more rewarding aspects of decision-making and exploration in exchange for a more ""believable"" setting, improved combat being the only net positive of this trilogy-ender.",6,2012-04-29,XBOX 360,user

The team behind these games really polished the engine and concept from ME2 and made it work better than ever in ME3. It's true, for many the ending may detract from the experience for some (I was not disappointed, but I can see how it would seem unfulfilling for some, and why DLC is coming to flesh it out). The rest of the game though is tremendous, and even the multiplayer works well (and is FUN).

The whole thing is so completely out of place in the context of the previous games that it has to be some sort of clever ploy by Bioware so they can spring some DLC with the real ending.

CaptainAwesomer,"This is the best looking of all the Mass Effects, they finally used some decent anti-aliasing on the edges. It's a perfect game except for midway through when you have to switch discs back and forth about 8 times. A few boss battle's difficulty are 10x higher than the rest of the game (or even the level they're on). And using the A button for everything is infuriating, especially on multiplayer when you NEED to revive a team mate, but instead you send your character into cover and everyone dies. The Day 1 DLC doesn't even matter, because the rest of the game is just packed with missions and story and cut-scenes. To finish all of those takes around 35 hours.",8,2012-04-25,XBOX 360,user
FellFerreira,"Mass Effect pra mim eh o simbolo maior da geracao atual, sempre fui fa desde o primeiro e comprei minha edicao de colecionador por tamanho respeito e carinho que tenho pela saga. O que falar entao de Mass Effect sem parecer um fanboy? Historia irada, personagens incriveis, tecnica perfeita, mecanica anos luz a frente do primeiro e jah sensacional Mass Effect original. Eh Mass Effect 3 eh muito melhor do que eu imaginava, o unico jogo longo que estava torcendo pra nao acabar, nao por causa do final polemico (ate pq achei sensacional) mas porque eu sei que ao fechar seria o fim, e eu realmente nao queria o fim. Sheppard, Garrus, Thane, Jack, eu realmente vou sentir falta deles, sao personagens que me envolvi e o mais sensacional evoluiram ao longo da historia. Tenho uma coisa a dizer, Bioware muito obrigado pela experiencia, pelos momentos de indecisao de ficar por minutos pensando nas consequencias de minhas acoes, muito obrigado pela estadia na Normandy. Mass Effect 3 tem ainda um bom adendo o multiplayer, nao eh algo sensacional mas devido ao incrivel background torna a experiencia bacana, Quero muito DLCs muito mesmo, e as vezes fico imaginando plots indivduais para cada personagem.

The choose your own actions seems lacking at best of times and extremely dull. The OTT action sequence that are meant to real in the masses aren't that impressive, and instantly forgettable. After finishing the first 2 (especially the 1st) I just couldn't help myself in letting everyone around me know how awesome they were.

OverDos,"Everybody needs to take a chill pill. Don't bash the game because of personal opinion towards subjects unrelated to the game's final product. The point of a User Review isn't to complain about a company, its about to rate a game so potential buyers know what they're getting themselves into. Anyway, I think the game is solid, but is the weakest in the series. However, that isn't saying much since i'd give the last two games 10/10's. Mass Effect 3 really is a great game with a breathtaking storyline, but it missed the mark in terms of how innovative the game truly could have been. The differences between the first and second games were huge. So many things had changed for the better, and, in my opinion, some things had been changed for the worst. Instead of correcting mistakes made previously in Mass Effect 2, EA chose to use an almost identical mold for the third game. The potential of learning from the first and second games' mistakes was virtually ignored. I suppose in the end though, the game was fun and it was worth the buy. I just they did more with it. As for the dreaded ending that everybody is up in arms about, it isn't as bad as people claim it to be. The game's grand finale is whatever you make of it. Chances are it wont end the way you had imagined it would and therefore you might not like it. The fact of the matter is, the developers designed an ending that they believed was appropriate. Whether or not you accept that is up to you. I didn't think it was all that bad. The Pros: +4 Points for a great story +2 Points for solid gameplay +2 Point for the new multiplayer The Cons: -1 Point for lack of originality -1 Point for using the Mass Effect 2 formula",8,2012-04-24,XBOX 360,user
SaltyRT,"Let me begin by saying that Mass Effect 3 is an excellent game, and is worthy of the five star rating I have assigned to it. However, you may have heard some lackluster comments about the ending, and yes, the ending was a disappointment for me, as well as many others, but this doesn't detract much from the rest of the game. The gun play has been refined to the point of near perfection, and the RPG elements have been expanded upon from Mass Effect 2, though still not as in-depth as Mass Effect, which in my opinion was a bit too complex. However, it feels as if the game took a hit in the story department, limiting your overall choices in conversations by removing the neutral options. It may seem as if I'm complaining about the story, but across all three games, it's still one of the best stories ever told in gaming. (And if you're concerned about the ending, Bioware has confirmed that a free DLC titled ""Extended Cut"" will be released this summer, hopefully putting an end to everyone's ending woes.) While Mass Effect 3 may not be as amazing as it's predecessor, Mass Effect 2, they are both definitely worthy of being on the list of the best games I have ever played. 9.7/10",10,2012-04-24,XBOX 360,user

TookYoCookies,"Terrible ending, devolution of game play, auto dialogue.. It's clear EA wanted this game made to cater to the most broad, widest, biggest, general audience possible and in doing so destroyed what made the game good to begin with. The unique setting,story, and character interaction blended with third person shooter action made Mass Effect 1 and 2, two of the greatest games of all time, and lead to Mass Effect 3 being one of the most anticipated games of all time. Despite the great critical and commercial success of the first two entries in the ME trilogy that most game developers could only dream of, EA and Bioware wanted to broaden the target audience to appeal to a much wider demographic, and in doing so, shot them selves, and the ME fiction in the foot; effectively killing what could very well have been the greatest trilogy of games the medium had ever seen. The uniqueness of the game, and cohesion of the story, were sacrificed for something that only die-hard, mountain dew chugging Michael Bay fans would be proud of. In their commercially driven motivation for Mass Effect 3, Bioware made the mistake of thinking that making the game more like the handful of other action-oriented shooters out there would make this game better; which was a tremendous mistake. the unique blend of story, characters, player driven narrative, impactful decisions made by the player, and solid TPS action is what made the game so popular. Attempting to make the game like every other TPS game out there, turned a master piece into just another bland, white/black, piece of gaming mediocrity. The most sad part of it all, is just the fact that had they stayed the course, the ME universe wouldve remained a cash-cow for years and years to come. EA has showed incompetence on a major level in the past 5 years of gaming, and their lack of foresight on this game alone goes above and beyond ""dropping the ball"". This kind of blunder in any other industry would see entire executive boards sacked, and call for serious coming-to-jesus meetings within the company to determine where they went wrong and how to make it right. Time to stop focusing on marketing, and start actually making good games. Just because the critics on game review sites THAT YOU FUND, think your game is perfect; doesnt mean anything.",0,2012-04-22,XBOX 360,user
TheTelePlus,"Coming into ME3 I was very much expecting a car crash, an unplayable, uninteresting mess not even worth my time. I guess that shows you really can't trust either end of the spectrum these days, Critics were praising it as the second coming of the Christ where as the vast majority of fans were claiming it was the worst game since Superman64. In reality ME3 is neither of these. Where as ME1 was an RPG that felt like a bad TPS and ME2 was just plain bad ME3 strikes the perfect balance between being an RPG and TPS, significantly more weapons and armour than ME2 also offer some nice replay value for completionists looking to collect everything. Unfortunately the story seems to have gotten worse in pretty much every way conceivable, sure there are some great scenes that tap into the ME1 and to a lesser extent ME2 nostalgia but they're just that, scenes. ME3 has the least amount of interactive conversations of the entire series, which just plain ****. Most scenes play out similar to the Normandy conversations with Zaeed in ME2, the frequency of these is kind of annoying when you look back at ME1 which had an abundance of in-depth conversations with most of the throw-away characters, this in conjunction with it's terrible, terrible ending mean it's hard to recommend ME3 to fans of the series and really there are a great deal more, and better story driven TPS out there if you're coming to ME3 for a shooter. Then there's the multiplayer, let me sum up the multiplayer with a single clause. The multiplayer clearly detracted from the quality of the single-player and ME3 would have been a better game had it not existed. Overall It's hard to recommend ME3 to anyone, it relies too heavily on series nostalgia to be enjoyable for people looking to get into the series this late and isn't a particularly great shooter either. ME3 is one of the most severe cases of wasted potential I've seen in a while. Mediocre at best - 6/10",6,2012-04-22,XBOX 360,user

NATED066,"I'm giving this game a 5 out of 10. For context, my review for both Mass Effect 1 and Mass Effect is 9.5 out of 10. Storyline aside, my rationale for giving the low score is due to the fact that they have changed an important game mechanic... the ability to holster your weapon during breaks in combat. This is something that was available in ME1 and ME2, and the lack of it in ME3 seriously breaks the flow and makes the game less enjoyable. In the previous installments you would have a battle, then holster you gun and explore, then if more baddies cropped up, you would draw your gun again. This is much more realistic than ALWAYS having your gun drawn. Fighting bad guys? Gun drawn. No bad guys around? Gun drawn. Exploring crates? Gun drawn. Talking to teammates? Gun drawn. No one else on your team has their gun drawn? Gun drawn. It is a HUGE flaw in an otherwise good game, and I am shocked that Bioware removed it.

acisawesome,"Ah yes ""Mass Effect is an awful game series"", I have dismissed that claim. ME3 brings in quite a few innovations to the table since ME2, and I think that it brings in almost all of your major choices from previous games amazingly. The combat is quite similar to the untrained eye, and, even though that would be a good thing anyway (ME2's combat system was sublime) it's not true. Combat it ME3 is much more brutal, difficult and it forces you to make use of its environments (which are a much more 3-dimensional setting than previous games. One mission in it particular forces you to pull out every trick you have in an attempt to survive long enough to finish (immensely difficult on insanity). The combat it also much more cinematic, being able to pull enemies over cover near you at either stab them, crush them, or a variety of other things much to my humor. The story (ending excluded, is one of, if not the best writing in games I have ever played, pulling at emotional heart strings, but with enough witty dialogue to keep it from being depressing. In response to the ending controversy, is the ending good, god no, does it makes sense, again no, but does it ruin the entire series, or even the game? No, do you know what I did when I finished ME3? I sat down and played it again. Then I went out and bought points for the ""From Ashes"" DLC, (not necessary, but I would recommend it, it adds to the story and adds some interesting dialogue) got that onto the game, but I didn't play it as soon as I got that. I went back to ME1and started the whole series again (that's about 40 hours a game, 50 if your going for everything like I was). And I still loved the journey as Commander Shepard, even though the ending was lack luster. The multiplayer is surprisingly good, and I found myself surprised at how much I was enjoying it, though it is harder than the single player campaign, and with the free ""Resensurgence"" DLC that was released earlier, its only getting better, the only fault is it doesn't show your total play time, but I can forgive that. So, in the end Mass Effect 3 is a modern triumph in games, with some faults (ending, and loss of SOME dialogue options (though you still retain most of them)). Take this review from a fan who has put over a thousand hours into Mass Effect, over a thousand hours into EACH Mass Effect and that isn't including the multiplayer, this game is great, perfect? No, but still a modern miracle in the gaming. As a side note, all of these awful reviews (the 0, and 1's) are from fans who feel cheated by the ending, and are so angry that they cant see that the journey there is magnificent. Some of them are right about it, but they have far to harshly judged it. e.g. the ending is awful, I can never play Mass Effect again 0/10; which I proved wasn't always true in this review. All I can do now is urge you to buy this game (and the others as well, they make it better, especially if you save a guy called Wrex in the first game, his dialogue is amazing).",10,2012-04-21,XBOX 360,user

jonahlee,"I have been a huge fan of this series and bought the collector's edition of all 3 games, but after finishing Mass Effect 3 I have not only lost all interest in the series, but will never be playing another BioWare game. The ending negates everything you did in all 3 games, and doesn't take into account anything that you did along the way, it just comes down to 3 arbitrary choices, all of which are bad, and make no sense. And it is too bad, because I honestly thought this was the best game I ever played until I hit the end, but seeing the 3 endings provided (really one ending with some variations) has left an empty feeling in my stomach, and ruined the entire story for me. I will not pay for any more download content (which is how the game ends telling you to wait for download content that will be coming), nor playing another BioWare game ever again. I just don't understand how the game could not only not allow the choice that the whole series is built on, but also not even seem to understand what you had accomplished in the game.

NOTHING and its EAs fault, the made the game end in a cliffhanger so you buy the next DLC or game is BS i can take the lack of squadmates since when you interact with your squadmates its more intresting than in ME1 or 2 but that ending makes you not want to play the game agin... i went on a FULL ON RAGE QUIT deleted my first save started a new one and not going to finish it agin until the extended cut DLC and hope that the next gamplay DLC it isint pre-end DLC like ME1 HOLD THE LINE ask for a well explaind ending with no plot holes and pos-ending DLC and more gameplay like in ME2 where you can keep playing after finishing the game. my hope is still up dont give the game a bad score just becuse of the last 10 minutes, they can still fix it , its not like if the problem was gameplay or the whole story its JUST THE LAST 10 MINUTES THAT WE WANT FIXED Bioware Have a nice day, and play Multiplayer witch is GREAT until the Extended cut comes out and see whats nex for Our Commander Shepard",9,2012-04-18,XBOX 360,user
Runfocovah,"I will give this game a 7 why?, well it truly starts good, but the last part feels rushed and the ending feels like a book from stephen king... **** ending. Your past decisions does not have much of impact neither your current ones for the ending. then there is multiplayer, its cool and fun but I keep getting booted of EA servers along with tons of other players, besides there is this glitch where my game freezes at a never ending loading screen at the main menu and I have to do a ritual of disconnecting xbox from internet and such and reconnecting it to be able to play.

Sparpnsexyoak,"I'll keep it short and sweet on this one promise. I loved Me1, Me2 and Me3. It is quite possibly my favourite set of games ever made, however this being said I will concede that Mass Effect 3 had some flaws. Yes it wasn't perfect and if I'm really honest I was not blown away by the ending. To continue in this honest fashion I was expecting the worse based on internet commentary and had I ignored it I probably would have been a lot happier, but on with the review! Mass Effect 3 has a great story and incredible lore to back it up. The action in number 3 is better than either 1 or 2 and you really get the sense that the galaxy is falling apart around you. The visuals are stunning and go a long way to immersing you in the game, yes sometimes things pop in and out but when your looking up at a huge freaking planet on fire, as you gun down loads of husks standing between you and ultimate victory everything seems perfect! I couldn't live with myself if I gave it a perfect score as that would be silly, I expect flawless for that. This said users who score it a zero seriously needs to grow up a bit and be fair to the game as a whole, no game deserves that and least of all Mass Effect.",8,2012-04-18,XBOX 360,user

TStout,"This review may be a bit biased in light of a few facts: I love the previous installments in the series so much that I had really high expectations for this game, the conversation mechanic didn't feel as important in this installment as in previous games in the series since halfway through the game you don't really choose dialogue anymore, and the ending of this game turned me way off because there were too many unanswered questions. Basically all three endings were based on the last decision you make, so if you logged serious hours in the series, be ready for disappointment. There is one exception in which your Galaxy at War progress and your single player preparation come into play, but even in that case, there are an unsatisfactory amount of answers compared to my expectations for the conclusion. I do enjoy the multiplayer, but it is difficult to find matches at times which is a fatal flaw for any online cooperative play. Overall, if I didn't already own this title, I would only rent it long enough to beat the game, and I would probably wait until all the DLC packs are out so I could make the most efficient use of my time.",5,2012-04-17,XBOX 360,user

Raithix,"It would be easy for me to give into emotions and give Mass Effect 3 a low score for the same reasons many of my fellow fans have. I could rail against the ending and any number of minor nuances, but to do so would be dishonest and misleading. The fact of the matter is, for 95 percent of Mass Effect 3, the game is immaculate. Combat is precise, dialogue is to the same level it has been since the first game, and the cutscenes are absolutely stunning. Seeing the galactic war against the Reapers is breathtaking and magnificent, and was emotionally impactful in a way I have never felt from a video game before. Of course, this made the ending all that much more heartwrenching, and for emotionally invested fans of the series like myself, disappointment, depression, and anger are likely to come about. For players new to the Mass Effect series, this game has to rate a perfect 10, as it is the best installment in the series, and gives a massively immersive feel not seen in many games. For fans of the previous two games, however, it has to rate a bittersweet 7.5. A slightly railroaded plot coupled with a bizarre ending make the conclusion to the franchise a hard pill to swallow, even if the majority of the game is absolutely beautiful, whether we want to admit it or not.",9,2012-04-16,XBOX 360,user

MentalKase6288,"Overall I give the 6 and here is why: Story: Excellent! Well up until the last 10min. Pretty much when you play this game and you meet the glowing child. Just restart your Xbox and you won't have the fanchise ruined. Gameplay: Good. Single Player: The power combinations come in handy for some of the more difficult enemies. Still don't care about the limited ammo becuase it goes against the first game, exploration was significantly reduced. Miss some of the puzzle games that were introduced to in the last game (ME2). Also you seem to need to switch between disc a lot more than in Mass Effect 2 Multiplayer: Fun. No PvP, all PvE. Focus's on teamwork. Biggest complaint is the ""Store"". All new characters and weapons are random with different pack just increasing your odds. Unfortunately you don't know what items, weapons or characters are Common, Uncommon, Rare, or Ultra Rare. Bugs: A few but Significant Most notable the face import issue for characters created in Mass Effect 1 and 2. None of my characters faces I generated imported into Mass Effect 3. Even post patch, just released 4/11, imported in properly. Many gamer have experienced items being re-lock in multiplayer and game freezes.

norse,"Oh, man. So bad. The ending is horrible, but you already know that if you haven't been living under a rock. I couldn't have been worse if ""it had all been a dream"", it couldn't have been worse if everyone spontaneously broke into song for the grand finale of ME - the musical episode. Or if they'd just had the wisdom to cut out the last 20 minutes. That said, that's not why I am rating this a 0. The gameplay suffered badly from ME1 and even ME2: the main story skeleton is an unbelievable gimmick, and off that hang side missions that are at best so-so, with no choice in dialog and pretty bad animation (I mean, really, the running female Shepard?!) The side missions frequently have inconsistencies (characters appearing/disappearing, physically unlikely scenarios (someone should educate the writers about mass and energy, and how if I spent half an hour defeating a mech that can kill me with one shot, a cutscene that shows everyone standing in an open shuttle looking at said mech pointing his guns at me but not shooting for a minute is pretty stupid). I won't whine about how this could have been a great game, but it's sad to see how cheaply and easily this game could have been ten times as good.

ZacOfTheZombies,"Mass Effect 3 presents a text book example of ""Just finish it so we can sell it."" The game is riddled with cut corners; Be it sprites in the game, stock photos, plot holes deep enough to fit the Reaper Armada in, and content cut from the finished product, everything combines to paint ME3 as a sloppy, unfinished product. The gamplay is the average coverbased shooter that ME is known for. The RPG elements for the game are surprisingly better since ME2, more reminiscent of those found in ME1. The writing in the game is, like I said earlier, riddled with plotholes but still offers fleeting moments of genuine goodness which makes me wonder if someone else was in charge of them. And of course, there's the ending. Pre-release comments stated that ME3's ending wouldn't be just ""an A, B, or C choice"" and that ""player choices would really matter"", these statements are completely false. The game ends based on a final A, B, or C choice resulting in virtually identical endings, differing only in color.

LanLan,"Despite the general uproar, Mass Effect 3 has proven to be a fantastic end to a beloved series. The upset over the ending is justified, albeit largely uncalled for. The central conflict present in each of the previous games largely revolves around the animosity between synthetics and organics. While many have ignored this particular aspect of the series, the ending wholly resolves it, in a largely satisfying way. Despite this, the widely held belief that the ending is too linear is a valid one. However, Bioware is already working on new content that would hopefully present players with more options, and thus, more satisfaction. As for the rest of the game, Mass Effect 3 is a total and complete triumph. The gameplay is impecable, the presentation is spotless, and the mix of RPG elements from Mass Effect 1 and the explosive action of Mass Effect 2 results in an incredibly immersive experience. Ignore the many dissenters, frustrated by the fact that the game doesn't spell everything out for you. Leaving loose ends allows for players to create their own possibilities, a fundamental concept and a throwback to traditional role playing games. Bioware - keep doing what you do best. 10/10.",10,2012-04-13,XBOX 360,user
f_type,"""The people who are crying about the ending are overreacting,"" was my initial impression while I was still working my way through this game while having to read a forum post, website update, or blog about fan outcry about the end of the game. As I was still playing through the mid-point of the game, I thought it was fantastic. The visuals and sound are great, the combat is fantastic, and everything you love about the series is better than ever. You'll encounter some epic moments, and see all of your decisions come to fruition. My only issue, up to that point, was some outcomes were nearly impossible to change, and were based on some of the most mundane decisions made earlier in this game or in the two prior games. I thoroughly enjoyed the game... until the final moments. Unfortunately, I learned that the fans weren't overrating. The ending is, simply put, bad. In fact, I would go so far as to say it was one of the worst endings I've ever seen in my 2 decades of gaming (yes, including those old ""Congratulations! You beat the game!"" endings). For all the talk of decisions and choices, the final moments of the game were simply hollow and the ending was anything but an ending, full of plot holes and unanswered questions. For a series that spanned 3 excellent games (minus the end of this game), I was baffled as to how BioWare felt that the final parts of the game were at all satisfactory. I know I'm just preaching to the choir here, but it's all true. Mass Effect 3 was simply fantastic, until the final moments.",7,2012-04-12,XBOX 360,user
Jayosh,"Mass Effect has been an extremely amazing series, and Bioware hyped this game as the extremely exciting climax to the series. I think they deliver to a certain degree. I want to praise the actual combat in this game and even though people are whining about the lack of RPG elements I do think it's still a very fun system. It also does a really good task at dealing with a lot of the perpetual issues presented in both 1 and 2 (Krogan genophage, Geth quarian relationship, etc.). I would want to get the game after reading what I said its just, so half finished. No clue how Bioware put so little work into this game and still took so long. There are some GREAT story missions, very exciting. It's just everything else is so rushed. This game fails to appease the newcomers of the series and even the veterans who love this series with a burning passion. Interested in this game? Play Mass Effect 1 & 2 they are great games.

nickobom,"The game at all is reasonable but the Ending DESTROYS everything. All choices along ME1 and ME2 really doesn't matter... the ME2 choices about collector base etc .. they are ignored. BioWare said that would be 16 different endings, but what we got was 3 different colors. RED BLUE or GREEN. There is no narrative coherence, the ending is filled with plot holes, ME1 and ME2 story was destroyed in a matter of minutes, they doesn't review their own games before launching? This doesn't make sense really. Why am I giving a 0? The answer is: The ending not only destroyed ME3 but the story of ME1 and ME2 too. ME3 became a action-shooter, there is only auto-dialogue, a few choices that i can count with my fingers. The game forces you to do some things, there is no roleplay anymore. I won't talk about the plotholes because in youtube you can find a lot of videos highlighting everyone one of them. They have done the same thing with DA2, they are trying to reach another kind of gamers, but to do that they are sacrificing their own fanbase. ME3 feels exactly like DA2: RUSHED. They didn't had the time to review their own creation what a crap! Hire another writer. Only your writers can screw a incredible story like ME in a matter of seconds. If I wanted to play make a Gears of War i would bought GoW. BioWare and EA are destroying every game they have. I feel sorry for them and for us cause we are losing a great developer.

Every decision I've made throughout the series felt like they mattered and I saw the effects of these choices show throughout the story being told. I often found myself doing nothing more but wandering around overhearing conversations that told even more about the story. The story is epic, well acted, and immersing. The game-play is better than ever and caters to many play styles. Like stealth, hitting hard and running away? Go for it. Standard FPS? Sure. Like the Rock/Paper/Scissor decisions of a classic RPG? You have skills for that. The negative attitudes about downloadable content and a disappointing close to one of the greatest gaming accomplishments of all time is a shame.

SGRevan,"The Mass Effect trilogy receives it's latest and last chapter. After starting up the game I immediately noticed big differences. You have 'less say' in the dialogue options. Comparing it to Mass Effect 1 it's a huge leap backwards. Why would you take away something that made the first one so great?! Don't get me wrong, you still have times where you have to choose between outcome A or B, and believe me when I say that those choices are immensely difficult, that because you realy care about the characters and story... also Mass Effect 3 hugely improved on the combat system, it's near perfect. You realy enjoy using the weapons and powers to take town hordes of enemies... this all on a great galactic scale while explosion and reaper invasion-sounds hurl around you. Epic, I'd say. The Multiplayer has this great combat aswel, minus the epicness that you get in the single-player ofc. ... After having several friends telling me the ending is completely out of place... I finally got to the end. I have to say, it's not THAT bad... It's still epic and the climax is there! ... but I do have to agree, it gives no closure on Shepard or everyone else around him/her. Mass Effect 3 is a great game, you notice the hard labor that Bioware made for making this title, and the Original Score + the graphical design and presentation makes this one hell of a trip into the sci-fi universe of Mass Effect. So all in all, I know the ending could've been much better, but since EA announced they will give us more closure in the near future, I believe it will make this game jump that one step higher on my personal scoreboard.",9,2012-04-08,XBOX 360,user
DANNOMAN_88,"OK- had to review this, just finished the game, and then looked at all of the bad reviews, had to throw in my 2 cents. This game is not a 0 or a 1 - not a 10, but a very good game. I suspect everyone giving it a 0 or 1 mostly hated losing a loved character that they invested so much time in and the ENDING. To me, the game felt similar to ME2, but more dramatic and BIG - I was blown away with some of the impact this game had. I really enjoyed it. I can understand how people did not like the ending, but this was a story arc that was planned from the beginning, and I can accept that the developer decided that the story arc ended like this. If Shepherd was able to live, I guess that people would be giving it a similar score to ME2. I overlooked some of the cheesiness and warts that the game has, and enjoyed the journey. I give it an edge over ME2. On one hand - much better combat, and real emotional impact for me. One the other hand - poorer writing, less free will, and some unnecessary searches for random 'war assets' that only took away from the game. THE GOOD: 1. The cinematic quality was very good. 2. The battles and action is so much better than ME1 and 2, where I felt battles were not as good as the role-playing elements. Every battle in ME3 felt felt exciting and like I had some valid options. The diverse enemies kept me on my toes. I was stuck early in the game on Regular difficulty, redoing a battle like 10 times, until I got used to the new more realistic battles, and then I was able to play most of it on a harder difficulty, and I really enjoyed the fights, instead of just trying to get through them to get back to the story. 3. Throughout much of the game, my actions from ME2 and ME3 MATTERED - I was SO pissed off and emotionally invested when my actions from the games turned out to wipe out a group of people in the game and had one of my members commit suicide. I was really upset, but that really added to the idea that my actions have ramifications. Wow, I at the time I thought that I was doing the right things, but in hindsight I could see how my decisions led to the bad result. THE BAD: 1. Too short. 2. The game does take away some control - your character has less leeway - the story and the cinematic quality of the game sacrifice some free will. 3. EA's and MSoft's money grubbing ways. I will rarely play a new game - I will play a used copy most of the time. I will never buy downloadable content on XBL for this game or another game. I will probably never pay to play games on XBL. Why? Horrible value! I don't want to be bled dry by the greedy big names. Look at the appstore model - a bunch of free and affordable entertainment.

Same engine, same graphics, nearly same gameplay--so all that would improve or stay status quo is plot/story, where they failed miserably. False advertising in that ""choices would matter. Ending would not be A, B, or C."" Bioware asked for feedback, then ignored it and will release free DLC extending the ending, yet fixing nothing. I cannot recommend this game to anyone.

DavidB,"Despite the general critical acclaim, I thought this was a terribly disappointing game. I loved the first two Mass Effect games - the second one is an absolute masterpiece - and it's baffling how Bioware - who got everything so right in Mass Effect 2 - could get so many things wrong in this final part of the series. The focus is on combat - and other aspects of the game have suffered. Gone is the feeling of freedom and expansiveness of having a whole galaxy to explore - aside from main quest missions, there are no planets on which you can land, no hidden adventures to discover. And too many of the main quest missions felt unremarkable to me, indistinguishable from each other, and at times it was hard to care about what was going on. The way that side missions have been implemented in the game feels very unsatisfactory and doesn't feel fully realised at all. Don't even get me started on the way the journal works - or doesn't work; it's virtually impossible to stay on top of what you need to do, or where you need to go to do it. Item management is also a nightmare: you need to buy weapons in the game, but you're buying them in the dark, because the game offers nothing as useful as being able to compare what's on sale with the weapons your squad already has. Item management, quest management, the way that side missions work, all felt poorly realised to me. There are no new characters - oh no, sorry, there's one: a hulking space marine whose name I've forgotten he's so unremarkable. He's like a cast-off from Gears of War, dull as dishwater, as out of place in a Mass Effect game as Jack Bauer would be in an episode of The Wire. It's not all bad - the game does throw up some memorable moments, and it looks stunning - the graphics and lighting effects are excellent. But there are not enough memorable moments, and too much of the game feels like a betrayal of all that has gone before it. Mass Effect 3 feels like a game trying to be all things to all people, and ending up as a bit of a dog's breakfast. If I'm being honest, this game broke my heart.

BioWare (now publicly maligned, but still undisputed kings of the RPG) finally got the weapon/armor customisation and resource finding to the point of being fun, the combat was more streamlined and gorgeous than ever (biotic detonations will always make me squeal with delight), and pretty much every mission I was emotionally rocked. Mass Effect stands as one of the best series of games I have played, and this was the best of the three. Admittedly, I did initially take the stance - like everyone else - of denouncing the game after experiencing the ending . Upon first impressions it came off as rushed, flawed and meaningless, leading me to become one of the fans that fell under the spell of the infamous ""indoctrination theory"" that floated around. It is a hopeful alternative to the Occam's razor that BioWare didn't put enough effort into the ending as they should have. It was definitely a disappointment video-game wise, but was also rich with existential arguments which had me pondering/arguing with friends for days after. In the end I'm not hating it as much as I thought I would. Regardless, it doesn't ruin the rest of the series - as everyone seems to be saying - or even the rest of the game, which remains one of the most exhilarating gaming experiences of recent memory. And the multiplayer isn't too shabby either!",9,2012-04-06,XBOX 360,user

guillermop,"Mass Effect 3 is the culmination of all your adventures as Commander Shepard. Unfortunately, Bioware screwed the pooch with the worst ending to anything ever. All your choice in the first two games? Irrelevant! Did you want to feel a sense of triumph? Too bad, you get to choose between lime, blueberry and cherry flavors. On top of it all, the hacks at Bioware defend this steaming pile with claims of ""artistic integrity"". EA (the worst company in america!) lets its PR dogs out, to get companies to call gamers entitled. The only positive to come out of the fiasco of this game is the farce of gaming ""journalism"" has been exposed Multiplayer is designed to frustrate you into spending money, unlike other games where you choose your unlocks, or are rewarded for play style , you're at the mercy of a random number generator here.

That said, the ending does not render the rest of the journey null and void. The 30-odd hours it'll take your Shepard to reach the conclusion of this game rank amongst the most memorable experiences in gaming history. Wonderfully fleshed-out characters, beautiful alien worlds and a rich universe have always been trademarks of the series... and the ending does little to diminish the fact that the Mass Effect trilogy is one of the best sci-fi properties ever created.

The action in this part has improved over the second one, the graphics look better and the story is still top notch. While playing the game, i noticed my options (choices) were less than the other parts, but I didn't find it to be a big problem. The thirty or so hours were great, until I got til the ending... Sadly but true, the series took a dive I couldn't have seen coming. The ending felt unfinished, non sensical and just plain out of place. Normally, I replay the Mass Effect series multiple times.

1234worm,"Get it straight, Mass Effect 3 is mainstream. It's not going to have meticulous weapon and armor switching, it's not going to have open unstructured environments, it's going to be heavy-handed and blunt at times, It's depiction of relationships is blunt to put it kindly. It's going for mass appeal. ME3 is built to be accessible and fun. You'll be killing enemies in style until the ridiculous upswing in difficulty for the final few waves of enemies. All the characters play it a little too straight and the narrative isn't quite as enrapturing as ME2, but this is made up for by your ability to influence the game-world. The effects of your choices from past games are a little underwhelming, but the pay-offs for plot points from the past games like the genophage and the quarian geth conflicts are excellent. While the missions have never been more linear some of the areas, particularly those levels that take place during reaper attacks or the the climax on tuchanka are breathtakingly large in scope. There's a futility to what you are trying to do throughout and this is reinforced by these scenes of chaos and destruction. Mass Effect 3 is to the point, with smartly designed levels (i don't think i ever came close to getting lost) and refined cover based shooting, as always powers are way cooler (if you want to have fun play vanguard). The combat has never been better, although easy, it's never unwelcome. The stories are meaningful, the characters feel real. the games never played better. It's not going to be the complex rpg shooter bioware once promised (the way they makes games has changed a lot since KOTOR), but it is a different take on cover based shooters that for me is way more fun than gears of war. The ending is the most important ending of a video game, ever. i've never cared about the end **** this much. Even though it's a bit of a Sopranos ending, it's gotten a similar media swell to that ending and they do say that any press is good press. I don't really think it's good to end your story with something so controversial it creates an uproar from your most loyal fans but even if you hate the ending you have to admit no other ending would have brought this kind of attention. I've been obsessed enough with the ending that I wrote this entire review, full of important points, as fast as I possibly could so I could talk about the ending. I've never been so consumed by the ending ****. Bioware are either idiots, or the most despicable geniuses in the history of video games. Either they see a thematic reason to make the end of their final game contradict everything the series has ever been about, or they're geniuses who came up with the greatest twist ending of a video game and challenged the idea of what games could achieve as an art form. of course if they are geniuses and the games final message to the player, which promises future content, was the first step of their diabolical plan they have destroyed video games claim to status as an art form by excluding the true ending of the series in an attempt to make more money by selling it as DLC. Even if they decide to give it away it will only prove that they felt for remorse for what was going to be the most mind-bending thing to happen in a videogame. So evil geniuses or idiots, either way, it's a game you have to play.",9,2012-04-03,XBOX 360,user
Noobara,"Mass Effect 3 is for the most part a brilliant game and manages to balance RPG elements and Shooter mechanics even better than its predecessors. The story is for 99% of the game fantastic and concludes many of the story lines from the first 2 games. The most talked about flaw with the game is it's poor ending. the one everyone is going on about and rating the game so poorly because of. Yes the ending is not Bioware's finest moment of story telling and it might spoil the experience slightly for many people, but it should not completely put you off playing what is such a good game for the previous 30 hours of gameplay. The other major flaw with the game is that many of the characters from ME2 are strangely absent, and it would have been nice for them to feature more. Especially for PS3 owners who have less attachment to the ME1 characters than X-Box owners. Although the game lets it self down at the very end its still a game everyone should play - however its best played after completing the other 2 games as you will be far more attached to the story if you've already spent hours with Shepherd and his/her crew.",8,2012-04-03,XBOX 360,user

Balrock,"Overall one of the best rpgs ever created. No other series or game has forced me to sit there and think about the consequences of my decisions like this one. I even spent 20 minutes explaining the backstory of a decision to my girlfriend to get her opinion on what was the right thing to do. No matter what the haters of the ending say, they all played the game to the ending for a reason. They loved the series and enjoyed this game enough to see it's conclusion. The action points are fun and tense, the return of multiple previous teammates is entertaining, even the resource gathering mini-game from previous entries has been further improved to not make it so boring/repetitive. Overall, this game is an improvement in every area from the previous entries. As for the ending, I think lots of people are confusing anger at the ending vs. not having multiple endings. I believe the presented ending is well written and a nice conclusion to the series. I won't argue that there are some portions of the ending that are not well explained but I leave that up to Bioware to explore in future DLC and Mass Effect releases. However most people seem to be upset because no matter what you've done in the previous games, it minimally affects the outcome. This is a valid complaint but not one that should earn the scorn and purposefully low ratings this game has received. As for the multiplayer, I found it to be entertaining but ultimately very repetitive with later difficulty levels being set a little too high. The baseball card pack way of upgrading your gear is good in that it keeps you coming back for more and prevents you from obtaining and maxing out the best guns too early. However I swear that they purposely coded it so that you don't receive upgrades to guns you actually use. This can lead to grinding and frustration as you attempt to get the one gun/upgrade that your pining for. Added to this frustration is the difficulty of the gold difficulty levels. Gold difficulty is set up so that it can only be beat in one of two ways. Method one: obtain 3 dedicated friends, you all level your characters to max level, and then you all obtain the maximum level in the best guns in the game. This will give you less than a 50% chance to beat gold. Method two: One person goes as a specific race of a specific class, you fight a specific enemy in a specific spot on a specific level, and you manipulate the game design based on the abilities of that one class. This will give you a 75% chance of beating gold. Since the first method requires the highest levels of the best guns you're pigeon-holed into doing the second method so many times you get burnt out until you don't want to play anymore. So a good first attempt at multiplayer but definitely needs work.",10,2012-04-03,XBOX 360,user
Notonlytheend,"This is a true disappointment. It would be easy to blame a generic deus ex rip off ending for my disappointment or day 1 DLC that was poorly handled. Or even the insulting ABC choices that lead to the same cut scenes. In reality, the problems come from a shift in design and goals of a company that once triumphed the greatest RPG's the world has ever seen. It's a problem of sacrificing what you're best at not for the sake of innovation, but for the sake of being more appealing. When this happens, the little things that make a game great get missed. For instance, Mass Effect moved from twelve squadmates to six (unless you bought the DLC so I'm not counting it). This was supposed to give greater conversation in the mission and lead to a more intense interaction. But that was not the case. Further, when you do re-encounter old squadmates, they don't even join you for a single mission. They may follow you around the citadel, but never do you get the full interaction; it feels rushed and forced. Another major loss is that of actual side missions. Where once I traveled to planets and few to the surface to retrieve key items, I now scan a planet while reaper chase me like the ghosts from Pac-man. There's no exploration. Multiplayer was obviously tacked on to prevent us from selling the game back. But most insulting of all is the fact that Bioware lied. Straight up, unmistakably lied. They promised no ABC ending and that's what they gave us. They promised complete resolution and they left thing purposefully cryptic. It's not the fact that they did these things; it's that they lied. ""There are many different endings. We wouldnâ",4,2012-04-03,XBOX 360,user

I have to say I just don't get the criticism of the ending. I thought it was pretty poignant and kind of logical. I'm not going to add spoilers. I was sorry to lose one particular person earlier on in my play thru but it's about hard choices in war isn't it? So the game, it's nearly as good as ME2, there are way more weapon options which I liked tho. I tended to stick with the modded geth assault rifle tho the Chakram thrower from playing the koatr demo was also cool. So it was an epic run thru, my 6 year old son was invested in it too, he thought he was watching a movie, I have to drop some kudos on the multiplayer too, the first 2 weeks or so with the game I spent on that as it's very well executed and very enjoyable, check it out if you haven't. My major criticism of the game as a whole is it's too short, I like how the mini games to pick locks etc have gone, but I'm in two minds about mining etc being streamlined.

Allthegoodones,"So I had been following all the hype around this game prior to its release and had bought into it all because, and I'm certain even the disappointed will agree, this was by far the most engaging video game ever made. Even ME 3 was an amazing experience, the whole quarian vs geth storyline and the conclusion of it was easily the most powerful sub plot in a game i've ever experienced. The ending though... what a grumble inducing affair it was! It was clearly rushed... even if this had been a single game that ending would not have sufficed. Bur for a trilogy, its down right criminal to end with a five minute cut scene. There had to have been a fully playable epilogue chapter. Shepard's death in itself wasn't the disappointment it was more the callousness with which this legend we had been building for years was abandoned is what broke all the hearts. Shepard dying is a fitting option for sure, adding invaluably to the replayability of the whole series. But bioware seriously needed to take a leaf from the RDR book wherein the protag dies in the penultimate chapter allowing for closure for the ones left behind. Ofcourse for those players who managed to make the decision throughout the series to keep Shepard alive in the end would be awarded with shepard as the Protag of the final/epilogue chapter as well. Alas, Bioware has dropped the ball on that opportunity and even if they come out with a DLC fixing this problem it will not hold the same value or meaning. Having said that, the game itself is remarkable and kudos to Bioware for undertaking this mystifying journey and bringing us along for the ride. In all honesty the plotline of the ME series has never been as strong as the subplots and relationships and feeling of camaraderie that the game was able to bring to players and as far as those attributes are concerned, let me just say that even though i sided with the geth initially, the very next day, after a sleepless night haunted by visions of Tali's heartbreaking death, i simply had to go back and kill the geth of instead. And its not just Tali... Garruss, and Liara... Mordin and Wrex... Ashley and Miranda and joker and Kelly and even EDI... these were more than just team mates, they were real friends who my shepard cared about and who cared about him. No one has ever been able to do that before, it is a feeling exclusive to the ME series and a feeling that i will crave to feel again until someone take the ME formula and improves on it to deliver a the masterpiece this game was until they botched up the climax. All in all, it was one hell of an experience and it would have been all that much better had Bioware given the time and effort to the ending that this game deserved. Even so i'm grateful for the effort they did put in. Now they need to work on a new ME series, one set in the aftermath of this one. They need to do it soon and they need to do it right.",8,2012-04-01,XBOX 360,user

The gameplay, visuals, soundtrack, etc. are all top notch. Bioware didn't deviate much from ME2, but they sure did put on an excellent display for the fans. I think the majority of people that have issues with the ending are just not getting the big picture. ""Disowning"" Bioware... one of the funniest things I've seen or heard in my entire life. Nonsense. Move on! It's a video game, a form of leisure time activity, entertainment, a form of art, it's not a law or a living thing or a crisis. If I had a dollar for every time I was ""disappointed"" about a form of entertainment and I carried on the way the ""cause"" did, I'd be filthy rich.

Seeing as this game was always about narrative, the story seems to have thinned out ten fold with the most important aspect of the game now seemingly being the shooter, i never played mass effect to kill hordes of the enemy, that always bored the hell out of me, but that is all this game throws at you, I found that i would often change from hardcore to casual just because of the length of time it was taking to fight the hordes, i wanted a well writen story not a shooter. If i had wanted to aimlessly kill hordes of enemy i would have played dead island or some other shooter. Now the ending ruined the previous 2 games for me i feel like it makes everything a bit pointless and futile because realisticlly you had no chance of changing anything meaning all of your previous decisions are void as such. I am yet to play multiplayer all though I hear it is good so fingers crossed it will make up for one of the worse and most dissapointing narratives of a single player game for the last many months.",4,2012-03-30,XBOX 360,user
fmb,"I think the game has moments of greatness, but overall, I feel like it is sloppy, incomplete, and worst of all, uninspired. The lack of legitimate side quests (only six N7 missions, all with very little variety in tone, plot, and scenery), the complete removal of any form of exploration, the thinness of dialogue options and prevalence of auto dialogue, the lack of conversation with companions, the limited use of ME2 squadmates, the fetch quest system ala Dragon Age 2, and the incoherent and lackluster ending all make this a frustrating and disappointing game. I expected Mass Effect to go out with a bang, but instead I feel like it just stumbled to an unsatisfying conclusion. It could have been a lot more than it was.",4,2012-03-29,XBOX 360,user

ZenBiker,"ME3 is the sad end **** series. And I don't mean the now-infamous ending of the final Mass Effect game. I mean a series of games from Baldur's Gate, to KotOR, to the first two installments of the Mass Effect trilogy.. I mean the end of BioWare's run as the pre-eminent storyteller in electronic gaming. Many Metacritic users have written fantastic ME3 negative reviews, so I'm not going to elaborate on those. I recommend traveler's review dated March 29, 2012; it's one of the best examples I've seen. My bottom line: ME3 was destroyed by a Reaper--not Harbinger, but ****. ****, who has no passion for story or character. I mean **** the Money ****.",2,2012-03-29,XBOX 360,user
Huey_Freeman,"'m not a big fan of Mass Effect 3's ending. I thought it was convoluted and anticlimactic for anticlimatic's sake. Though a lot of about the ending actually does work. I loved the fade out while I was rushing down to the last destroyer with my brother's in arms. I loved the fade in to Shephard badly injured and slowly walking towards her/his destiny awaiting him/her deep inside of The Citadel. I loved Anderson and Shepard communicating for opposite ends of The Citadel discussing what was going on. The long walk way up into The Illusive Man's secret hideout. It was all very atmospheric and epic and kind of beautiful. I thought the paragon/rendegade prompts were good as well during the ""standoff"". And I actually liked the twist that the little boy was The Catalyst. But the 3 choices he gives you were indeed pretty lame. And the lack of exposition following said decision was just plain bad. You can't end a game that encompasses over 140 hours of gameplay and millions of decisions made by the player with just 3 crew members walking off of the Normandy and just cut to the credits....EVEN IF you're planning on releasing DLC. There is a lot of room for criticism for that horrible decision made by whoever at Bioware that made it. I can't believe that ending got all the way to the final product. Its actually kind of sad. But, it DID NOT ruin the game or the series for me. Because it wasn't the fact that Shephard was destined to die (or **** still don't know do we) that actually is kind of good when you think about it. Its life. Sometimes no matter what decisions you make you can't fight your fate and what is going to be is just going to be. Your destiny is something you must embrace. Which is why I chose the middle option and made Shephard sacrifice herself. Yes, HERSELF. Female Shephard is a MILLION TIMES better than male Shephard and I'm a dude. From the voice acting (Jennifer Hale is amazing and the guy voices male Shepard is very boring) to character design she is just so much more fun to play with. Seriously if you haven't played the games thru with Fem Shep you are doing yourself a HUGE disservice as I have found the game way better controlling her. But back to 3, the game is incredible. There are so many jaw-dropping moments and sheer brilliance (if you haven't played thru with the From Ashes DLC you are missing out on what I find to be the best addiction to the game - Javik and his story). The improvements in shooting and offensive strategy are borderline limitless. And I had a remarkable experience playing the game. To think someone can really give this game a 0-5 based off the ENDING ALONE is proposterous. Are you guys really even Mass Effect fans? Or narcissists?",10,2012-03-29,XBOX 360,user
GibsonJunkie,"I've really enjoyed this game. The graphics look great. I was able to import my save files from ME1 and 2. The combat is upgraded, and feels even smoother than in the second. The ending, which most people have a problem with, I actually really liked. I felt like as the game moved along, loose ends were being tied together while the plot still advanced, and characters met their end (or not!) based purely on my actions. Honestly, my main complaint is being forced to run around with my gun out nearly the entire time, and some occasional issues during combat when I was unable to take cover for some unknown reason. Overall, I'll give this game a 9/10, for a few technical bugs, but an overwhelmingly intriguing plot, and a high replay value. Thanks for reading!",9,2012-03-29,XBOX 360,user
Babachewie,Best game I've ever played. People are just trolling cause most people are dumb and things easily go over their heads.

These people think they're entitled to whatever they want. It's not their game. The didn't make it. So screw em.

traveler,"Let me preface this by saying that I was a long time fan of the series and of Bioware games in general; I played both ME1 and ME2 dozens of times over the years (no exaggeration!), and KOTOR until my eyes bled (ok, slight exaggeration; but not by much). So it really does pain me to give this game such a low score. The short of it is: the game is rushed and incomplete. Corners were obviously cut all about, and it shows. Most notably in the classical RPG elements of story and exploration. The long of it: in ME3 what you see is that Bioware/EA are quite obviously trying to appeal to the massive consumer base that loves shooter games. Great (and in a sense so was ME1). But the results are that a great deal of time seemed to have been spent copying shooter elements from other games, in an effort to create a fairly mediocre corridor shooter experience, with wonky controls. The glaring thing is what is gone with all this effort. Exploration. Astounding that a game that markets itself as as RPG has so little of it. There are limited hubs, much smaller than those in the previous installments, that provide little interaction for engaging with the world. NPC interaction is either highly scripted, as in, no the player doesn't choose what to say; or it just is a matter of eavesdropping on two people talking in order to get a quest that actually doesn't contain any gaming elements other than go here on the map and press a button. Old RPG standards like equipment and journal logs are streamlined to the point of being non-existent (the journal in particular is totally inept and incomplete; it doesn't update or provide you useful information on the quests - a real step down from the previous games). Why? Well, because the game appears to be trying to force you into a linear narrative. In other words, the whole 'choose your own adventure' motif of the brand has taken a backseat for brief corridor shooting experiences punctuated by lengthy cut scenes with limited interaction. Think Gears of War, only worse (and that is saying something!). The plan to do this is so blatant that the game actually has options to switch it from an RPG to a straight story-shooter, right there on its opening screen. What is most glaring in this rushed and incomplete experience is the real drop in story telling. Now it is no secret that Bioware was purchased by EA, and that some fans were concerned about how that would effect the culture of the company. But it also is no secret that the people writing this game are not the same ones who wrote the first. And it shows. Lore is forgotten, conversations seem forced, character development can be childish, etc. Its like they inherited a world to write and imagine in that they either didn't understand, or didn't care about. I'm not sure which is worse. And don't get me started on that ending.... OK, DO get me started on that ending. It's here that the evidence of how quickly and with such little care the game was cobbled together is most glaring. Some people have complained that the ending lacks choice (true), and closure (also true), or is confusing (not so much; somebody apparently copied Deus Ex). But the most repugnant aspects of the ending are just how lazy it is. Reused cut scenes, short, simplified conversation options. The whole thing smacks of 'rush it out the door, we have a deadline!' And back to the writers not being the same crop or the same caliber, the ending also doesn't seem to be connected with the rest of the series either in ideas or themes. You remember 'dark energy'? You know, the raison d'etre for Tali's presence on Haestrom, as well as mentioned at other parts of ME2 (like Illium). There was this whole big setup for 'dark energy' throughout ME2, it was foreshadowed as being of some galactic importance. And in ME3. Nada. Nothing. Zilch. The storyline was just abandoned and forgotten. Oops. No dark energy concerns here. This smacks of just lazy writing, and inept plotting. (Rumor has it that this was originally to be a part of the buildup for the conclusion - a connection between the middle act of the trilogy and its finale. But was abandoned for.... who knows. Instead you get a series of rushed deus ex machina developments. And then, over.) It pains me as a longtime fan and customer of bioware to see how little regard they have for quality here. That was the brand really, immersive RPGs with engaging, high adventure stories. That apparently is not the brand anymore. I don't know what is. Finally, I think I should point out the discrepancy between the 'professional critics' and 'user reviews' here and elsewhere. This is amazing. The reasons for the discrepancy are unclear, but I think the ramifications are going to be long reaching. The central question (for me at least) is one of trust: Is there any spirit of consumer protection left in software review or is it just caveat emptor, and have a nice day?",1,2012-03-29,XBOX 360,user
Weremutt,"I have severally mixed feelings about this game. ME1 was one of the best games I have ever played to date with all of the different options that a character has. Granted the cover and combat system was not too good, but the story was incredible and gripping. Once I finished the game I would always start another character to play with. ME1 was not perfect by any means, but it was still an incredible game. I have gone back an played ME1 again since ME3 came out and I still enjoyed it more. I liked the writing a lot more and how the story pulled you in. ME2 did away with a lot of things but still allowed for a lot of conversation/story telling/ and choices that a character could make. The combat was improved, weapons and armor were stripped out. But the game was still good. The story line was still grabbing but not nearly as much as ME1. It was highly character driven through your squad. The enemy and allied AI was greatly improved over ME1. I did not like the auto dialogue that took place with Zaeed or Kasumi. I felt it was a cope-out by the developers. ME3 did one thing right that the other games did not have nearly as well and that was combat. I felt that the combat in the game was just about flawless. I could not have asked for more in the combat department. The inventory was a great improvement. The game really lets a person customize how they want Shepard and their squad to play. I felt that allied AI was much worse in ME3 then ME2 and was on level of ME1. Most of the time I found my squad doing nothing except ducking for cover or standing out in the open in the middle of a fire fight. Enemy AI was improved but for some reason on the hardcore difficulty which is what I always play on, I felt the game was way too easy. I died twice on my first play through. In the other 2 games I died much more then that on hardcore. I felt the game was way to easy and it could have been more difficult. I still enjoyed playing the game but not nearly as much as I did the other two. The conversation choices were just not there. The majority of them only gave you two options and barely anything to ask. Your decisions from the first two games were almost non-existent. The majority of your squad from the second game was reduced to cameo roles which is just wrong. They all should have gotten a mission were you went into combat with them again. They should have all been there at the final mission as a major task force. While the writing was greatly improved upon from the other two games in terms of delivery of lines, there was not enough selectable conversation between squad members. The majority of your conversations came from EDI, Vega, Javik (if you had bought a collectors edition or the DLC). Honestly they should have brought back the elevator scenes for the squad banter. I never disliked them. I actually enjoyed them. It was something different and new and there was barely ever any loading screens. You had something to listen too while the game loaded. There was way too much auto-dialogue and I felt that it pulled away from the game. The character import for the third game is horribly broken and i hope they fix it soon. Only one of my characters imported over correctly. Thankfully Bioware has stated they are working on a fix and it is on the testing phase. The game has a lot of glitches and I feel that it was actually rushed. I wish they could have spent more time on it. For those that have completed the game they know that there is only one true ending with a true resolution which is kind of wrong. I will not get into it but lets just say that Shepard has spent too much time around the Reapers and Reaper artifacts. I did like the way the game ended, I am not always a fan of happy endings and I knew this trilogy was not going to have one. War never has a happy outcome. Mass Effect 1 was easily a 10/10 for me even with the broken combat/inventory system. Mass Effect 2 was a 9/10. The removal of inventory and the addition of ammo made the game not nearly as good. I give ME3 a 7/10 because of all of the negative features which I have listed for the game. While the game was fun to play, I never played Mass Effect for the combat. If I wanted to play a game for combat I would play some battlefield or gears of war. There was simply just too much wrong with it for me. It took too much away from the experience and immersion factor of the trilogy. I now know why so many people have left Bioware since the game went gold. They knew the game was not up too par and had a lot of flaws. They do not want to be associated with a substandard product again. I would not pay full retail of $59.99 for this game. It is honestly not worth it. I would wait for the $39.99 price drop. I thought Skyrim was a better game then this and that game has a lot of problems and it is not even a style of game that I like too much.

The good : Great Story, humour, acting, great graphics, surprisingly good multi player (-cover system), great musical score, great character realisation, improved accessibility, improved combat mechanics, great AI (at higher levels), properly hard mode.

WintersLMJ,"Despite the ending, BIOWARE put together another game that I fully engrossed myself in for two straight days. This game may not have had any new graphics, but it came with a plethora of weapons and gear which the Mass Effect 2 lacked. This game meshed ME1 and ME2 perfectly and the decisions felt as real as ever. The one blemish to this amazing game of course us the ending. As a true fan of anything BIOWARE, I can truly say that this is not enough to ruin a perfect score especially with the company re-writing the ending. It is TBD whether or not they will force you to pay money for said ""DLC"". But if i were BIOWARE, given the absolutely terrible feedback from FANS, i would think they would not charge. BUT EA is the overall leader and has the finals say in that matter. EA has had a bad history of being untrue to their fans. We'll see folks. Although the ending of ME2 is much more memorable, this game ended how it should have and will now have an even better ending with more closure. I think we can all thank BIOWARE for giving us such a great trilogy to remember (and still be playing over and over and again) for years to come. So, fans of the trilogy and BIOWARE, stop with the bad reviews, the game was glorious and the games will always be the best storyline I have ever experienced. So with that, I give this game an 11 out of 10 for effort on BIOWARE's behalf. Keep up the good work guys!",10,2012-03-28,XBOX 360,user
PopeDizzle,Everything you have come to enjoy and expect from mass effect. The gameplay is improved and the places you go feel alive. Multiplayer is a nice tack on fun to play with friends bad is its a pick up group. The game as a whole is fantastic...until it ends. I'm not going to down my score based on that alone but I will let be known that I hope Bioware does follow through and give their loyal fan base the ending they deserve. It's not a band wagon thing or trying to ruin their artistic integrity because I do believe games have become a form of art. I believe it is their right to tell their story the way they want. But a story is not a story without the final act. Bioware has done something amazing that no other game has done to date. Made a series when the player is so engaged and involved in a game that it has become the players story. That in itself is an accomplishment and it shows with the player backlash with the ending we were provided. So I recommend this game and the entire series to anyone. I have high hopes that Bioware will prove they are as loyal to their fans as their fans are to them and the Mass Effect universe.,9,2012-03-28,XBOX 360,user
Xenugears,"This game is simultaneously overrated and underrated. Overrated because critics and fanboys blindly gave the game a pass without addressing its glaring, near deal-breaking faults such as a curious lack of choice, wonky dialogue, a cumbersome cover system, vague journal entries, Jessica Chobot, James Vega, an inexcusable glitch not allowing me to import my Shepard from ME1 and 2 (really, Bioware?) and the now infamous ending. However, I would argue that ME3 is also slightly underrated because, well, the game STILL has solid combat, fun weapons (I love the Scorpion, a heavy pistol that shoots out sticky proximity mines), great music and a some genuinely rich emotional moments that strike a chord. The game's horrible conclusion and inability (or unwillingness) to weave ""my Shepard's"" actions from ME1 and 2 may not enough to ""ruin"" the game/series entirely and, for that matter, retroactively (a la Matrix Revolutions) but it's certainly enough to elicit a sense of regret over what could have been the best science fiction story of this current console generation (Portal 2 is safe!).

This game is a continuation and culmination of the story of Mass Effect 1 and 2, which has remained consistent and well told from the very first moments of ME1. All the ending requires of the player is that you as a player engage a little bit of your own depth and intellectual curiosity. If you are unable to engage those qualities, than you have bigger problems than being dissatisfied with the ending of the greatest space saga of the last 30 years. There are some minor flaws in my mind; forcing the player into ""multiplayer"", you really have to. And also some of the 'enhanced' cover mechanics are buggy, and don't work as they should.

jthiel09,"Although not perfect, it is far from the 1-4's that people are giving it. This game is a fantastic end to the trilogy in almost every aspect. Sure the story doesn't seem as in depth as the other two games, the decisions don't feel as though they mean as much but this is the last ride for Shepard. The decisions you make in this game must effect the game instantly as you are building up the forces to defeat the Reapers, not be sure to effect your character 3 games from now. Overall the music, pacing, graphics (little buggy) and game play are great. Add in the ability to mod your weapons again and this game has some great value to it. It may not be the end all to video games, but it is far from the lowest of the low scores some have given it. If you love the series and have are not childish in your demands for the perfect game you'll love this game.

It just seems incomplete, like chunks of story and quests were taken out of it - bet there will be a TON of DLC for this game. It IS a decent game but nowhere near the level of 1&2. The ending **** at first for me but after reading some of the theories out there if seems kinda cool.

Tokkas,"This is a stunning game, the ending aside. We all know it's not what we were promised, but people are allowing the ending to cloud their judgement of a massively proficient game. I admit I haven't touched the multiplayer (not my cup of tea), so I won't mention that in this review. There are other weak points, the picking up of random missions is a bit arbitrary, the reaper alertness every time you scan is annoying and James Vega is a waste of a squad space and a pointless character. I'd also like to point out that the Day 1 DLC was a bad idea, with one mission and a character that brings little to the game. But the good? The variety of enemies is much better than previous games, requiring different tactics to take them down. The combat is vastly improved from ME2, the enemy AI is a large part of this. They will flank you, lay down cover fire to protect weaker units and play to their own strengths. It's tougher all round and makes you feel like you are fighting for your survival every step of the way. The story is fantastic, if you enter into conversations with many of the NPC's you will see the decisions you made in previous stories and how they affect these character's reaction to you. And there are many of these previous characters to interact with. There are genuine twists and tragedies and in parts I was shocked, overjoyed and thrilled. So much work has gone into immersing you in this world and it is a rewarding experience. The ending is a weak point as I've said, but judging a game on this alone is unfair to the people who have produced it and those of us who didn't feel cheated. I actually felt hopeful that another story will follow, maybe not Shepherd and doubtful it will be called Mass Effect, but with some new ideas and set in the same universe.

Khimeran77,"I never trust the user side, so I thought i'd drop my two cents. Heres the thing, Mass Effect fans will give the most accurate assessment and newcomers will miss the point. The Mass Effect franchise, has added 3 things here, to make newcomers interested: multi-player, kinect and 2 new dumbed down ways to make you think that Mass Effect is not an rpg. You can now choose to play story mode, which makes gameplay super casual or you can choose shooter mode, which removes dialogue choices. If your rating Mass Effect 3, below a solid ""8,"" it is because you chose to play one of the 2 new modes. If you truly have an intrest in this amazing franchise, pick up a copy of the orginal. Going straight into ME3, means that you are buying it for multi-player, which is a bad reason. Now, I have played through the campaign 3 times and it is a must to experience, if you know what is going on. ME3 is straight up war, so it's a bit more straight foward, then it's predecessor, which had more character depth. Mass Effect 3 fits perfectly into the direction of the story. The complaints about the ending are valid though. It is a disappointing end to an epic journey. It did not ruin my experience. So if your a fan, then you already own ME3. If your low balling, it's because you are not playing the game the way it was intended to be played. I hear that it works well with motion controls though, but story or shooter modes just dumb down the experience. Mass Effect 3 is an awesome game, if you tend on investing into the entire story and your not looking to play anything but an rpg.",10,2012-03-28,XBOX 360,user
Sh0dan,"I went into this game extremely sceptical and critical because of the last game, which I hated. But I am happy to say that ME3 has made me a believer again. Its took me about a week to get through it all, and I still miss the deeper RPG elements, and planet exploration from ME1, but at the same time, I gotta admit, ME3 actually does feel like a return to form in many ways, and now that it can stand on its own two feet as a solid Third Person shooter comparable to GoW, its actually a pretty fun game. In fact it can get quite tactical on the harder difficult settings, due to the much smarter A.I. So game-play wise I was impressed. As for the ending, I quite liked it. It was a bit ambiguous, left open to interpretation, perhaps even too vague for some, but at the same time it did actually end, and thankfully, it wasnt your fan service, typical Hollywood ending in which everyone rides flies off into the sunset together. Instead it ended with some pretty big metaphysical questions about the purpose and evolution of life. So I was satisfied with the finality of it all, even if smaller individual questions didn't quite get the attention that some fans feel they deserved. Personally though, most of the story and characters arcs that I cared about did come to a conclusion during the course of the game, before the final push, so I didnt feel like there was much else left unanswered that bothered me. And really, the revelation at the end didn't leave much room for the smaller concerns. The bigger picture took priority. I think the developers set out to make the ending, open-ended. To encourage fans to examine the various endings and creatively discuss their meanings. Problem is, it seems many fans wanted a more closed ending. A final CGI cutscene with black and white conclusion to their personalised story, so that they wouldn't have to spend any more time pondering what it all meant. But that ending would have left less room for fan creativity and hypothesis. Which in my book would have been an uninteresting ending, because sci-fi is supposed to be about stimulating the imagination. Having said that, they probably could have done better with the final couple of scenes and individualised them a bit more to represent one of the three choices that we made. But anyway, I liken the endings to 2001 A Space Odyssey, not in content or context, but in the way that the individual viewer (gamer) makes of it what he will. I.E. the ending is only limited by the scope of our own imagination. Still peeved off about the day 1 dlc though, and all the weapons and armour DLC cut out of the game for use in other promotions. Also there seems to be a couple of achievements I cant get because they require online play. Oh and the MP component was pretty pointless, since i'll never play it again. Wished they had spent more time on SP content instead.",8,2012-03-28,XBOX 360,user

hitman47,"Mass Effect 3 is a great game that keeps pace with the high quality of the rest of the series. Gameplay wise we all know the drill, and if you played the other games in the series you should be very familiar with it. The narrative is tense and you know the galaxy is at stake this time. I loved both the characters, with all their releations, and the tense plot. Allthough being a sequel they could have fixed minor gameplay flaws from earlier games, like the semi-broken cover system that sometimes can be anoying and imprecise. The roleplaying elements could also have been more prominent, which I think the first one in the series did best. But all in all an amazing gaming experience. I strongly recommend playing on hardcore difficulty, because the enemy A.I. is smarter and more challenging which is a great thing. ME3 has some of the best enemy AI I have seen in a long time.",9,2012-03-28,XBOX 360,user
ASHIRAH,"ME 1 was smashing. Story, characters, everything. ME 2 was poor. Story, characters, everything. ME 3 is disappointing. Hey guys, isn't it time to stop building dumb arenas? It's the ADULT gaming era, ain't it? Conclusion, ME is a license that won't stay in my mind as one of the best ever (which ME 1 made me look forward to).",5,2012-03-27,XBOX 360,user
Hevilath,"Sound design: Musical score is excellent. In previous games music resembles space-opera in ME3 music has different tone, more depressing which perfectly matches Sheppard current mission - save sapient life in Milky Way galaxy from Reapers. Voice acting is superb and guns sounds heavy as it should be. Great achievement. Graphical presentation: I'm little disappointed. After replaying ME2 and switching directly to ME3 you can see low resolution textures on character models, maybe it is subjective but still is hard to distinguish different items on casual outfits. Some armor models looks better then others. Lightening and reflection on armor are far worse then in previous title. Backgrounds on early stages of game looks like it made in first Xbox times, but it seems as story progresses you loose track and graphic start to look better. Like I said - completely subjective feeling.. In the begging of game on Earth, when you look down you can see strange 2D people running from the building which reminds me first games on PS1 and there are some glitches - Sheppard have some problem with eyes in early stages of game ;) Gameplay: Action oriented, fast and rewarding. Your squad mates are usually helpful, but sometimes when you order them to shoot at Banshee they charge right in front of her dying in result. On harder difficulty levels this can be irritating. N7 Cerberus missions are taking place on Multiplayer maps and are quite boring - same with multiple fetch quests. I miss hiding gun animation and roaming freely. Story: First act of game is quite boring, but as you play you get more and more immersed into universe. Characters from ME2 and quests feel a little forced and doesn't have depth - example: Zaed or Kasumi, but this is minor accusation Ending: It's true. Rage is acceptable. Full of plot holes and doesn't explain anything. If you take it directly the ending could be explained as: Reapers has won - either they destroy everything, or you inflict so massive damage to galaxy that you wiped out all species and solar systems with reapers. The only explanation is Indoctrination Theory. We all could be indoctrinated by Bioware - if it's true, and we will now in April then it's most incredible achievement in gaming history - but still making DLC for incomplete game is horrible act - even when it will be released free of charge. To sum up: AWSOME!",7,2012-03-27,XBOX 360,user
rykeith,"After I finished the first Mass Effect in 2007, I couldn't wait to play the two scheduled sequels. I was a little disappointed in Mass Effect 2, as there were less RPG elements in the game. It felt more commercialized. Mass Effect 3 feels even more commercialized than the second game. The addition of multiplayer was not something I was looking forward to at all, and it was just as terrible as I imagined. Having to suffer through disconnections, annoying people online (think any popular FPS online chatter- that kind of annoying), and the exact same gameplay over and over (the only game mode is where waves of enemies spawn, you kill them, repeat) validated my concerns about the multiplayer. I firmly believe it was put in there solely to appease a wider audience and thereby increase game sales ($$$). The single player game was amazing up until the last 10 minutes. The ending was one of the worst I have ever experienced in my 23 years of playing video games. Also, if they are planning to release a different ending via DLC, that only further proves the point that it seems to be more about the money than it does the game, Mass Effect canon, gameplay, or the fans. In summary, much of the game is amazing, but I am overall very disappointed. Wish I would have stopped playing after the original Mass Effect.",6,2012-03-27,XBOX 360,user
lets_play,"I purposely stayed from reading any reviews, listening to any gaming podcasts, going on any gaming websites, basically tuned myself completely out from all media involved in gaming form the first day ME3 came out on March 6th, until the day I finished on march 13th. My initial feeling of the game I just played and finished, was simply WOW! And there were plenty of those moments throughout as well. This is on a short list of games that put me on such a ride, emotionally. There is so much heart in this game, the character development is off the charts. The story was grim and the desperation was evident. As the story went on I really began to get a sense of how this would end up. Little did I know that, the result of my initial playthrough would result in one of the worst, of the possible endings, and I still accepted it, and liked it. Shepherd and these other noble heroes sacrificing themselves for the future, is nothing short of spot on. Almost immediately after finishing the game, I went to Metacritic because I wanted to see other people's reactions to the game, and what the ""pros"" in the industry had to say as well. Then I saw it and I was beside myself!!!! Terrible user scores and as I dug deeper into the why, I was appalled! I thought maybe, I had searched the wrong game as all I saw was a cry baby effect! Look the ending may have left something to be desired, but I will ALWAYS side with the right of the creative forces behind the art, to do what they want with THEIR art, and not with those that stomp their feet and hold their breath like loud obnoxious spoiled children. IMO, this is the epitome of all that is wrong with our society and unfortunately is becoming more and more prevalent in it. This sense of entitlement, and utter outrage when things don't go as we see that they should. Everyone has the right to make their voices heard, and they should, but there is a proper way to do it. And I really thought this community of gamers, was above the idiotic 99% mentality, when it comes to making our voices heard. Everyone of those that, IMO, went too **** go out and make your own game. You can make it ANY way YOU want! Just like those at Bioware can make their game anyway THEY want. Have we all really forgotten to put ourselves in other peoples shoes, for even a second and rationalize things, in the hopes of making sense of something we don't agree with? Or are we barreling down a moral slope where we just stomp our fists in anger and he who yells the loudest wins? Also, really!?!?! Zero scores form users??? Wow, I mean c'mon, even if the assertion that the ending was horrible, the other 30+ hours were amazing, or at least somewhere in the middle. Lastly, I just have to say that I've seen all the arguments why the ending was ""horrible"" and have to say I can only give credence to one and that is that it was too ambiguous. There wasn't the necessary closure and I'll get to that in a second. Thinking back on things that happened in the first two games, things the story told us, the ending makes PERFECT sense, and is one of the most well put together stories ever (in any medium). They were telling us all along how it was going to play out and it did. The clues were there all along, we just had to pay attention to them and be able to bring the memories of them back when we needed them, maybe that's why it was so confusing because it didn't (outright) spell everything out for us, but kept the heart of the game in tact right up to the final decision, in that it was always about making the best decision based on the knowledge we had about the situation and living with the consequences, or just making the decision based on what we just ""wanted to do"", point is it was up to the player, the information was put in front of us and it was up to us to decide 1) how to play the game, 2) how much to prepare for the final battle and 3) the final decision (along with the romances, relationship stuff as well.) But to all those that said it made no sense, it did (at least to me) and I'm good with that! I really feel sorry for you all that it upset you so much but that's life (it is) and should be dealt with accordingly. I know this series (which I hold as one of the greatest ever) took a LOT of all of us, time wise, emotionally, **** at the end of the day it's still just a game and Bioware doesn't OWE us anything. They, like us, can CHOOSE, to make the game how they feel it best, and we can choose to support their future projects how we feel is most appropriate. But yeah, I would have liked to see more of what happened to all those characters I came to love so much, but that's not 100% necessary either. We'll either find out (one way or the other) or I have a very good imagination and am able to think it through logically enough that I'd bet I'd be pretty close to being right!

The story is perfectly made, however, BioWare was unable to put all the pieces back together in the ending, which is slightly disappointing. But people are being way too harsh with the game, a bad ending doesn't make a good game the worst game ever. People are overreacting. And while it is obvious that EA took out the Prothean and made it DLC to make money, I actually found myself preferring Javik over all the in-game characters, a bit overpriced.",10,2012-03-26,XBOX 360,user

Maybe I should hold off on judgment until after the coming changes are made, when I would likely be able to give this thing a 10/10, because that's what the rest of the game deserves. It seems crazy to me that this thing is getting such a wide range of ratings, considering the ending was really only the weak link here. And even with that I can't see anyone in their right mind giving this thing any worse than a 6/10.

Grimloche,"This game was amazing and don't let anyone talk you out of playing it because they hate EA. Honestly it's amazingly good. The entire game is filled with endings to all the major plot points maintained throughout the story. Big emotional events with sacrifice being a key theme happen regularly. There is literally an ending for every plot point in the series. So the complaint of the actual ending being bad, is based on people not realizing that fact. Those same people complaining about the lack of ending are the type of people who rush through the game and skip dialogue. You know who I'm talking about, we all know them.

YipManSays,I thoroughly enjoyed Mass Effect 3. The mechanics have been improved again and combat is still the fast paced and fluid combat it was in the second entry in the franchise. The story obviously takes a more serious tone because the galaxy is being annihilated by the Reapers in this entry. But the journey is fantastic and it is cool to see how decisions you made from back in the first or second game come back to change outcomes in the third. Multiplayer is also a nice addition and again Bioware integrates it with the single player outcome so that you are motivated to participate in it. As far as the ending goes it does leave a little more to be desired but I commend Bioware for trying something different. For me personally the ending wasn't a big deal because I enjoyed the journey along the way and characters I met. Overall a great title and worth your time!,9,2012-03-26,XBOX 360,user

phoenix83,"I don't understand all the negative reviews on this site, mostly based around the day one DLC. If you don't want it, don't buy it. The industry is using day 1 DLC as an extra way of making some revenue, and if that is what has to be done to stop price increases on games, then fine. I did download the DLC as I am such a big ME fan that I will bite the hand off the developers like a hungry lion for anything ME related. Admittedly the mission that comes with the pack is short, but the cutscenes included with it are amazing and give some real insight into the last days of the protheans in their war against the reapers. Plus Jarik seems to be a really interesting character with a kickass particle rifle which shepard can also use. My only advice with this weapon is not to let it run out of energy (make sure you take your finger off the trigger before that so it recharges). I am something like 7 hours into the single player and have put 2-3 hours into the multiplayer which I have also found to be great fun. Unfortunately due to losing my saves a while ago I am not in a position to play through all 3 games with the same character yet so I have had to import my ME2 soldier for my first ME3 playthrough but that's ok as all it means is I get to spend more time playing one of my favourite game series of all time! Not a loss in my book. This review is based on where I am in the game right now so I can't comment on the endings yet. I am interested to see if is bad as everyone is making out though.

As the final secrets are revealed, the player is confronted by the horrible truth that THE STORY MAKES NO SENSE. Clearly, the lead writer was out of his philisophical and intellectual depth.

sias,"A decent yet highly flawed finale to a great trilogy, that feels really quite dated. GOOD: Fantastic presentation and production values gives the game a fantastically epic feel at times (Palaven level in particular); Fun and varied combat that improves upon both ME1 and 2 by presenting the player with a greater diversity of enemies that require radically different techniques to beat; Generally stunning graphics and crisp, clean textures; Most character interactions are superb with a mostly decent script; Around 90% of the story is brilliantly told and exciting to participate in; Voice acting is top-notch and fleshes out the characters well; Much improved powers progression over ME2 with a slight decrease in overall linearity; Weapon mods are a welcome return as are the armour upgrades from ME2; Seeing the conclusions of many of your choices in previous games play out is generally pretty well done; Multiplayer is very good and offers a wealth of customisation and character progression; Space Hamster, Auto-Fish feeder and Blasto! BAD: Journal is terribly designed and does not update when new items for a quest are found, so quest progression can be confusing; When opening quest log it does not default to top of screen so you have to scroll through all the quests you've completed whenever you open it which is irritating and totally unnecessary; Graphical pop-in during many different parts of the game creates an unfinished look in an other wise highly polished game; Characters vanish during cutscenes and necks twist in weird laughably bad directions to compensate for bad character placement during some cutscenes; Human faces look awful at times compared to other Alien races and detract somewhat from the emotion of many cutscenes; During cutscenes graphical bugs occur wherein pistols are holstered on back or are invisible where Bioware always expected players to apparently be using an assault rifle; Shepard has an awful script which is positively cringe worthy in most instances and again detracts from the quality of cutscenes; Story has many exhaustingly contrived instances, such as the sudden emergence of a weapon that can destroy all the Reapers highlighting some terrible writing in parts; The Ending is horridly put together and highlights Bioware's inability to conclude compelling stories (Space Jesus? Why? Deus Ex Machina anyone?); Many quest bugs which require reloading from previous saves to proceed; The one-button-for-every-action is at it's worse now that Bioware have introduced rolling to the combat - having the same button for running, going into cover, interacting with an item, rolling and reviving team mates reeks of bad game design and causes far too many frustrating moments (See Vanquish for how to do this correctly); In multiplayer there are many gameplay bugs such as falling through floor, enemies becoming invisible/invincible, not being able to forward roll and use heavy attack for minutes at a time and being stuck on the spot forcing you to quit out of the game; The galaxy map is now at its most redundant with sections cut off until you reach ""that part of the game"" meaning actual exploration in Mass Effect 3 is incredibly linear; Scanning for War assets is dull and requires almost no input from the player; Side-quests are incredibly shallow and mostly require you to scan a planet to find some lost religious texts for a species and then find the numbered NPC on a map of the citadel to complete it (bearing in mind the journal never updates, so you only know if a mission is complete if a new numbered NPC appears on the map); Other side-quest follow a sloppy pattern of coincidently bumping into old team mates from ME2 under increasingly dull and contrived circumstances; Zero customisation of your teammate armour; Weapon mods are uninteresting and are mostly just scopes and bigger clips; Character progression is still immensely shallow, especially for your teammates; All aspects of character progression are combat based and there are no class specific skills to give you an advantage in any moments out of combat so your class has zero identity outside a combat situation; No mini-games for hacking doors now, just stand and watch Shepard wave his omni-tool around for a good 20 seconds (****); Reaper awareness meter on galaxy map is badly implemented and just becomes a nuisance instead of creating a feeling of actual panic; War Assest acquisition is wholly artifical and is quite simply a bar to raise so you get more of a choice of the same badly written and horribly presented ending. Overall Mass Effect 3 is a fun game to play, but it's shallow, buggy, has some terrible scripting blunders and horrid design choices that really tarnish what could have been a superb game and a definite contender for my GOTY.",8,2012-03-25,XBOX 360,user
YetiConfetti,"1. Bioware tried to listen to its fans, and it shows in the drastic differences between each game. Cut them some slack, it's impossible to account for everybody's personal preferences. 2. Bioware, I really hope you learn something from this catastrophe. I loved this game from start to finish, but I also agree with many of the complaints. Day 1 DLC, rushed and/or overly convoluted ending, and worst of all - forced multiplayer. I want to hate this **** after putting 90-some hours into it I can't bring myself to say it was bad. 3. I recommend this game to those who are patient and open-minded. It's a dialogue-heavy shooter, which is already something of an oxymoron, but ultimately either the story or the gameplay will hook you. It's just a shame that at this point in the series it's easy to see which element is obviously receiving more attention from the developers.",10,2012-03-25,XBOX 360,user

Would you petition an author to rewrite a book just because it didn't have an ending you liked? No. Mass Effect 3 has superseded all of my expectations and hopes I have grown since the first day Mass Effect 1 came out. The story is impressively extensive, and the combat has somehow improved upon the second. Many critisize the ending, and many give the game a ""0"" just because BioWare released downloadable content day one that was on the disc. What do I say? Don't buy the content, haha! It is embarrasing to have such whiners in the community, I truly believe they are all great people, smart, and are intelligent, but I believe people are losing themselves over a franchise they were so obsessed with, that because the ending left some questions unanswered, that because the ending was so out of their reach, they want to have one cohessive thought, and that (for some reason) is to complain. The game itself is not broken like some idiots try to reason, which is beyond me. The story is a masterpiece among modern games, a pinnacle of unventured futures of scifi epics, one that can rival that of Star Wars and Star Trek.

roflz1337,"While I did enjoy most of Mass Effect 3, there are several issues that I found quite disappointing and has left a severely bad after taste in my mouth. First of all, the move from even further away from its RPG roots. For example, the dumbing down of dialogue. The middle ground options seem to have just been completely removed, only providing you a top or bottom choice most of the time. Next, is the lack of exploration. The only place to go to talk to people, a RPG ""city"" as you will, is the Citadel. Other than that, its pretty much run and gun. The other issue I had with it is the day 1 DLC. It is obvious this character was never meant to leave the game. He provides key story information about the previous cycle, why the markers exist, the reapers, and the fate of the Protheans. My by far most unforgiving issue and biggest disappointment with the game are the endings. The last 10 minutes of the game introduce a brand new character, creates massive plot holes, provide zero closure to anything you've done, have no way to challenge the new end game character's ridiculously insane logic, and have each ending 98% the same as the others. In addition, no matter what choice you make throughout the entire saga, it will have no effect on the end sequence. You will not get any cut-scenes or any form of text explaining how your choices effected the galaxy or what happens to any of your squad mates. Every Shepard will receive the exact same set of endings regardless of what you do. The only factor that plays any roll on the ending is the ""effective military strength"". Overall, I found the endings to be so empty, depressingly unsatisfying, and poorly written that they have ruined the entire series. Being a long time Mass Effect fan since the first, I wanted to play from the beginning again, but after seeing and knowing what awaits me at the end of 3, I can't even look at it. As I said in the beginning, I did still enjoy most of Mass Effect 3 and could look past its step back from its RPG roots still. Excluding the endings, rating it based soley off the journey up to the end point, i would give the game a 9/10. However, the endings are simply story telling suicide that are so bad they tarnish the entire series greatness. Due to that factor, I give the game overall a 2/10 for the amount of damage the endings do to the franchise along with the depressingly bad after taste it leaves.",2,2012-03-25,XBOX 360,user

TheOutlawXanadu,"First thing's first: Mass Effect 3's ending is truly awful. I won't go into detail as to why because a simple Google search will yield about a million articles on the subject; just know it's pretty bad. Unfortunately, some people have gone so far as to claim the ending makes the game worthless, and I disagree with that. For the most part, the game is amazing. It has by far and away the most personal moments of the series and ties up some sub-plots wonderfully (Mordin's comes to mind). The combat is also really fun, although sometimes the level design is a little clunky. Really, the only criticism I have of the game besides the ending is the overwhelming amount of automatic dialog. It should also be noted that because of this, playing as a true Renegade might be impossible. Overall, Mass Effect 3 is a terrific game with one gargantuan flaw. I admit the ending is so bad I once considered never playing the series again, but after bringing myself back down to Earth a little, I have realized that reaction was ridiculous. It's still the same great trilogy it always was; you just gotta forget about the last 10 minutes.",8,2012-03-25,XBOX 360,user

Just pathetic, how could you call yourselves fans? Why are you mad at Bioware? Is it because of the ending? First of all the ending is the work of the writer, the final 10 minutes is where the poor writing starts, and I admit the ending was a letdown, but I still love BioWare and I still love ME3, so if you should criticize anyone then attack the writer regarding the final 10 minutes. Bioware has forged this magnificent story and lore for us all to enjoy and yet many of you attack them for minor details, I am ashamed to even think they are a part of the fanbase. Many loyal fans and I included still appreciate ME3 and all the story + lore shared by BioWare and I am not going to let some silly ending bring me down, give the scores the game deserves.",10,2012-03-25,XBOX 360,user

Neoimperialist,"Right this minute, Bioware is holding the future of narrative video gaming by the tail. They have been holding it for five years, but the future is a rough beast and Bioware must seize it soon or it will break their grip and scamper away for someone else to catch. Bioware didn't just create a series of games in Mass Effect, they created a phenomenon in video gaming. Perhaps without understanding it fully, they created the concept **** that could be entirely dependent on the actions of the player. When taken to a futuristic conclusion, it implies a game series in which not merely the narrative conclusions are dependent on player actions, but one in which the story itself that the player experiences depends on them. A game that offers multiple stories and experiences rather than one that simply tweaks conclusions. A narrative template comprising a whole universe that could be enriched over and over with new content. It is a breathtaking idea if only Bioware has the vision to see it. Mass Effect is a prototype, an imperfect exemplar of what such a game series could be. It was a good enough illustration of the concept that it was immediately embraced by gamers all over the world, but it is nothing like a complete realization. The technology will certainly require improvement before complete realization can be achieved. The problem here, is not so much that the end was that bad. I believe that it was a horrible narrative choice, but ultimately that comes down to a matter of taste. The problem here is that at the eleventh hour, Bioware lost sight of the brilliance of their own concept and fell back on the past and on a final gimmick that turned the game's agile feet into clay. The prototype game of the future was hobbled by antiquated marketing notions. They wanted that last game to be all things to all people without taking into account just why the concept was revolutionary by itself. At the same time, though, they wanted it to be completely unique. Unforgettable was the word that Casey used. It was this awkward combination of marketing goals that was the downfall of the game. The multiple play modes.were, in fact, a stroke of genius. Had the mission structure lived up to the concept of the series ME3 would have been astonishing rather than merely very good. Had the game ended with multiple reflections of previous actions, the game would have been a nearly perfect experience instead of a trauma for so many. They didn't need the gimmick at the end to make the game unique, because they already had uniqueness built into the concept. Someone forgot that the concept depends on the player creating his own uniqueness.. In fact, this is a game concept in which the player creates his own experience. This is what mystifies me about Bioware's protestations regarding their alleged sole proprietary interest in the creative process. In creating this gaming concept, they gave up a bit of narrative creative interest to the gamer himself, so now I see little sense in miming surprise over this current controversy. In over 25 years of video gaming I have never seen anything to match the depth of emotional investment this game series has elicited from its fan base. I very much wonder whether the suits at EA have any genuine appreciation at all of the magnitude of Bioware's accomplishment in that regard. With all that, Bioware is still on the razor's edge of inventing a whole new future for narrative video gaming if Bioware will commit themselves to seizing it. I have opined elsewhere that the franchise may be ruined already. That may or may not be the case, but the concept is alive and well if only Bioware will embrace it fully.",5,2012-03-24,XBOX 360,user

Is it really that bad to have an end that feels like something is happening for the greater good? No. That's what makes an awesome ending. I've been a fan of this series since it first came out and I still love it. I love each character and the intricate details within Mass Effect 3.

megadude510,"Not only did Bioware decide to appeal to the greater masses by giving up the individuality and writing of the previous two games in the Mass Effect installment, but they have given up their talent. Mass Effect 3 reduces game choices to simple 2-decision dialogue bubbles, forces a multiplayer element into the game in order to get the ""good"" ending, and blatantly plagiarizes artwork from both a stock image site and Deviant Art. Notably, the former was used, (albeit poorly photoshopped), as the reveal of the identity of a character that had been left faceless for the entire series. The voice talent of many of the prominent figures from previous games are also notably absent, leaving one to wonder if Bioware had decided to cut corners, or if they just gave up. Enemy variety is reduced to a fraction of what it was before, weapons are scarce as ever to come by, and one strange element is how ammunition is once again in the form of bullets, when in previous games you had an unlimited amount. This is the future after all, isn't it? Day-one Downloadable Content is also present, which is senseless and blatant greed on the developer's part. This wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that there was also DLC in the previous two installments, and a large portion of Mass Effect 3's character development is obtainable by playing those. The game is forced, as well as your decisions in it, unless you decide to fork the dough over to Bioware for the final installment in the series. If you're unhappy with the endings, which are all the same save for a different color of firework, don't worry! Bioware's publicly apologized and is working on a new ending.

TheQuietGamer,"When I first started playing this game I hated it, it felt to me like Bioware had sold out in order to make more people com to the series so they could make the most money, I thought this because Shepard did most of the talking and you only had one or two chances to choose a response, but that was just the opening moments and after the first hour or two you begin to realize that this is still your story, your choices matter, and this is one of the greatest games of all time, it's true Shepard will do a lot of the talking, but you'll still get to make the big decisions in the conversation that define you as the main character, they just get the small talk out of the way so you can make the real decisions, and while I don't want to see that happening anymore in future Bioware games it just works for some reason here, and speaking of decisions you have some extremely tough ones to make, every choice you make truly effects the galaxy, and it kept me more emotionally invested in it than any other game ever has, and every choice you made in the first two Mass Effect games including the DLC come back here to either help or haunt you, and that truly makes the fact that this is your story all the more believable, and the relationships you've made through the first two games affect this one in such an emotional and powerful ways I can't help but love this, you'll find yourself falling in love with the characters all over again, and you'll also love the new characters just as much, another thing that puts this game above every other is the fact that this game captures the feeling of all out galactic warfare like no other game has, the battles are intense and truly give you the feeling of fighting in a war, and every decision you make carries wait and affects the war like no other game has, the combat is tight but not the tightest, basically it's no Gears of War in the combat, I'd even say that combat was smoother in Mass Effect 2, but it's far better then the first Mass Effect, and it is still addicting and fun to kill enemies, and the ending, while most people are complaining about it, I personally liked mine, granted I would have rather walked of happily with Tali off into the sunset and lived happily ever after with my friends, but it's still emotional and leaves a lot open for other games in this series, and hopefully more DLC and sequels (bring Shepard back please!), and the ending and the scene after the credits just brought a lot of question I need answered, it also has some fantastic multiplayer (similar to Gears of War's horde mode) that ties in well to the campaign, it does have some issues like one or two plot holes, glitches, it's not going top please newcomers all that much, and one or two other issues, but after playing this emotional masterpiece I can't help but give it a 10 out of 10, and when I think about this game and how it does things that no other game has ever done and I doubt ever will the issues mean nothing, this is truly a masterpiece and I'm just going to come out and say it the greatest game I've ever played, oh yeah and this is also the best looking game I've ever seen, it has some of the craziest moments and awesome set pieces that put the Call of Duty series to shame, and the voice acing is phenomenal, a true masterpiece and one of, if not the greatest game/games of all time, and a must play for fans.",10,2012-03-23,XBOX 360,user
TheSilhouette,"And the series ends with an incoherent whimper: BioWare's MASS EFFECT 3 is a colossal let down. The final installment in the trilogy, it is a game plagued by small glitches, a broken journal system (where you're never quite sure where you need to go to fulfill your quest), auto-dialogue (as opposed to the branching dialogue choices of the first two games) and one hell of a laughable ending that sinks the whole mess. People act like the ending is some kind of ""artistic statement"", but the ""Final Hours"" app shows the game's lead writer and project director were unsure of how to end their game as late as November 2011 (when the game was supposed to come out). As a result, they stole the storyline from Matrix 2 & 3 and jammed it into the ending of ME3. Suddenly our choices don't matter, and the ending cinematics are both lazy and baffling.

As a 40+ year-old married dad, I almost felt guilty with my obsession with this. I played each game multiple times with many of the possible paths that were available. Amazing. As far as the ending. Honestly there was much to be desired. In retrospect, absolute closure would have been worse. Because of the current ending possibilities, the Mass Effect universe is still vital. There is much to talk about, much to think about. No matter how many negative scores or reviews that are given on this site, there is this simple truth. This game got under the skin of thousands of people. Not just time and money invested could explain the reaction to the endings. People became Shepard and really connected with the characters and the story. This alone is reason enough for me to give this game a perfect 10.

Also it didn't matter if you cheated on your li or not as bioware has said which was disappointing as well. And the ending...

BusyBusyPanda,"We all know the ending was bad but my complaint is about the actual game bugs and there were bugs in this game. The very foremost is that the Shepard importer does not recognize Mass Effect 1 created Shepards so if you have a character that you have used since the first game the third game does not recognize it and you have to start a new face from scratch. I consider this a DOA critical error. How did this get past QA!? From the very start before the game even begins you have a broken line of code. That is unforgivable. During game play I encountered other problems such as party members getting frozen in ladders leaving you to fight the rest of the mission alone, invisible faces on Shepard, Garrus dissapeared more than once while talking to him, if you chose a specific plot arc and a character dies that character if they are your love interest the game pulls them back from the dead to have sex with you on the Normandy and then ending has more than one inescapable plot holes. I mean dead characters reappearing as if ressurected from the grave plot holes so big you could drive a Mako through them. This game felt over all rushed and I cannot recommend it to anyone unless you are someone who enjoys a bad game like some people like bad horror films. And yes I found the ending to be fundamentally in contrast to the advertising of this game. Choices ment nothing what so ever in the long run and that is just sad.",1,2012-03-22,XBOX 360,user
a335w,"For me, plot is everything that makes a game. You can shoot aliens or people in just about any game. Once you've played one FPS or RPG and you learn the mechanics, they only very slightly from game to game. The biggest differentiation between games is the plot, the characters, and their story. These things are responsible for drawing the gamer in and making them care. For the plot to go so terribly wrong in the final minutes is mind blowing. Through this trilogy the plot was masterfully crafted, like a fine wine. I never noticed a single plot-hole until the last five to ten minutes of this game. The ending robed this series of everything I was led to believe it stood for, violates canon, presents flawed logic, and introduces inexplicable situations and plot-holes. It is hard for me to understand how the plot could be so finely crafted for one hundred plus hours, only to be spoiled in the final five to ten minutes of the final game of this trilogy. Furthermore, it's as if they cut the story off at its climax. There are no signs of denouement to be found for the main plot. As such, this game fails to deliver on the developer's promise that this game would wrap up the main plot and answer many remaining questions. I sincerely hope that this was not an intentional ploy to sell DLC. I hope that Bioware comes through on releasing a better ending, however, if they intend to sell it to me, I'm done. I would much rather they sell a complete game to me at $70, than to sell me an incomplete game for $60 and charge me $10 to properly complete the game. How underhanded and dishonest is that? I'd also rather they release the game months past its due date than release an incomplete game, but that is more tolerable. With plot being my sole purpose for buying and playing games, I cannot honestly rate my experience any higher.

MalFet1999,"As I write this review I am watching the credits roll after finishing my first play-through of Mass Effect 3. I am a huge fan of the series, having logged hundreds of hours in the first two installments. In those games I followed every story arc to it's end, had every conversation I could. I became invested, and I loved the universe of the Mass Effect series because my actions created the experiences I had there. For these reasons I am disappointed in this latest installment. Disappointed because the decisions of the first two installments take minor roles, and new game play options take center stage. This is a game that should have been made for the fans, not to garner support for Kinect and lay claim to a new multiplayer audience. This (supposedly) final installment feels like a slap in the face to the fans of the series. There is no soul, no investment in the story line. Each ""priority"" mission feels like a chore instead of a journey, and the story as a whole is simply swiss cheese; full of holes. Take the opening sequence, for example. (This is not a spoiler. It was in the demo. Just a heads up.) Reapers descend on Earth, and Commander Shepard just strolls over to the only Mass Relay in the solar system and simply flies off into the sunset? Are the followers of the immaculate story telling from the first two installments meant to believe that the Reapers wouldn't even post a guard at the Relay? Nothing? Even knowing that Commander Shepard, the constant thorn in their paw, would be trapped if they block his only escape route? I think not. The bottom line is this: the combat is engaging, dynamic and very fun, but the story is utter trash. My disappointment is so strong that I can't even allow my love of the first two games to influence this negative opinion at all. Multiplayer is a decent addition, and Kinect audio functions are novel, but as a whole this game is forgettable. I never thought I'd describe Mass Effect this way. I'm sure that other (former) fans feel the same way.",4,2012-03-22,XBOX 360,user

This game was overall a disappoint to me, and I won't trust BioWare as I used to until I read a numerous amount of user reviews. No BS critic reviews that paid off critics write. Buyer beware.

Kaisar_Villhelm,"I have to say that this is probably my favorite game in the series, as it causes the playing character to actually reflect on what his/her choices actually amount to after all three segments of the epic are finished. I understand that many people are very disappointed with the ending presented, and without spoiling anything, I want to state that I understand many of the complaints about the ending--personally I like a game to break its boundaries and have a tangible effect on how I feel as a gamer. The game play in this segment of the series is excellent, a true amalgam of the first and second games. The multiplayer aspect of the game also keeps the game fresh after the two (or more) mandatory playthroughs to see the effects of the paragon/renegade choices. With that said, however, I will say that I was disappointed with how many graphical glitches I encountered through my playthroughs. I saw many occurrences of invisible or skewed models in cutscenes and during gameplay. All in all, though, the game was a fantastic emotional experience, the ending included. Minus a few graphical issues here and there, I would honestly say that this game is worthy addition to the fantastic Mass Effect series.",9,2012-03-21,XBOX 360,user

korndawggg,"I am not going to waste my time explaining why this was another great game in a fantastic series. I simply want to post my rating so Bioware knows not every internet user hates their guts. It is absurd the reaction this game has gotten, as it was nothing short of a masterpiece of gaming. I have enjoyed every second of the 30+ hours of gameplay (up to and including the ending) and I understand a few of the complaints, but a few (possible) plot holes and a little convoluted conclusion does nothing to diminish the fun I had while playing through this great game. I am disappointed that, ultimately your decisions in the prior three games do not affect the ending much, but the story I experienced up until the ending would have been extremely different had someone else been making decisions through the games. I commend Bioware for yet another amazing game and cannot wait for their next one.",10,2012-03-21,XBOX 360,user

Let's talk about that ending, spoiler free: It wasn't the cliched ""happily every after"" ending. Get over it. Nor was it the macabre ""everybody dies"" ending that some people were expecting. It was a nested medium of the two, while having conflict resolution. It might help if some of the casual gamers who bought this game just because of the advertising and high school chatter would actually go back and play the first two. Find some middle-ground.

Comrade_Critic,"This is a great game. Visually it is a masterpiece. Content wise I too was disappointed with how short the game is and that includes release date DLC--which is a complete and utter rip off move. ME2 was by far the most fun of the series, but ME3 still delivers. And despite what the whiners say, the ending was a satisfactory conclusion to a great trilogy. My only real complaint is that the game is too short. ME2 felt much more open for exploration, whereas ME3 is much more limited and closed off. I also wish there was more continuity between ME2 and ME3. All those characters I devoted so much time into building relationships with were mostly chucked within the first 10 hours of ME3. Ultimately though, I wish more games were like Mass Effect 3. Except for the release day DLC. That's a total dbag move.",8,2012-03-21,XBOX 360,user

rappstar,"In a vacuum, this game doesn't ****. Objectively, it was the weakest of the 3 and that is why it deserves the low rating. Therefore in context, this was just not a good game. Likely you already know the ending was so bad that it overshadowed so much of the rest of it. In an RPG, the story is kind of important to the overall enjoyment of the game. Part of the problem is that the story was so weighed down from the previous 2 games that it collapsed under the weight. Nothing was new. It was boring and predictable in quite a few places. Somehow planet scanning even got worse! Also, there were major flaws that mechanically drug it down also. I don't recall a single mini-game. It was just walking around pressing ""A"" button. Without giving anything away, the mechanic in the downtime makes Sheperd an eavesdropping weirdo. He just walked around like a creepy guardian angel. The multiplayer is surprisingly fun and the combat is better in someways, but on the whole, its just not as good as its predecessors. That is what I think bothers so many people. I pre-ordered the CE from amazon. Currently, I am torn about sending it back and just forgetting the whole thing ever happened. Swing and a miss.",1,2012-03-21,XBOX 360,user

Robbie1982,"In my opinion the negative feedback from user's for this game is unfair. ME1 was excellent apart from the bugs, and I would rate it 9/10. ME2 Felt dumbed down and I missed the mako and the customisation despite loving the more active paragon/renegade elements. I have really enjoyed ME3. Had more than a few goosebumps moments and felt connected with the returning characters. James didnt seem to get fleshed out at all (dlc ?) Given the massive odds against shepherd I had no grip with the ending. My feedback on the game I played is it didnt seem obvious to me the multiplayer was tied to galactic readiness (sure I am not the only person who missed that ?) Still miss the customisation and stats !! and The last battle should have been more epic. Only take two members to finish saving the galaxy ? No way ! And why couldnt that final push have been the team meets up, and fights an epic battle to the transport beam ? I think that was a missed opportunity. The stores also need to realise when I have a level 4 upgrade and stop selling me junk. But I honestly feel this is a great game. And I love the multiplayer (although Expensive Bioware points for packs - is I have to say a total afront when I've paid the full 35 pounds for a PC game - Thats aimed at EA ) IMHO Awesome game. Given 10 because people are being harsh giving it 0. And if the fan vids about indoctrination turn out to be true, then that is an incredible twist and precedent. Regardless - great game.",10,2012-03-21,XBOX 360,user

wizark,"In one word: disappointing. Where to even start with this game? I went into it still riding high on the fond memories of Mass Effect 1 and 2, expecting the advertised ""spectacular conclusion to the series"", but what I got fell terribly short. Honestly, I had to give this game as much as a 6 purely for the stunning graphics, it looks amazing. The storytelling is pretty bad, characters go to severe waste, and the whole thing is incredibly dumbed down from the RPG that Mass Effect 1 was. First off: dialogue. Throughout most of the game, I felt like my dialogue options were limited to ""say X or say X while sounding a little more like jerk."" There was hardly a decision to be made here. Apart from the limited options, the dialogue its self was poor. I thought I was playing a game based on my character's choices, but more often than not , Shepard took off on his own little non-interactive cutscenes with other characters. I'm sure many of us remember being disappointed with the way we could interact with the DLC squad mates (Kasumi/Zaeed) on the Normandy. In ME3, that's pretty much the way it works with everyone. You don't enter into conversations with them, you don't get to investigate any of their stuff in their rooms even. Shepard just stands there and talks to them in pre-done conversations on his own. Lame. I guess Bioware seemed to think that Shepard had grown a mind of his/her own and didn't need any input from the player. Past decisions were factored in minimally I felt, plot holes all around, things just happen and there's no real feeling of meaning to them. I know there's a galaxy wide war for survival going on, but that doesn't mean everyone in the galaxy is just going to change and roll along with it for you. Come on Bioware, are you even trying anymore? Oh, and Tali's ""gift"", seriously?",6,2012-03-21,XBOX 360,user

dpark189,"just wtf were they thinking? where are shepherd's emotions for his dying ""friends,"" and why are previous decisions just glazed over and ignored? even putting those big issues aside, the ending was one of the most disappointing pieces of garbage I have ever witnessed. you go through 3 games, 5 years total playing this trilogy and you are given 3 choices? what was the point of all those other choices that were posed as ""big deals,"" when they don't even come into play at the end? never mind how screwed everyone is at the end, the ending choices themselves end up screwing everyone or taking away from their autonomy as sapient beings one way or another! How did a game series so good just down right destroy their reputation in one fell swoop? Then there are the plot holes. I won't spoil anything too badly here, but if you have played the game then you know that there are irreconcilable problems with many aspects of the ending. these writers need to go through some kind of common sense seminar or something because this is unacceptable. My recommendation to anyone who has not bought the game is to wait and see if there are any worthwhile dlc's that come out in the future, otherwise you will be angry as a guy who was just sold a turd in the guise ****.",2,2012-03-21,XBOX 360,user

JingoJango,"Great game, but slightly disappointing compared with ME2. The thing I loved about ME2 was the believable world the game took place in, the character development and the feeling that there were real consequences to your actions. ME3 has far less depth, with side quests simply being fetch quests initiated by overhearing NPC incidental conversations. I was also annoyed by how easy it was to skip passed prominent characters from ME2 without ever meeting them. (Got an email from Thane, but by the time I returned to Citadel it had already been invaded and I can only assume he died, because he never was in that hospital) The addition of multiplayer makes up for a lot of these sins, which although it is just horde mode with no pvp, I'm finding it highly addictive. I don't agree with calls to change the ending, it is what it is, but can't shake the slight feeling of disappointment it failed to live up to the promise of ME2. Still great game that I would recommend to anyone.",8,2012-03-21,XBOX 360,user
LadyDumrotten,"Mass Effect 3 is an epic masterpiece of storytelling in a video game that is crippled by anti-consumer policies and some sloppy corner-cutting in terms of playability. As someone who has been completely invested in this universe, I couldn't be more satisfied with the game's storyline and character development. It is an incredible work of popular fiction, on par with great TV series like LOST or Battlestar Galactica and there's absolutely nothing else like it in video games. It's unfortunate then, that anti-consumer policies bog down what is otherwise an exceptional experience. First of all, some of the game's best and most essential single-player content has been put into a 10 dollar day 1 dlc to curb used sales. On top of that, an online pass is required to access the game's micro-transaction based multiplayer... which you need to play in order to get the best endings in the single-player game. You see what I mean by anti-consumer? I feel like this is especially insiduous and unacceptable. The developers have claimed that you don't NEED to play the multiplayer to get the best ending, but I just don't see how it's possible. I wasted hours of my life playing all the horrible fetch quests and running from reapers on the galaxy map just so I could scan a stupid planet (seriously, whoever designed this side-content... ugh) and get a good rating, but by the end it still wasn't enough. To top it off, it is clear that very little time was spent on the game's UI. That said, I still love this game and think it is an absolute must play. Bioware is clearly still an extremely talented developer and the problems in this game are nowhere near as serious as they were in Dragon Age II. I just hope they learn from the negative feedback and stop nickel-and-diming us to death. I doubt it'll happen though.",8,2012-03-21,XBOX 360,user

Then imagine no matter what decisions you made, every storyline ended the same way with a last second twist that you didn't really even care about and contradicted all the decisions you had made previously. Would you recommend these books? Would you go back and reread the books and make different decisions knowing you were going to dislike the ending and your decisions didn't matter?

In addition, though Bioware specifically stated there would be ""wildly different endings"" and that the multiplayer would be completely non-obligatory, those statements are false.

PAB_013,"I have been a die hard ME fan from day one, having spent countless 100s of hours playing through nearly every class, every side mission, exploring all romances, seeing every world, and painstakingly making every choice in the anticipation of how it all would come together right now. Sadly, I share the feeling of disappointment expressed by many of my fellow gamers. ME has become a shell of what it once was. Instead of getting an in depth story with interesting characters and relationships that I care about and the feeling that every decision, both big and small, would play a part in the shape of this world, I got a straight forward action game with little depth and characters who I don't know or care about(e.g. James, Kai Leng). Every mission from beginning to end consists of your goal to gain war assets and at some point someone dies or nearly dies. Which was emotional at first, but once you realize it's happening every time it losses its affect. There is also a clear de-emphasis on everything besides the main action, you can't do a side missions until their location is unlocked through progressing in the story. Side missions consist of over hearing conversations and going to seek out what they were talking about by scanning a planet or finding it during the main quest. If the item is passed over during the main quest, though, it can be purchased cheaply later on. The other side missions have replaced the scanning/resource mini game from ME2. It is poorly executed on several phases. Before you can scan a particular planet you have to ping it, which isn't a problem unless there are reapers in the neighborhood. In which case, if you can't find it in the first few tries the reapers chase you out of the system and you have to wait before you can come back and try again. Once you ping the correct planet you have the option to scan the planet, the same as scanning planets in ME2. This is a waste of time since there is only one spot and it points you right to it and about 90% of the time it is on the opposite side of the planet. There are also no updates added to your codex or galaxy map as you attain your side mission or the items associated with them, so you will be flipping to your codex before you go to your galaxy map to find which system and planet you need to travel to, and when you find the item for the mission you'll need to either complete it immediately or have a way to remember you recovered it, otherwise there's nothing to say not to go back. The reward for completing the missions is gaining war assets which along with completing multiplayer missions affects your total readiness for the final Reaper assault. In actuality, doing these have little affect on the ending of the game, which as many have already stated is very poor. All other mini games/puzzles have been removed. There is also lack of subtlety/emphasis in your relationships with everyone around you. Very early on in the story you are either given the option or it is blatantly obvious that a particular person is going to be a romance option, and other than that, with a few exceptions (mostly Garrus and Tali), they have nothing particularly interesting to say. Multiplayer consists of a horde mode which can provide a diversion from the main story but doesn't add anything particular interesting. Biggest gripe is the randomness of unlocking new weapons/characters/perks instead of letting me use my credits to choose how I would prefer to play. The combat mechanics and graphics, aside from the ridiculous ""enhanced"" character models, are the best of the series, but the de-evolution of the series, the feeling of being mislead (e.g. choices affecting the game, being able to get the best ending without playing multiplayer), and the sense that a money grab played a huge part the final product (they even message they give after beating the game is more or less an urge to buy dlc) felt like a slap in the face.

MantonX2,"If you are here trying to decide if you want to buy this game, then do yourself a favor. Honestly, any review you see that gives this game a 10 and calls it perfection, ignore. That's not realistic. Likewise, any review that says it's utter garbage and a 0, ignore. It to is not driven by reality. The rating system is not complex enough here for me to give a visual score so I will put it here. Assume the game takes 30hours to beat. If I were to score the first 29hrs and 50mins this game would easily get an 7-8. If I curb my desire to have more RPG elements that were closer to the first ME then I could easily give it an 8-9. In a nutshell, the majority of players are going to love those first 29hrs and 50mins. It's a wild and at times emotional ride full of action and loss. The graphics aren't ground breaking, but they are more than enough to carry this game and convey the enormity of it all. The final battle is epic in scale and amazing even if I wanted to see so much more of it and all of those assets that I put into place during the game. That said, the final 10mins completely undoes everything that comes before it and that the franchise stands for. You go from being an active participant in the story of -your- Commander Shepard to a bystander. In those ten minutes, they undo almost every important fact that they disclosed and you realize that all of those huge and small decisions you made over 3 games and 5 years brings you to the exact same place as everyone else who played with only very small variations to the same exact ending. And in the process, they have ruined the entire franchise for me. For that, the ending gets a 0. Combined, I can't give ME3 more than a 4 even if it hurts my heart. Some are going to say that giving the ending a 0 is ridiculous, but let me ask you this. Ignoring the plot holes, inconsistencies, spurious and circular logic and the rest; does it seem right that I take my ""Everyone Lives/Super Paragon Blew Up The Collector Base"" ending ME2 Shepard into ME3 and my friend takes his ""Man I screwed up and almost every squad member died and I handed over the Collector Base"" joke ME2 Shepard and we both get the exact same ending without variation?

Ryoten,"First of all i want to say that this game is MOSTLY good. It's the ending that ruins it. I'll explain why the ending ruins the game without spoiling anything. Mass Effect series has been a game all about choice. The choices you pick will have negative or positive impacts. In the final scheme of things, these choices do not have any reflection on the end. Basically, the ending is always the same (minus your favorite color choice of explosions. No im not kidding, its exactly as it sounds). The ending of this game will make you feel like everything you did was for nothing. It brings no closure, and is riddled with plotholes. Playing a 60+ hour RPG should give you a satisfied ending, whether its happy or sad. This game undoes everything you did and makes it feel like it was all for nothing. I love mass effect, but these endings are non-sensical, and not poetic. Not only do the endings make you feel like you just wasted your time, but they also do not make any sense by going against the games logic, set forth in the previous games and in ME3 itself. It feels like a rush job and sloppy writing. I strongly advise you to not listen to what naysayers who speak of ""Mass Effect 3 being a work of art"" say. If you ask any of them why they like the game, they can't give you a straight answer other than them being Bioware fans. I love bioware, but when someone takes advantage of you as a consumer, you have to call them out on it. And anyone reading this, i am TRYING to protect you as a consumer and not as a troll. DO NOT waste your time with this game. If it wernt for the ending, i would say play it. But unless Bioware does something to make the endings feel more worth it. Just avoid this series.",1,2012-03-20,XBOX 360,user
Jaye9001,"One of the better games I have played this generation. If you liked the style and gameplay of Mass Effect 2 you will enjoy this game. The story is fantastic and the combat is better than average. It will not take the place of Gears of War, but compated to Mass Effect 1 it has come along ways.",10,2012-03-20,XBOX 360,user
Dustedshaft,Im surprised how many people are saying this is a bad game because really it is good the gameplay is improved over the second one although there are less dialogue options but overall it doesnt affect the game that much there is lots to do and most side quests are very unique and are worth doing. The last hour (excluding the last 5 minutes) are very entertaining and show the desperation. However the very end isnt necessarily bad but in my opinion and I think many others agree that it wasn't the ending I wanted and it wasn't the right ending and after you rage a little bit you just have to accept it. Overall I would recommend this game to almost everybody and if you haven't played the others and this is the one you start with the ending might not bother you as much and you play this game,9,2012-03-20,XBOX 360,user
TristonDaShorty,"After the first of this series, I was hooked. The Mass Effect franchise was the thing a cared about most in video games, and I was not disappointed with ME3. The game starts off quick and hooks you immediately and the story progresses as fast or a slow as you want it to depending on how many of the side quests you partake in. Some of the side quests did feel boring but the boring ones were quick, so the gripe is a small one. But the priority missions are where its at, there insanely fun and none of the missions disappointed me. There are three main enemies in this game, each diverse and different from one another (Cerberus, Geth, and of course the Reapers). The multi-player is fun and a great little edition, this is still very much a single player game though. And despite what most people are saying, in my opinion the decisions you made in ME2 and the original do impact your game. If you expected them to have a massive impact then I guess you'll be disappointed, but it does affect the way certain characters treat you, and which characters carry on into Mass Effect 3. Another complaint I keep hearing about is the ending, I could see where people would complain about the ending of ME3, but I thought it was a beautiful way to end the series. The ending would have been more well received if Mass Effect 3 was a movie, because its not your typical video game ending in any way shape or form. Aside from some short but boring side quests there is one more gripe, you will often times find yourself rolling instead of jumping in and out of cover, this for me was really annoying and is pretty much the reason why I'm giving the game a 9 instead of a 10. But overall, this was a fantastic way to end the series and I was not disappointed in the least, a must buy in my opinion.",9,2012-03-20,XBOX 360,user
dmjrnbsn,"One of the most profoundly disappointing endings to any story in any medium. The writers removed the cornerstone in which the entire story was built upon - choice and consequence. So, the entire building comes crashing down at the end. In the end, none of the choices your character makes throughout three games matter. All the relationships you've built are meaningless. There is no closure in the relationships made, whether between LIs or squad mates. They never come to fruition, and there is no resolution. ME3 was advertised to have a multitude of outcomes based upon players' choices. That's what originally made the Mass Effect franchise such a great success. The finale should have raised the player to great heights or taken the player to despair... and everywhere between based upon the consequences of the player's decisions throughout the entirety of the series(Paragon, Renegade, or somewhere in between). BioWare should have finished their remarkable work on the strengths that it was built on. Choice and consequence. It seemed like a given, but... You leave the game feeling complete and utter disappointment. It is truly remarkable how an ending can be so profoundly and remarkably bad. It truly destroys the franchise entirely. This is not an easy thing to say, as I've loved the series from the start. There is no replay value at all. BioWare has ruined years of work in the last ten minutes on what should have been one of the greatest RPGs of all time. It will be a study in the future on how not to end a story franchise.",0,2012-03-20,XBOX 360,user

Demorase,"Can the ending ruin the journey? Well Mass Effect 3 attempts to give a definitive answer to that question, and it is a resounding yes. The ending violates everything Mass Effect stands for (i.e choice) and needs to be changed, but for that to happen you need to get the message through to Bioware, and this is a way to contribute.

Xabong,"If you are at all invested in the Mass Effect universe, this game will make you cry. The emotional payoff in this game is absolutely huge and Bioware's accomplishment in this area is absolutely unprecedented. Even if it is mostly smoke and mirrors, you really feel at the end that this was YOUR journey and it's hard to imagine it playing it out any other way. I think it speaks to the strength of the series that I do not WANT to play through the series a second time making different choices because I feel like it would spoil what I've decided is canon. That said, Bioware botched one major aspect of the game - the UI. This seems minor, but some of the problems make playing the game feel like a chore. They wanted to add more rpg elements, but they did so in such a sloppy way that it makes you really wish they hadn't. Menus are clunky and not user-friendly at all. The game does not even have proper quest tracking which will mean a lot of aimless walking around not knowing where to go or who to talk to. WHY, Bioware? The first two games had great quest tracking. The minor sidequests are also so awkwardly handled that they should have been left out because they really detract from the experience. Also, expect dozens and dozens of instant game over screens trying to outrun ridiculously fast reaper ships on the galaxy map. Yeah, Bioware, REALLY fun. These faults really stand out in what is otherwise a masterpiece and that makes them all the more frustrating because they are things that have worked in previous games. *sigh*",8,2012-03-20,XBOX 360,user
RandomCriticDan,"With a powerful plot, advanced combat, and smarter enemies, this game really presents itself as it should be- a fantastic ending to a chilling, unrivalled series. The character development, which quite possibly the most important quality the series held for me, is even deeper than the previous games. The soundtrack is a beautiful condiment to the the countless heartstopping moments encountered throughout the game. The journey was, throughout the trilogy of Mass Effect, truly memorable- watching the effects of your decisions, building friendships, sacrificing for 'the greater good', and living with your mistakes. I have come to admire BioWare's ability to make a gamer love a character, only to lose them. There are, however, imperfections with Mass Effect 3, much like any other game. Many of these problems had little affect on me. The most important problem I had in the game was with the ending. What I, as well as many other ME vets, was expecting was a beautiful ending that would have me thinking for hours, about my decisions, and what I could have done to change the end. Nothing of the sort occurred. It wasn't a great ending. It wasn't terrible, but after that ending, one should not be thinking 'Whatever, now what?' It was inconclusive, felt rushed, and lacked consistency with previous games and media concerning the series, as well as with what BioWare said themselves. The endings were all very alike, which I found disappointing. However, it took away nothing from the game for me. I strongly recommend buying this game, even if you are scared of disappointment from the ending. I will continue to play BioWare games and believe they will learn from this mistake.",10,2012-03-20,XBOX 360,user

czombie,"This game obviously doesn't deserve a 0 or 1 rating, but to say that the ending was extremely disappointing is an understatement. At the game's end, I felt like I didn't really have a choice at all, despite what was advertised by Bioware and what consistently occurred throughout all three of the titles in the series. I think it's apparent that they are eventually going to make an alternate ending with more choices, as they are going to lose a ton of money in DLC if they don't. The conspiracy theorist in me thinks that this was their plan all along, to get more people to buy a better ending as DLC. If the DLC costs anything, I'm done with Bioware, but a free DLC alternate ending with some actual choices will let me forgive them because, besides the ending, this is a good game.",4,2012-03-20,XBOX 360,user
discodave91,"No improvement on Mass Effect 2. Just a re-hash of the last game. The mission system is terrible. You have no idea what stage you are at in the missions or where to go. The side quest are, again, re-hashes of the online multi-player. Some of the aspects of furthering the story are quite good up to a point. Then the game has the most stupid, uneducated, simplistic, disappointing ending I have ever seen in a game. It takes no account of the lore of the game, makes no sense, would result in everyone being stranded and most of the systems being destroyed along with everyone that you were trying to save, and your choices make no difference to the ending of the game. Even though its an A,B,C ending, they are all pretty much identical! Bio Ware used to be great, but now they seem to have a knack at ruining their games (look at Dragon Age 2). EA are probably to blame. The whole game was also very buggy. At one point I had 2 Edi's, Tali died and then came back from the dead in a love seen??? and doors would randomly take an age to open. Sometimes powers and squad commands did not work! To sum up, the entire game felt rushed, was buggy, and had a generic ending that made no sense. Very disappointing.",0,2012-03-20,XBOX 360,user

It's not that the ending is depressing or even bittersweet, as PR would have it spun; The ending makes zero sense - it flies in the face of it's own canon and creates numerous plot holes in the last ten minutes alone. To top it all off, the defining element of Mass Effect, choice, is stripped away from you. No choice you agonized over has any consequence. . If you're a fan of the series and absolutely cannot bring yourself to wait to play this, do yourself a favor and either rent ME3, or purchase a used copy at your local Gamestop and return it before seven days are up to get your money back.

It's ruined by the ending, which really is as bad as you've heard. It's 5 minutes pretentious, non-nonsensical garbage masquerading as avant-garde, postmodernist Cosmicism that negates all the decisions you've made, forces Shepard to speak and act out of character to enact one of several virtually identical and equally ridiculous endings. It offers no explanation, no closure, no sense of accomplishment, no epilogue and makes absolutely no sense. All it does is leave the player feeling betrayed and robbed. I can't believe this ending was created by the brilliant writers of the first two games. Oh wait, that's because it's not: those writers write for The Old Republic now.

Plaidman86,"I thoroughly enjoy the Mass Effect series and I absolutely could not wait to see what was in store for the galaxy with the foreboding presence of the imminent Reaper invasion and all out extermination of all the organic races. This game had so much building up, so much hype, and at first glance all was going so well...until the ending. First off I do say this game has many improvements from ME2 (storywise and gameplay), I love it how there's more RPG element (leveling, skill trees) and the weapon modding was a very nice welcome which allows you to tailor your guns to different situations. I loved all the cameo appearances from squad mates past and present as well as other characters encountered in past games and including DLC which was very nice. The controls actually seemed a bit worse than 2, I've died so many times due to squad mates being in the way and non-responsive controls. It got really irritating moving from cover to cover or peaking out and being punished for the game having a good 1-2 second delay. I noticed that Shepard can now vault or tumble like Gears of War (I forget if he could do that in 2...) and it seems like Bioware really likes Gears. The galaxy map was just about the same as 2's minus scanning for minerals/resources and having a set amount of probes. However, because the Reapers are out and about it can make scanning annoying. I also liked it how you didn't have a billion squad mates to pick from like 2, and I'm glad to see 3 took a notion of quality vs. quantity. As for the story, I could feel from the start of the game how dark the situation was, and how close the galaxy was to coming closer and closer to failure and ultimate extinction. It got a little irritating dealing with Cerberus a good half of the game, I mean really who is the focus here? Cerberus or the Reapers? Although it was interesting to hear about the humans fighting against themselves as opposed to working together. I also liked making choices to bring the other races together. I thought the story flowed very well, much better than 2's ""out of nowhere"" plot. Everything just kept building up, but then the ending came... Yes, I do have to hop on the growing band wagon and agree that the ending to ME3 was really not that good. I don't have a problem with the three choices you are presented with at the end and that Shepard dies (so sad and **** he dies!) but I have a major problem with how short the ending is and the lack of closure on all the supporting characters and the general fate and conclusion of the Mass Effect universe. Not to mention I was also greatly disappointed to see, or NOT see, how my preparations for the final assault didn't even make a difference. I was fairly certain I heard Admiral Hackett go from saying, ""We're bogged down"" to ""We're about even"" so I figured maybe this would impact the final mission or ending, but it didn't! So did I make all those choices and finish all those side quests for nothing? I felt nothing but emptiness when the game ended, it reminded me of early reviews of Halo 2 and how many reviewers commented on how the ending left you wanting more. Unfortunately for this series there is no more to be had as it's the last to the trilogy. I find it interesting hearing that the overall dissatisfaction with ME3's ending by many, MANY fans has been well heard, and some has gone so far as to raise a charity to bring awareness and change to 3's ending! Of course Bioware is listening but so far they're saying they have no plans to alter the ending but to only support 3 with future DLC. (Sigh...) I really want to rate this game a 10 as it was enjoyable to play, but the ending just ruins it, especially since your choices and quests during the game have no effect. Because of that, I'm actually having a hard time playing through the game again because I now know whatever I do on the side won't make a difference and won't reward me with extra cutscenes, dialogue, etc. I almost wanna rate this game a 7 but I think that would be a bit steep. Had this game had a perfect ending I would have given it a 10. But that bad ending just creates one hell of a void that really just hampers everything else this game has to offer, and I say all this because this game is an RPG and RPGs are supposed to have critical character and plot development. Overall, good game but not what I had in mind to close such a wonderful series. Here's to hoping future DLC will improve what faults there are.",8,2012-03-20,XBOX 360,user

I have watched my room mate play, I have watched my friends play and their story is not the same as mine. The decisions you made in the first two games do have an impact on the final playthrough. Like I said, the only negative about this game is all of these trollers hating on it because it ends...even though they have been foreshadowing this for 5 years.

Hafaza,"As a longtime fan of the Mass Effect series it is painful for me to give this game such a low rating. The fact is that while the majority of the game is very good, though not without its shortcomings, the finale of Mass Effect 3 is atrocious; riddled with plot-holes and contradictions, vague, unsatisfying, non-sensical, and ultimately left me feeling bitter and empty. The most obvious strength of ME3, like previous installments, is its characters. The voice actors bring them to life masterfully (if of course you ignore the shameless inclusion of a certain IGN personality), and they are rounded and interesting enough to make you genuinely care about them. The story is fairly simple, but easy to follow, and grand in its scope; after discovering the plans for an ultimate weapon, you must rally the races of the galaxy, resolve long-standing grudges, and bring them together to combat the Reapers while this weapon is constructed. There are some exciting, cinematic moments, and it is very satisfying to see events and characters from the previous games melded into the narrative, even if some of these are only token, or cameo, appearances. The combat is very similar to ME2, with various tweaks that improve the system. It's much more challenging this time around, and I found myself constantly experimenting with my load-outs right up until the final moments. The quest system is very poorly implemented. Many scanning side quests will be heaped on you just by overhearing conversations as you walk through the Citadel, and there is no way to track your progress. With the lack of any real context, it makes the side quests rather tedious. There are also very few characters available as squadmates, when compared to the previous games. Two of which are only available about half way through the game, and another only if you buy the From Ashes DLC. Generally, I couldn't help but feel that many elements of this game were clumsily put together, but it all seems to work nonetheless. These gripes, however, are irrelevant when held against the ending. What truly makes it such a travesty, aside from all the ridiculous lapses in logic that the ending is rife with, (and all the lies it now seems we were told by Bioware prior to release), is that it totally overshadows and negates the many positive aspects of the series that have come before it. All the characters you've come to care about, all the relationships you've built, all the hard choices and sacrifices you've had to make, and all the problems you've solved, ultimately all mean nothing. This is the reason for such a low-scored review, and the reason why so many others are doing likewise; the aspects that made Mass Effect great are all scrapped and tarnished in the final hour in favour of a pseudo-philosophical, nihilistic, non-sensical conclusion. Bioware even have the audacity to leave you a little message after the credits role telling you to buy more DLC. Disgusting. The 30 hours of enjoyment you'll get from most of the game are not enough to justify the final emptiness it will leave you with. It is simply not worth it.",4,2012-03-20,XBOX 360,user
Whyohwhy,"I went into ME3 expecting another repetitious game along the same style of ME2. I liked ME2 for it's story but the missions itself didn't feel good as it was just ""get this guy, get this guy, now get that same guy loyal, now the next one, onwards and onwards"" I got tired of it, and hoped that ME3 would refrain from such tactics. I was happy to see a heavy emphasis on the story and drama of galactic politics. I was intrigued by their different characters shown and the way they decidede that more characters wasn't better. Instead they focused on the continuation of the story and the characters of whom we allready knew. Speaking of which, my favorite moments of this game have been in relation to previous characters. There were two in particular that made me more emotionally connected to a character of a video game before. I didn't feel like it was very tacked on the way the earlier characters reappered since it was very varied. Sometimes you would do a simple sidemission and get caught up in helping an earlier teammate escape a facility that you had expected to be a simple get-in get-out quest. Would i recommend this game? Hell yes. This game is great because Bioware decided to focus on what they do best, a great story with great dialogue. I didn't expect this game to be as good as it was. Since this is also a hot-topic i feel like i can't leave this out, the ending. As far as i can tell people are up in arms about how nothing they did mattered in the end. I have a feeling those people weren't really thinking straight sometimes, because who cares if you saved the Rachni in ME1 when they propably wouldn't / couldn't do anything against the reapers anyway.

The only real gripe I have for the game is the one new character who feels too much like The Situation. Otherwise the games greatest achievement is the vast amounts of great characters.

Dbuntu,"How do you train-wreck a great game and series, 100+ hours of solid story, character development, and gameplay in the span of half an hour? There were so many positives about Mass Effect 3 that are completely overshadowed by the ending. It leaves me wondering why I bothered to go back and play 1&2 again making sure I had all the choices I wanted right when at the end, it didn't really matter. Maybe there is some point being made about the inescapability of destiny, but it feels tacked on. Maybe Bioware had a sudden religious awakening and decided they needed to hammer the idea home with all the subtly of a Krogan battle-master. Whatever the case, the last half hour of Mass Effect 3 comes out of nowhere, ignores all previous choices, and fails to resolve the character's stories. Plus it just doesn't make any godamn sense. A real shame to see a series I was so fond of for five years suddenly fall apart so utterly. Even if Bioware does release a DLC ""fix"" I'm not sure how much I'd want it. This was a stain on their reputation and while a fix might ease the pain a bit, so does Astroglide.",4,2012-03-19,XBOX 360,user
Masseffectfan1,This wraps up the mass effect trilogy in a perfect way (apart from the endings) which will hopefully be patched at a later date via DLC and what have you got an amazing brilliant game Stop complaining about the ending and before you say anything i have been a fan of the mass effect series since ME1 First came out and Bioware since KOTOR. Okay now onto the ending yes I agree we needed more closure but bioware know this and who knows this may have been wanted all along to get the ending so talked about that when they release a DLC for the ending everyone will get it. Bioware are smart have faith!,9,2012-03-19,XBOX 360,user
skinny_mean_man,Mass effect is my favorite next gen console series. but mass effect 3 is a middle finger to the fans who have loved the series since day one. unless something is seriously done to fix this game i will never buy from bioware again. they were my favorite company and now they are my most hated.,0,2012-03-19,XBOX 360,user
Ventus,"Mass Effect 3 is a revamped version of ME2 combat and nothing more. Virtually none of the choices made in ME1 or ME2 are taken into account, and a fresh ME3 characters game experience is nearly identical. Plots holes and generally a lack of vision with the 3 possible endings make any invested effort a waste of time. If I had to sum the game up I would say ""lazy"" is about right, with a dash of ""the ILLUSION of choice"", since you don't actually impact the plot with your choices. The sheer number of public domain images you can google (or find on getty images) that are used in the game are shocking (is it really so hard to draw your own picture of an alien for Tali, or use some of the great user images out there? Rather than use a getty images, barely photoshop'ed picture of a human?). The gameplay was fun. The multiplayer was the most enjoyable aspect for me. Story wise, this is not a ""Bioware"" game as we remember the golden era of quality Bioware games. It's just not the same company anymore. Mass Effect 2.5 is worth a rent, at best.",0,2012-03-19,XBOX 360,user
A_Person,"When I see all these glowing reviews by game websites giving it nigh perfect scores, its glaringly obvious that their integrity and objectivity is compromised. In fact its almost comical how much the websites try and cover for its flaws. My favorite was one where they condemned bioware changing the endings because ""oh its art you'll ruin it by changing the ending."" I like to think that if somehow a 6 year old drew a big turd on the Mona Lisa, the museum would do everything it could to restore the painting by TAKING OUT THE BIG TURD ON IT. What they are really praising isn't the game it is the amount of money they received in advertising from the game's publisher. Mass Effect 3's ending (because its really only one) is a slap in the face, a total disgrace to the brand. Whoever the lead writer was for the ending, and whoever gave the okay for that crap needs to be fired. Furthermore I've never encountered an ending that made me hope for a cliched ""It was all a dream"" sequence as much as this one. This ending is so poorly put together it is on par with the likes of Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions, wer're talking total plot and lore breakdown. The final offense was the after credit sequence which just adds insult to injury. The only person that could of made a poorer ending was George Lucas.",0,2012-03-19,XBOX 360,user
Drop_in_Ninja,"After completing Mass Effect 1 and 2 multiple times in preparation for the epic conclusion, I was extremely pleased with how everything all turned out. The changes made from ME2 to ME3 were welcome ones. No more hacking or bypassing mini-games, or terribly long loading screens. Some of the RPG aspects from ME1 returned and made the game more customizable and personable. The Multiplayer component surprised me when I first played it and I was immediately hooked. The leveling and upgrade systems are well constructed and easy to get a grasp of. There were multiple events in the story that were so beautifully constructed and well orchestrated that I just had to sit back in my chair and revel in all of its glory. I have never felt so connected to a story and characters in a game. Many complain about the ending. These opinions are simply based on ignorance and a ""I didn't get the exact ending I wanted so I'm going to complain"" response. Did I get exactly what I wanted? No, I didn't. Was I still able to appreciate the overall ending while seeing the beauty of it and accept it for what it was? Yes!",10,2012-03-19,XBOX 360,user
ImUnavailable,"A beautiful, thrilling and flawed conclusion to the Mass Effect trilogy. ME3 does not disappoint when it comes to intense action set pieces and an epic story. The abundant drama in this game feels earned after playing the previous games in the series and it is nice to see the decisions made in those games impacting on this one. Multiplayer is a surprisingly effective addition, with a great range of character classes, races and unlockables to keep you hooked. The main problem with ME3 is the character interaction. Shepard's team is not as memorable as before, with few new faces onboard. Conversation options with them are fairly shallow and you miss the loyalty missions of ME2. The exclusion of the latter is understandable since Shepard is on a tight schedule to stop the Reapers. But it is still disappointing. Overall, though, I still greatly enjoyed playing this game and hope to play it again soon. Mass Effect has been the greatest video game trilogy of all time and ME3 is a worthy end to the saga.",9,2012-03-19,XBOX 360,user
Flamewielder,"Up to the finale, ME3 felt like the natural continuity of the previous 2 installments. Great music, improved visuals (in spite of a few minor glitches), obvious efforts were made to make the fans feel at home and bring closure to the story. The characters feel like old friends and you're happy to see them one last time. The design team did a fantastic job of it. Then, 5 minutes before the end, the designers break the compact made with the players that made ME an interactive art form by taking control of YOUR Shepard's story. The conclusion felt obviously rushed and writers obviously forgot that since ME is YOUR Shepard's story, YOU should decide how it all ends... sad, bittersweet or happy should be YOUR choice. And that's why I give it a 9, rather than the 10 I would have otherwise given it. Good news is: that can be fixed through a patch or DLC.",9,2012-03-19,XBOX 360,user

It's obvious to me now that the majority of people do not understand the endings and how they work into the universe.

I am certain we will see 'the Truth' in some form of DLC, and that makes me all the more excited.

CheeseHead,"While I enjoyed Mass Effect 3 and would recommend it for people to try out, the ending was a crushing blow to the face: none of my decisions mattered, nothing was explained, all the endings were virtually identical, Bioware used a ""in your face, deus ex machina"" to wrap it all up. The ending did not stay true to the game, the trilogy or the fans. Worst of all, the ending ruins any replayability for most fans. Of course there were several positive things to the game, but since many are considered spoilers I will not be posting them. It's painful for me to do this, but since the ending is truly all that stays with you (and not in a good way) I must give this game a negative rating.",3,2012-03-19,XBOX 360,user

BOSTONJOHN32,"Well i will start by saying that im amazed that critics scored this game nearly perfect but not many went into detail about ending, never mention it @ all or simply (and boldly) allowed readers to think the game was great from start to finish, then i happened 2 go ""outside the bubble"" and found smaller, more obscure reviews and the score factored in that the ending was ""literary suicide"" as one wrote. as quoted by r. ebert ""if you had to ask what it symbolized, then it didnt"" and i can say that this very much sums up the ending, struck in awe like many, i wasnt even sure if i had beat the game and had to check mt trophy in order to sort out if i did. thats just it, i felt like i did not know what had just happened and had to wait for the credits to scroll to know its over,and so i convince myself that ok maybe i just did not see the right ending and maybe i got the bad ending, ""yes that must be it, w/ so many endings i must have screwed up along the way and got the bad ending"" come to find out i got the desired and the most ""definative"" ending.. so then i go back and replay the mission etc and all the other endings are pretty much identical beside a different color or ""end sequence"" which consisted of a minute or so animation of walking another direction etc. i wont get into conspiracy theories or anything which is out of context but its kind of hard not to fall prey or offer self to some distraction or debate because we not only invested time, we invested emotion.. hours upon hours of carefully making right choices for a desired import etc, and for what? if i kind of got a heads up from critics that ""decisions do not play as significant a role in mass 3 as it did in the prior 2"" then i wouldve been able to prepare,lol.. but we are hearing words like art, story telling masterpiece also we were told by bioware that this would have multiple endings, a deeper consequence/decision mechanic, an end which would the opposite from lost, well no it may actually take the belt away from lost for the wtf just happened moment but the fact is that i shouldve known that a game which has a formula that works almost seamlessly, based primarily on decisions as well as story driven sequences which make the gamer care, think and DECIDE, it works so good that while i played every mass efect i made every decision carefully to prep my shep for the import into the next game, so if i am playing a game and already thinking of the next one then the system is almost flawless imo.. BUT it is obvious E.A had a bit of influence and brings me back to my point with this ""formula"", they deserted it and decided for MASS APPEAL rather than mass effect and i noticed this during the demo and how much emphasis was put on how one can play the game how one wishes and that the game can be toggled to suit any style, dont like stories? choose combat.. hate decisions? well you can toggle that too.. but wait, isnt that the part of mass effect which makes it like few others? and isnt that what i have spent many hours doing to have a desired and effective playthrough as well as end? was it just me or did it feel silly to scan planets this time around? as to say ""hey dont want to waste time scanning for elements, well we fixed that too"" huh? call me a loser, call me what you want BUT i enjoyed taking my time scanning for minerals and elements and launching probes with a feeling of purpose, because that was one of the many things which made me love this game, felt like what i did mattered and fulfilling. i can understand E.A 's stance from a business perspective, their knowledge and tactics of knowing that the fanbase of mass effect are going to buy this game regardless so lets find some fresh blood, but did the solid core and fan base have to feel jipped, let down, disappointed, confused and as well as angry in exchange for new profits/gains? well the core, the fans well we are mass effect. it breaths because we let it, we let it because it was great ,brought quality and emotion and stood apart from many other games and the exp was one like few others. but as much respect a game/developer may get through time can be undone in ten minutes.. i can not say that mass effect 3 was a bad game, but after putting in hours of decisions, careful choices to have it not effect anything in regards to the end , other than the war assets and ""co-op""readiness , well i feel like it was more of a ""okay hurry up and get this over with and go play co-op after"" the fact remains that mass effect 3 is still a solid game, but an ending which was promised to be the finale we dream about also being admittedly rushed well how does anything rushed ever result to anything other than sub par to par? a game is about the exp, mass effect is about a unique and gripping exp BUT the end ruined both.. its obvious a lot has changed in the gaming industry in the past 5 years, mass effect supports this in every respect, reapers went from FEAR INDUCING to PAWNS",6,2012-03-19,XBOX 360,user

BillJaguar,"Now then. I shall start off by saying that 10/10 is not actually my score for this game, however I do believe it deserves more than it's current score (4.9 at this time), so I have given it 10 to help even these user scores out. My score would actually be around a 6, maybe a 7. So what shall I start with? ""Don't get me wrong I'm a a fan of the series...""? ""I loved the first two but...""? ""It's (something obscenely negative)""? I could but I would be lying. I am a newcomer to this series starting at three. Some would say I'm an fool, however the reason is because I have never paid attention to the series so far, but have finally been attracted to the scenario. Sci-fi, aliens, space travel... marvelous (and frightening) stuff, all in a game. There have, of course, been many games featuring these assets, but Mass Effect 3 makes it all the more tangible. Especially for one with a lack of imagination such as myself. The galaxy map is an especially beautiful aspect of the game to look at, (look at the pretty colours!). Therefore to me, this setting is very compelling, because ultimately it is where I believe humanity would like to be going next. That is just my view but i feel that it is correct, it is certainly where I want to be. Now the game itself. It is actually a very simple game, which could work in its favour or it is boring. On the other kidney though, all games can be made simplistic if you try, but I won't. What I will say is this: linearity is quite prevalent. If you are comfortable with games though then this isn't too much of a problem. However for someone who hasn't been with the series it is pretty limited in it's replay value. The graphics look like a game and I'm fine with that, even if their movements are quite robotic. The characters are very appealing, we have aliens not just humans, so they should be. Garrus has been my favourite since I did a bit of background reading before getting this game, such is the charm of this universe. The one thing that has irked and irritated is the galaxy at war feature, which for me (online code and all) consistently says: ""system offline"". Wildly vexing for my inner achievement trawler. Thus I'm not sure if it makes the end of the game any easier. Since I'm here the contentious issue of the ending... My view is that it was odd. That's it. I didn't hate it, for me it was just odd. (No spoilers here though). The multiplayer was very disappointing. I played the demo with the multiplayer and what happened apparently is that I had played (impending random percentage) 70% of the actual multiplayer. On the demo there were two maps and you were fighting Cerberus on bronze, silver or gold difficulty. In the full game, there are perhaps 6 levels with Reapers and Geth joining the fray. It will be very appealing to GOW Horde fans and all alike. Instead for myself, who views the variety of Timesplitters 2 multiplayer modes as more engrossing than the Horde and unlocking aspects this was a great disappointment. Nevertheless, functionally, the multiplayer is just fine, (aside my Galaxy at War being constantly inactive). There we have it, my semi-indifferent thoughts on this game. As mentioned in my intro, my real score is 7/10, but 10/10 to help in levelling off the unfairly assigned 0/10 reviews. Thank you for reading, Bill Jaguar",10,2012-03-19,XBOX 360,user
ukiome,"Having played and experienced all three games in this trilogy I had high expectations for the final installment. My first impression was a bit negative as I had not played the ME3 DLC arrival and therefore did not have any idea what was going on with Shepard and the team when the game started. I would have liked a more graphical background story to get me up to date. However, you instantly get into action against the reapers and from there it just gets better. It seems that the developers have listened a lot to their fans from every game and the results are always pros and cons. This game seems to have been focused on making things easier for players as the sidequests are shorter but still enjoyable. There are ""fetch-quests"" that really don't mean anything as you wander around the citadel and accidentally stumbles on a person that wants some space-part that you happen to have found on some planet somewhere... But the meat lies with the story and the action in this game. Those parts work really great. The combat has been improved as you can move a lot smother on the field and the action just really flows. The story is as always great an engaging. I must say, as having read all the negative remarks to the ending, that I respect the developers decision to make the ending as they did. I had low expectations going in to the ending thanks to all the whining being done by respectfulness fans of the series but I did not at all see what the big deal was. I don't want to spoil anything about the end so I'll just say that the game leaves parts to your imagination but that doesn't mean its a bad thing. I understand how a lot of people were disappointed in the endings but It gives no right to call developers names and demand that they make changes. They have delivered a great series that just keeps impressing on you. I can't even imagine the amount of work they have put into these games. Bioware - I am one of your many fans that thank your for this experience. I've given the series over 100 hours of play and It is one of my best investments ever.

reVICES,"Mass Effect 3, as a whole, lives up to the hype of what the ground breaking series has given us so far. The game improves upon its predecessor in almost every way, however it falls short on a few aspects that make this game not the perfect ten it could have been. One aspect that this entry greatly improves upon is the combat. You now have many more ways to strategically take down your foes. With the additions of combat rolls and jumping from cover to cover gives you opportunities to dodge devastating enemy attacks and to close in on opponents in ways that were never possible before. Weapons customization gives you the possibility of making combat situations more personalized to the individual gamer's weaknesses, an element that was removed entirely from the second installment. Another great addition is the use of the Xbox 360's Kinect device. The player can now literately shout commands to their squad mates in the heat of battle. Although, one negative can be found in this during the use of the dialogue wheel. If you are having a conversation with someone in the room with you, it may recognize what you say as one of the options, and it could possibly select an undesired choice. Also, I've noticed that it sometimes will pick up conversations from the game itself, and the microphone icon will flash. Melee combat is better evolved but can sometimes be glitch resulting in missing your target entirely. On to the RPG elements of the game next. Much like the combat, many improvements were made here, that cannot be said for all aspects though, and this is the root of many of the game's shortcomings. The skill tree in this installment is much larger and includes unique options that were not seen in the previous installments, giving players additional options to think about while leveling their characters. The dialogue in the game seems to have taken a major hit from the previous installments. The voice acting was done very well but it doesn't make up for the lack of conversation options throughout the game. In the previous installments you can talk to all of your squad members in between missions and develop the way you want your Shepard to treat that squad member. However, in Mass Effect 3 they have greatly limited these encounters in some cases to one or two times you can choose what to say to your party. It's possible that the creators thought that talking to every party member in between missions was tedious, but developing the individuality of your Shepard is what made the series so ingenious. Another RPG element that took a hit in the finale is the side missions. A vast majority of what would've been called ""assignments"" in the previous installments are nothing but fetch quests in this game. As you travel the Citadel, you will overhear many conversations, and many of them Shepard believes he should take it upon himself to help them. These always require you to fly to system and start scanning, or go to the Spectre Requisitions and just buy something. Despite it helping your overall mission, many of these just come off as unnecessary annoyances. The reputation system within the game also seems to have taken a hit since its predecessor. Overall, it almost just seems like it was removed entirely with the exception of a few key decisions. Lastly, the biggest criticism of the game so far, the endings. Theories aside, if they are intended to be interpreted literately this is a major short coming. None of the endings really give the player any closure for a series that many people have participated in from the series beginning. Despite that, one of the selling points of the series is that every choice you make matters. The few endings of the game are all preset and none of the choices Shepard has made effect the ending, taking away any individuality you've given your Shepard throughout the span of the series. Perhaps these issues will be addressed in the near future, and this negative point will no longer be necessary. Despite the controversy surrounding the endings, the day one downloadable content, the completely optional same-sex relationship possibilities, this game does deserve universal acclaim. If it wasn't for the few short comings, this would be strongest entry in an already very well done series.",9,2012-03-19,XBOX 360,user

psykeron,"It has been quite a journey. can't talk about everything due to the ltd. space. no spoilers. -------The Combat 9/10------- The combat is visibly better than all ME1 and 2. The level design is awesome. There are many ways to attack a situation. In the Grissom Academy level at one stage you can choose to go for an all out ground attack or take out people on the stairs and rain hell from above. The combat is just fluid and nice. -------The Locations 9/10------- I believe ME3 offers many unique locations compared to ME1&2 (you are free to correct me here). The locations were just breathtaking and well designed. Visiting the temple of Althame and many many others that I don't want to spoil for you. -------The Story and The World 7/10------- The story in mass effect is good but it pales in comparison to ME1 and ME2. And I'm sure that you will agree that ME2's story pales in comparison to ME1. The problem with ME3 is that the game doesn't let you connect with the story. You go on big mission from one planet to the other and that is about it. The player doesn't get the chance to feel for his/her galaxy. The story in ME1 and ME2 were good because I could connect to the world through short missions and random conversations. In ME3, I did not connect. There were no small stories and missions that made me feel like I was a part of this world. Just to highlight my point, an Elcor ambassador will plead you to save his people from his homeworld. This particular mission got me excited. I believed that I was going to land on the Elcor homeworld and save them but that never happened. I just scanned their planet and they were magically saved. This is what made me really lose that connection to the world of Mass Effect. Mass Effect 3 offers no new species and cultures for you to explore. Remember in ME1 and 2 where you landed on an unexplored planet to find something awesome, that connection is what made them so awesome. ME3 really lacks in making that connection and making you feel and live the story. -------The Characters 5/10------- I am very disappointed in the characters. For those of you who played ME2, and had Zaeed Masani as a squad mate. Remember how he would say random things when you clicked on him. There weren't many dialog options and therefore there was no deep connection with Zaeed Masani. Now just expand that situation to every character in Mass Effect 3. In ME3, you have a few conversations using the wheel; after that you just go press 'A' and the character will say something and then you press 'A' again and so on. There is no connection and no immersion in the conversation and the characters. In ME1 and 2, the conversation wheel was a way of making you part of the conversation. Even if there were no new dialog options, I would still try to start a conversation with a team member. The fact that they looked at me and acknowledged my willingness to start a conversation made me feel connected to them as my team mates(in ME1&2). In ME3, the lack of conversation really bugged me. Its what I admired the series for and here it was non-existent. I am sure all of you let Kaidan die in ME1, I think it was because he didn't have many conversations with us in the game. In ME3, I feel this way about all the squad members. The only reason I feel a connection to some of the characters in ME3 is because of my past experiences with them. -------Mission 8/10------- there are only two kinds of missions in ME3: main missions and fetch missions. The main missions are part of the story and that is pretty self explanatory. The fetch missions are the worst missions ever made in ME history. You don't talk to people to get fetch missions. You get missions as you overhear conversations and these missions involve scanning worlds to find items. -------The Ending 10/10------- The game was a chore in a lot of ways but the ending was awesome. I know a lot of people are complaining about the ending; that the ending didn't account for all the choices you made during the game. If people are talking about the events leading up to the ending, then yeah the consequences of your choices could have been reflected better. But that is a problem with the story telling and not the ending. I was disconnected from the world of ME3 for the most part of the game but the ending pulled me right back into it. It was the only moment that I felt connected to the game. I felt my heart leap, feelings of joy & sorrow, my choices and adventures flashed before my mind's eye, I reminisced about the people I had met on my long journey, the conversations, the connections, the love and the hate. It all just rushed back to me and I shed a tear as i saw the consequences of 'my choice' unfold itself. In the end, I felt that I had made a difference in my world, I felt that I was Commander John Shepard.

dbnp,"This game does not deserve a 10/10, nor a 94 metacritic rating. Your adventure begins with the reapers attacking earth, the first planet to come under siege. After the confirmation of the reaper invasion as so prophesized by Shepard, you are tasked with uniting the entire universe in not getting annhilated. But throughout the entire game you'll feel like Shepard and his crew are the only people in the ENTIRE universe who are taking the whole galaxy obliteration thing seriously. You'll spend the entire game doing favors for the other races who apparently don't give a **** that they and everything they've ever known or loved will die, so long as X objective is fulfilled. And throughout, you'll find plotholes so massive a Geth dreadnought (which is surprisingly accommodating to lifeforms) could fly through them. The Rachni are back, regardless of whether you killed the queen in ME1, for example. As for the ending... it's so bad Bioware issued a statement for damage control. Don't worry though, they intend to give you the ending you deserve so long as you buy yet another DLC pack. The graphics only look good when the image on screen is static. Try dodging, moving from cover to cover, sprinting, or watching 90% of the cut-scenes and you'll see awful animations, horrible transitions from animation to animation, and sometimes awkward eye movements. And regardless of whether you cleared out all enemies in a conflict zone, the camera still follows Shepard with his gun drawn uncomfortable close, and even with the controller sensitivity setting at ""low"" (yes, this game, unlike every other shooter released in the past decade, has only 3 settings for analog stick sensitivity) I found myself getting dizzy playing. There are also cinematic events during levels much like the Uncharted series but with choppy animation and crappy camera angles. If you're a fan of claustrophobia and nausea, then you'll love exploring M3E's environments for credits and weapon upgrades. The entire game feels tight and constricted, from beginning to end. Imagine the linearity of Gears of War with about 50% less space. And the locations that should be sprawling and massive, like the Citadel for example, feel miniscule and require an elevator and a loading screen to access each of the five zones Shepard may explore. Even the outside levels, of which there are only a few, channel you through invisible walls to your objective. In addition, small sections of the map are regurgitated throughout the entire level to save development time, adding to the disorientation. Multiplayer is a welcome addition, but it too has its faults. The gear you can upgrade includes weapons and their mods, but no armor, and getting said gear is either a massive grind or expensive. Gear is attained by buying ""packs"" which are essentially booster decks filled randomly with equipment using either MS points or the game's own credit system, which are earned extremely slowly by completing various objectives during multiplayer sessions. It's sickening how shamelessly Bioware fills its own pocket with this system and it creates a rift between players willing to spend money on digital items and players who won't, and the chance of you attaining what you desire for your character are slim, forcing you to buy pack after pack. But the loot system isn't the only thing that feels broken and wrong. Instead of creating a character and class from scratch and choosing and building upon its buffs and abilities, there are 4 or 5 characters for each class, two or 3 with their own special abilities, and each class levels up independently from each other. It isn't the worst system in the world, but you'll feel less attached to each of your many online avatars as you do with Shepard. This also prevents players from creating the exact class/character they desire, as only certain races have access to certain abilities. If you were looking to make a human with Reave, you're SOL. And, unlike the singleplayer campaign, each class has a max of three abilities which cannot be remapped to different buttons. You are stuck using your abilities (but only in multiplayer) with the buttons Bioware chose. Just as perplexing is the lack of a mute option. I cannot stress how absolutely stupid Bioware is for not adding this and many other features that are status quo. I hope you enjoy your multiplayer experience dashed with thirteen year old kids and racists. Mass 3 Effect is a good game by any standard, but it is not a great game, and the lack of certain options that are standard in every game released in the past decade certainly don't help. But it's the ending and Bioware's disgusting Activision-like business tactics that'll eventually disenchant you from its massive, plot-hole riddled world. Or maybe seeing Ronnie from Jersey Shore joining your crew will do it.",1,2012-03-18,XBOX 360,user

linksmaster,"After completing the game one has to wonder whether Bioware diverted all their resources to Star Wars - The Old Republic. One can only hope that is the excuse for this ending to the series. Regardless of the excuses or, perish the thought these ""endings"" were actually planned out, the Nihilistic ending made me regret having spent time even bothering to develop a character. Perhaps it's a joke. Or a calculated business move to offer DLC that lets you have an ending where you actually have some impact. As such this mess is such a shame for what had been such a promising series. In my humble opinion it is that bad. And it's sad. Not the sadness of any ending but the saddest thing in the world: Wasted potential. The wasted potential from a sloppy meaningless ending to an otherwise previously well executed series. I have lost the will to replay Mass Effect due to the ending. If that was Bioware's (and/or EA's) intentions, then well played EA/Bioware. I won't bother to return.

It came down to A B or C option. Either way everything is over with the universe. It was out of character and confusing. The ending was being written during the whole game and was culminating into a spectacular ending. However this was thrown away. For a modern cliche twist ending.

Who cares? BioWare may have backed themselves into a corner with how much variability is possible in a character, but they do a fantastic job carrying everything through to this final chapter. Sure, the ending of the game is short, but at least it's somewhat conclusive. Besides, it's a wild ride to get there and journey worth experiencing.

The minor is the loading times/screens, too many and too often but I could have lived with this as I was so engrossed in gathering my troops for the final battle for earth. The major problems is the ending.

In Mass Effect 2, you had several planets to explore and interact with. In Mass Effect 3, you only get one area: The Citadel. It feels like you really have no room to explore in the universe. Random banter across the citadel tends to repeat, taking away from the immersion factor of this game. Side quests are aquired by listening to conversations on the citadel. Tracking them is a hassle. Shooting and moving is more improved from Mass Effect 2, and multiplayer actually works. However, the entire series gives you the illusion that your choices will shape the galaxy.

Makavelli96,"Mass Effect 3 is the ending to an incredible series of sci-fi games, and it falls short of being anything but a money-grab by EA/Bioware. Pros: its a video game. Cons: weird character animations, incredibly annoying camera angles during cut-scenes, too many FMV cut-scenes ruin the pacing, choppy frame rates, laughable and childish dialogue, hit or miss voice acting, out-dated graphics and textures, generic 3rd person shooter combat is outdated and ""rusty"", no attempt at being ""scientific"" like the last 2 games, most RPG elements are gone, no holstering your weapon, barely any dialogue choices, horrible story and narrative... here, how about a shorter list: 1. Mass Effect 3 is an incomplete, falling-apart-at-the-seams game, piggybacked onto a massively popular franchise simply to sell it to fans of the series. 2. The ending is atrociously **** it doesn't even fit. It makes everything you just did, every choice you just made in the whole series literally pointless. 3. Data was on the disk, removed, and repacked as $10-15 DLC on the day the game was released. This is NOT acceptable and I am never buying another Bioware game simply because of this, until they quit this nonsense. Developers will NOT extort money out of gamers, this stops now. No debate. 4. Speaking of bad game design and boycotting, I won't be an accomplice in the ""Hollywoodization"" of the gaming industry. Mass Effect 3 thinks its a movie: The camera angles zooming on character's lifeless faces, the narrative, the cut-scenes every 5 minutes, **** pathetic. Any one of those high quality cut-scenes costs more money for developers to create, than I make in an entire decade of paychecks. Why wasn't any of that money allocated to upgrading gameplay mechanics, instead of trying to make a friggin' movie? These scenes last a few minutes, take up tons of space on the disks, and in the end will be even more outdated in less than 2 years. What meeting did they sit down at EA/Bioware and come to the conclusion this was a good idea? In fact, ME3 is the most pretentious game I've ever played in my life. It looks like the Titanic after the iceberg. What more needs to be said to show that this is a shameful, ""only for-profit"" game by EA and Bioware?

muzziklover,"Here we go. My most anticipated game of this year. I have been waiting for this game since Mass Effect 2 mentioned it on its loading screen. I have been playing for 25 hours. I have completed it. From my reviews of the previous Mass Effect games, I highly regard them as one of the greatest Sci-fi stories of this generation and of all time. To make it short, I am a huge fan of this Sci-fi video game series. Mass Effect 3, for the past 4 months, have consumed me with anticipation and hype and I can tell you that for the most part, it was worth it but let me remind you to put emphasis on ""the most part"". Mass Effect 3 is a great game. The gameplay is the best in the series, the scope and ambition is huge, the story is still great and the characters are still great. All that is probably the big bulk of the game. But I am hesitating to my own surprise. After completing it, I felt completely bitter sweet. It wasn't horrible but It wasn't satisfying. I have read the comments made in this site about the game's ending and how it was a complete let down. From all the the comments, I was still confident that Bioware wouldn't disappoint with the ending of a prolific 3 game trilogy. To my own dismay, the thing that completely prevented me from giving this a 9 or 10 was the ending. It wasn't bad but it gave me such an empty feeling and I didn't like it one bit, especially when I have been lovingly crafting my story ever since the beginning. It felt so abrupt and it made me feel like all my accomplishments from the previous two games and my play through of ME3 inadequate and it left a lot of questions hanging for this series. Maybe its just me. Maybe this is the ending Bioware was planning since the beginning of the game and I wanted a satisfying ending because my Shepard has been working his/her (I have two Shepards) ass off. I wasn't satisfied at all. I have read theories about the ending that made me hopeful but as of now, they're still theories, not facts. The only positive thing that I could say about it is that I have never seen an ending quite like it and doesn't follow the typical Hollywood like ending which made me respect the ambiguity of it. Other than the ending, there are other problems the game suffers from. The dialogue option is very dumbed down to my surprise. If you want a conversation with your squad made on your off time, you only get the option wheels when at certain points of the story. The option wheel is dumbed down as well as I felt there was less dialogue options than in the previous games and the quick time paragon/renegade trigger and the charm/intimidate options are very occasional. All of this makes a very linear story that gives you smaller options on what path you can choose. There are still bugs from the previous games that ME3 suffers from like the random lighting, slow texture resolutions and occasional lag. Oh and the lip-synch is quite off too. The ending is the thing that most people and fans have been complaining about and I agree but unlike most of them who gave this game a straight 0 because of the ending, I still enjoyed this game. I love the story in this game, albeit the bitter sweet ending and it can be very intense, especially when you're doing Priority missions where you gather the entire galaxy for war. The combat is fantastic and will test your strategic skills when having gun fights. The characters are still the characters I know and love from the previous games, some matured from the past 2 games. Garrus is still my loyal sidekick and best friend, Joker is actually at his funniest in this game because I was laughing at his jokes and comments all the time and Liara is still one of my favourite video game heroines. Even when the dialogue option is dumbed down, it was still fun hearing conversations from the npc's. The multiplayer is fun but Mass Effect 3 doesn't really need it and I know that Bioware intended to put multiplayer in the series since the first game. Before I end this review, I should probably mention the one day DLC. I do agree that it is steep in price and felt like a cop out. The mission was absurdly short for a DLC and the character squad mate that you get should have been in the main story but to be honest, I really like the Prothean squad mate. I think he's probably one of the best squad members I have ever recruited because he's pretty much a walking renegade on vengeance mode. Shame you have to buy him (if you bought the game in standard). Overall, this game is really good. It could've been great if not for the bitter sweet, empty pay off it gives you after all your hard work, especially if you've completed the previous games and its limited choices you can make but it's combat, characters and progressing story makes up for it. I'm glad I waited for it and I'm glad that I played it.",8,2012-03-18,XBOX 360,user

Each clue episode is as heart-touching as ever, dialogues are excellently written (for the most part), and the whole emotional impact is so huge, that i couldn't handle myself and cried several times.

But i personally play Mass Effect not for it's symbolical content, but for it's straightness with a player. It's deep connection with you and the Big Story is one of the most important parts of the series. The motivation is important. This ending has no motivation at all. It feels unfinished and frustrating. Why do we play 85+ hours of the greatest adventure in gaming history? We were given the right to choose. And it was very well made, indeed. The ending of ME3 doesn't give you a satisfaction, because there is no choice at all. Some pointless images, highly metaphorical (and profoundly disconnected with the whole series) scenes, and then... It ends. Are you really sure?.. It's supposed to be a trilogy, right? And why do i feel, that the last scenes are bad jokes? It seems for me, that the ""Epilogue"" DLC will be the right decision. Please, Bio Ware. There is nothing to be ashamed. You did a great job. But the ending confused too many of us. You may not rewrite it, but you still can correct it. I still recommend this game to everyone with a good taste and open heart and mind.

Jedah,"Mass Effect 3 is a very entertaining game that follows closely the formula of ME2, but there are several MASSIVE PROBLEMS with it. I would recommend you do NOT purchase it at this time. If you consider yourself a loyal fan of the series, and appreciated the direction of the stories in the previous games, there is an excellent chance you will find the endings deeply unsatisfying. There is currently a campaign underway to convince Bioware to add an alternative to the current endings. You can find out more by searching for Retake Mass Effect. Multiplayer is a component Bioware decided to include with this game. Normally this wouldn't be a concern for single player focused players, but a player's participation in MP has a direct effect on your SP experience, specifically the ending. Even if you are a completionist type of player who carefully goes through the game checking everything, you may not have enough of a certain score to achieve the ""best"" ending if you do not play multiplayer. For those without a reliable internet connection, this is a serious problem. The day one DLC is a sore point for many gamers. While I would not call the content ""necessary"" for full enjoyment of the game, your squad would seem fairly bare without the inclusion of the character in this dlc, and considering the free squadmate offered very soon after Mass Effect 2's release, there is no reason this couldn't have been free as well (aside from corporate greed, which is exactly what this is). Finally, a smaller complaint, but one I suspect many fans will be upset about. A certain character's true appearance is revealed in this game. If you are a long time fan you will know exactly who I speak of. Let's just say the reveal is quite disappointing, and it involves photoshop. All these issues (minus the MP) are based on my own opinions. I have been a big fan of the series since the beginning, and 99% of the trilogy has been an absolute blast. I don't expect Bioware to remove or change the offenses I have listed above, but I would sincerely appreciate an alternative. If you share my opinion on some of these missteps, I would again ask that you do not purchase the game at this time.

bup487,"Bioware managed to avoid the pitfalls of unnecessary exploration, puzzle games, and resource gathering that made the past two entries in the Mass Effect trilogy hard to play and, more importantly, replay. The inclusion of all the extra side missions took the place of the aforementioned pitfalls that nearly ruined the past two games. These side missions are frustrating when you need to look at a website to figure out where to get the correct quest item, but this solution is not nearly as bad as strip mining every known planet in the galaxy. The rising action that leads up to the final battle is intense enough to bring out many emotions during the final battle. These feelings carry on to the very end where the player has to make a final choice. To keep the player guessing, many of these choices aren't explained. You'll ask yourself what choice is best overall. It is understandable that players felt betrayed by the ending that was presented. All the choices that were to have a massive effect went off like a roman candle instead of a nuclear bomb; personally, I WAS MORE INTERESTED IN THE REAPERS AND WHY THEY WERE KILLING LIFE THAN WHETHER OR NOT MY CHOICES HAD AN IMPACT.

Voice acting is great too but he writing can be a bit cheesy. The new multiplayer mode is also surprisingly brilliant. Probably the best survival mode I've played in a game yet. That being said the game's not without it's problems. Day one DLC is never a good thing and it cut's out a very important part of the story. The fact that most controls are on the A button is kinda awkward too, I found myself taking cover or rolling over and over when trying to revive a teammate and then have them bleed out on me. The biggest problem I have with the game is the ending and I'm sure my fellow Mass Effect fans will agree. Everything story-wise up until the last 10 minutes is fantastic. But then the ending kicks in. Without spoiling it all I can say it's a confusing, plothole-filled mess that kinda just says **** you"" to all your decisions in the past games and only gives you one conclusion but with a different colour.

WWWYKI,"Arguably the best game I've ever played. The combat is better and the writing is top notch (until the end). The ending left such a bad taste in my mouth that it sort of ruined the whole franchise for me. Other problems include your character talking too much without your input and some characters from Mass Effect 2 do not receive the recognition they deserve. Still a great game, but I believe Mass Effect deserved better than what we got.",8,2012-03-17,XBOX 360,user

But it also had some of the most satisfying, unbelievable triumphs I've ever witnessed. The Rannoch mission and its multiple conclusions convinced me that ""this is the greatest game I've ever seen."" Sadly, the ending killed it- but its still ""bearable"" as long as you can accept that you get the same crappy ending regardless of your choices in the previous or current games. Hopefully DLC will include more options/ more epicness for the ending.",4,2012-03-17,XBOX 360,user
Corvallis,"I'm just shocked that players hate the endings so much that they rate this game so low !!! I mean I'm a huge fan of the series, played the first 10 times, the second 22 times, read all the books well you see what I mean. The game is a blast : the cutscenes are way better than in the second lesser bugs, a gameplay that is more playable. Mass Effect 2 without its background and everything would be a pretty **** TPS. Even the questlines are not so great I mean just going to a planet searching for a new squadmate then talk to him and he gives you a quest you do it and once you finished it you realize : well I destroyed the collectors and I fought them 3-4 times even if they are the main enemies ! The mercenaries seem to be the real ennemy in this game ! In the third well it's still not perfect less choices of missions and not many different ennemies, sure it feels it lacks something but I really enjoyed the game it is quite long (on Insanity maybe) 36h to finish everything so I think it is not short for TPS standards, we see old friends, we have a lot of weapons to choose, better armor parts than in the second, we can upgrade weapons without having to search for damn minerals in planet scannings that take hours from you don't get any satisfaction, the storyline is well driven to the end at least we understand what is happening except in the ending. I regret that the game is too action oriented sure but still the game is way better than many of the games we can see released today ! So I'm not getting too much in the details but I want to say that OK the endings are quite disappointing it is not what I expected at all for the ending but you can't think that this game is worse than DNF or less good than Modern Warfare 3 ! I don't want to troll but guys ! Realize what you're saying ! You have the right to be disappointed I totally agree with you guys but don't put a so low rating for this game just because of an ending ! I chose to rate it 10 just because some people think that because of a ending it deserves 1 or 0 ! I would put 8 or 9 I still prefer the second one but the third is a good game not a bad one at all and think that maybe a fourth game will justify the endings. Let's hope it is not a DLC. To conclude this : It is a really good game, worthy of being in the series but with an ending that is not as good than we could expect. Also the dialogues are too simple (two choices most of the time which is not much) and EA did not help to make the game better with **** as Online pass, Day One DLC, future DLC plans. The game could have used 1 more year of development because it ends a trilogy that many loved. So if the game was disappointing to you blame EA first they choose the release date and the time of work put into the game.",10,2012-03-17,XBOX 360,user

saintsofboredom,"Mass Effect 3 is a good game, but abandons many of the series's staples about half way through the game. The conversation wheel was which was a staple of the last two game is all but abandoned about half way through the game for more linear conversations. Talking to squad members on the Normandy in between missions is turn into a series of stocked conversation with no way to pick the dialog. Another staple that is lost are the Paragon and Renegade points. They are instead replaced with Reputation points which are earned despite the decisions you make. Another minor problems include a less detailed mission journal, which does not tell the how far you have progressed on your missions, but instead just give you a summary of the mission. Changes to the combat system such as weapon selection and modding are a welcome median from the two or three weapons per category in ME2 and the ridiculous over abundance of weapons and mods from ME. The weight vs. power recharge times is great way to make sure players are not over powered with weapons and unlimited fast recharging powers. The new ability to roll away make the actual combat more like Gears of War with powers, which is not a bad thing. The ending(s) does leave something to be desired, mainly an overall explanation of what is happening after you make your final choice.",7,2012-03-17,XBOX 360,user

All the choices and hours invested over the past two games (and 5 years) were promised to carry over to the final game in a summation of our actions, good and bad, leading up to this point. This promise was completely broken as the ending played out and the obvious disregard for said promise was thrown out the window. Instead, you are presented with three choices that are all entirely too similar, rife with plot holes and inconsistencies that would make the Bush administration blush. Major decisions throughout the series were ignored, leaving the player to have no real reason to agonize over the decisions in the first place.

rsimmo,"No previous video game series has previously affected me as much as the Mass Effect series. The first game set the series up and the second is my favourite ever game bringing the series forward with an epic storyline. This made the third in the series the most anticipated game ever for me and whilst playing through the story it duly delivered. The story **** you in and keeps you as enthralled if not more than the previous instalments and keeps you striving for more. However, as is mentioned all over the internet is the game's controversial end. I have to admit at first I was with the masses, angry and heartbroken that the series had done such a thing to me. However, is everything as it seems at the end? If looked at and analysed in detail the ending could be seen as incredibly clever and not just sloppy and with potential downloadable content maybe the story of mass effect is set to continue some more. The multiplayer is another new edition to the series and while it may be limited to the single mode of multiplayer it is addictive and keeps you wanting more. All in all the game is definitely one of the most memorable of all time and if rumours of an expanded ending are true it could go down as one of the best games of all time.",9,2012-03-17,XBOX 360,user
SUPERFLY,"I'm going to get straight to the point with this. It is OVER now EA / Bioware. You will get not one single penny more from me. EA / Biowares shameless and cynical manipulation of loyal gamers has gone too far. I've been with this series from the very start. Mass Effect 1 was a triumph even with its flaws. Mass Effect 2 was good, but it lacked some of the heart of the original and it was also the beginning of the money grabbing EA is notorious for. Mass Effect 3 is good, but has had almost all its heart and soul ripped away (with a few exceptions) and has finally confirmed what everyone knew, IT'S ALL ABOUT THE MONEY! There is so much I want to rant about but I'm just going to stick with one example. DAY ONE DLC. Why is this not in my game already? Why am I paying an extra Â£7 for access to this on top of the Â£40 I've already spent for the game? With the script leaks and art book leaks everyone knows that this character was part of the game. Yet still EA / Bioware deny. How stupid do they think we are? I know that I don't have to buy this content. I know that I can say ""no"". It's the manipulation and disrespect that EA shows to gamers that angers me. I would of given this game 8 out of 10 if I wasn't feeling quite so furious. I just hope that someone within EA / Bioware can put their ruthless pursuit of profit aside long enough to show some respect to customers and start making truly great, innovative, RPGs again.",5,2012-03-17,XBOX 360,user

RobertLangford,"Fans of the game (I was one) are flabbergasted the complete failure to deliver by Bioware. Gamers that, like me, followed this incredible trilogy (ME1, ME2 and ME3) got emotionally involved with the richness of the in-game characters and their interactions. All along and from the beginning of ME1, they were told by Bioware that choices that they made along the story arc would eventually have an impact on the ending. This was not the case. In the end (the last fifteen minutes or so), the main character of the game is presented with three choices, but these have practically no relationship with the rest of the game and how it was played. The impression is that Bioware decided to cut costs and rush the ending, as the three ending options are equally shoddy, with pseudo-philosophical explanations that don't make much sense. There is no resolution and the players are left with the impression that all they have done up to the end was a complete waste of time and effort. Most importantly, the players are left emotionally empty. It's a very confusing and depressing feeling let me tell you. The game could have had an epic ending with variations from the very bad (everyone dies) to the very good (everyone survives and there's a victory party) and an in-between bittersweet ending with lots of tears... But Bioware dropped the ball just before the finish line. I give this game a score of 3. These points are for the technical and artistic aspects, which are ok and good respectively. The main part of the points in my mind would have gone to the story; it gets 0 for the stupid stupid stupid endings. ME3 should have been the ultimate conclusion to the trilogy, a high point of sorts, but turns out in the end to be a dud.",3,2012-03-17,XBOX 360,user

They made a pretty interesting platform for a game, but EA/Bioware have only a good concept ****. After playing the 3rd of this trilogy I understand the concept. The problem without good closure for a concept is that unlike a book or movie I would not pay for an incomplete cinematic ending in an interactive game. The plot holes are not what a player should use to write his/her ending. As a dedicated fan I trusted the vision of the writers so much that I completed the first 2 games numerous times. Honestly they should have been shorter. How many times was I lead to believe my choices would matter? Before ME3 there was a lot of buzz from Bioware that I should believe my choices would matter.

It is the Epiosde One of videogames. It is a badly written, nonsensical mess that aims to be bittersweet, but is just infuriaritng in its slackness and rushes nature. The ending is so bad that it drags down the entire perception of the game, and to a lesser exteent the rest of the series too.

Its like they worked so hard on the game that when they got to the ending they just halfassed it, Otherwise if it werent for the ending this game woulda been the perfect 10/10 it shoulda been but fanboy or not i cant rate this game any higher. Like i said the game is Brilliant but once you beat it, you wont want to pick it up and play it again(atleast thats how I felt) And the collectors Edition just feels like a lie that i slightly regret purchasing, buts thats just me, otherwise all gripes aside, this game is EXCELLENT.

You will fall in love with this game. If you're new to the series and are thinking about playing this game, I would STRONGLY recommend playing the first two games before you play this one. Each game is about making difficult decisions shaping the future of the galaxy then carrying your decisions over into the next game in the series. So in order to get the full experience out of Mass Effect 3, then you should play the other two games first. If not, then you will be completely lost.

Zjarcher878,"I loved the Mass Effect Series. I wouldn't call myself a completely hardcore gamer but I have stepped my amount of gaming through the years and I owe that to Mass Effect. It was refreshing to see a game with a great story and good characters. Mass Effect 3 is no exception. The writing and dialogue is top notch. The voice acting is fantastic. The game story starts with a bang the simmers for a bit. But once you hit the 15-20 hour mark it really takes off. I felt like the quantity of scripted dialogue was greater than I'd like but once the story gets good you forget about it. I personally think the combat it much better. Enemies are smarter and the mechanics, while still slightly unforgiving, are much smoother than in previous iterations. The level design is top notch, with Mass Effect benefiting greatly from becoming a vertical game. The customization for your powers and weapons is brilliant. Mass Effect 3 is really a perfect blend of the first two games. What prevents this game from being a perfect 10 is the ending. The last mission is great but the aftermath of your decision is full of plot holes and doesn't make sense. When I first saw an uproar over the ending I thought it was fanboys not getting the ending they wanted and whining about it. Well I was wrong and they were right. It's not that the end was completely terrible, it is just that there is little variation between the three endings and I part that is consistent through all three (provided you have a high enough galactic readiness) comes out of nowhere and doesn't make sense. I do hope Bioware releases a DLC with an alternate ending of some sort. I was very disappointed. However, don't let the ending scare you away from what is really and awesome game and worth playing. Oh and while its stupid to have a $10 DLC, From Ashes is really worth it. Though to be fair it should of been added to the game to begin with.",9,2012-03-16,XBOX 360,user

On the gameplay front, this is a perfect game: everything you do in combat feels right, and even the recently added multiplayer is sleek as hell. For the most part, the story is just as fantastic, using five years of built tension to masterful effect. However, the ending features a mind screw of a plot twist that feels wrong given the context. In no way does the ending fulfill the expectations laid out by the prior two games or the promises of the devs, instead resembling a rejected premise from Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.

tomy90,"Spoiler free Plus points Gameplay - interesting map layouts and combat is even better than ME2 Story - Brilliantly happy, sad and awe inspiring moments throughout most of ME3 Your Story - the game crafts itself around your previous decisions and see many of those decisions play out in front of you Graphics - crisp and feels like you are in a real war rather than turf war characters - feel alive and can get attached to characters online - very much refreshing and good for occasional breaks Negatives Ending - no closure, logical explanation of ending and plot holes (probably worst ending I have ever seen) Dialogue - extremely well done when scenes appear but much more linear than ME2 experience and less often Galaxy At War - makes it impossible to get the best ending without playing online and reduces your decisions to statistics rather than emotional decisions Navigation - can be tricky with side missions that are not highlighted on the map where they are which ends up needing using online sources or guides to find out where to go. Lack of exploration - you can go across the galaxy but only one location you can visit constantly no matter what which is much less than ME1 and ME2. Overall Apart from the ending all the issues in ME3 are minor issues that can be easily forgiven because of the overall experience throughout except for the last section. If the ending of the mass effect 3 was satisfactory (not perfect but an improvement) I would most likely give ME3 9.0 or 10 but because of the ending putting a sour note on the entire series and damages replay value it is 7.0 till DLC or something comes along to remedy the issue",7,2012-03-16,XBOX 360,user

The choices presented to Shepard were nonsensical and there was merely cosmetic differences between the possible endings. What most fans expected were vastly different endings from the very bad (where the reapers win and kill all) to the very good (where Shepard and his/her crew survive and have a huge party), depending on choices made in the preceding episodes and earlier part of ME3.

Nonetheless, 3 games worth of choices and storytelling were tossed out the window in the final minutes leaving me with a severely bad impression. I don't mind the tone or the darkness. I do mind that it felt like, for the ending, a different group of writers were brought in, given a two-sentence plot summary and told that resources were limited so they should cut as many corners as possible. Up until then, I was planning on going back on playing through all three again to see the results of different paths. After I played through the 3 alternate endings thinking I must have just picked the wrong one the first time, I was so annoyed that I just uninstalled it.

Thorgunna,"I want so desperately to be able to give this game a 10 because I have been a huge fan of the series since ME1. I had never played any similar games before but after watching my husband play the first half hour of the first game I knew I needed to play it. Many years later and many playthroughs of each game later I had never been more excited for a game. This was the first game I'd ever gone to a midnight release for. I actually took off two vacation days from work so I could play it to my heart's content without that pesky work obligation getting in the way. Then the ending hit me. I played through as a renegade first so I thought it might've just been because I made some terrible decisions, but then I played as a paragon and still the same disappointing endings. Even though the endings **** (and I still hope even though I know I shouldn't get my hopes up that it will be improved with DLC) the rest of the game was fantastic. I teared up and outright cried at some moments. Some had me giggling and texting my husband so he could have a laugh (he doesn't mind spoilers and I was also partially rubbing it in that I had finished two playthroughs before he finished his first). Spending all this time with my crew, I got attached. Again, even though the ending of ME3 leaves a lot to be desired I think it's a big compliment for Bioware that they were able to create characters that we feel deserve to have a proper ending. We want to know how their lives turned out. We care about them. So congrats to Bioware for creating such a wonderful universe.

To say the ending is a disappointment is idiotic. The ending has given fans a feeling of emptiness. This suggests the ending has tweaked and emotional nerve on gamers, something which a video game rarely does. I myself as a fan will admit I would have preferred to see Shepard return to Earth and his crew mates and witness the emotional encounters between the characters as a result of galactic salvation, however this sort of a hollywood happy ending would not conclude such a groundbreaking trilogy.

Rickin10,"Oh, contrasting emotions.... I love Mass Effect, I've sunk huge chunks of my life into it, and now... I feel quite empty. First, the good. Combat is the best it's been all series, with vastly improved level design, weapons -both in terms of feel, customisation and variety. Ai is also much improved and much more aggressive, making for more mobile, frantic skirmishes than in camp-friendly ME2. Squadmate interaction and banter aboard the Normandy is wonderful and this is where the true spirit of ME is fulfilled and is the game's pinnacle. Now, the bad: It's evident from the opening scene there is much less chance to control what comes out of Shepard's mouth, and whilst some times this makes sense to improve the flow of scenes for the more banal 'Let's get going' stuff, there are far too many instances of 'your' character acting out of it. The lack of any vehicle sections limits variety; there are a lot of awkward animations, lip-syncing is terrible, and the soundtrack lacking Jack Wall is underwhelming. Still the game does give you some pretty major decisions, and all the while you feel the urgency of trying to unite and save the galaxy building to a poignant, desolate feeling as you leave the Normandy for the final time. And this is where it all goes horribly, horribly wrong. Mass Effect is a game that has dealt with a lot of major issues and themes, and overriding it all was the ability to choose, As you reach the end, you're given an insultingly idiotic run-down on why this is all happening and asked to choose one of 3 choices, which are baffling and completely at odds with everything you've done and been bought through the 3 games to believe. And end that not only offers no closure, no vision of what became of some of your beloved team-mates, whilst shoe-horning in colossal plot-holes. It essentially renders everything you've strived for and accomplished to irrelevance. As a culmination to a trilogy that offered the promise of choices carrying over and through 2 whole games, Bioware was always going to fall short of expectations. However for the most part ME3 offers a very fine ending to the series.... that is until you get to the end.",7,2012-03-16,XBOX 360,user

It was fun right there till the end, and now you're just like f*** that s***. Other than the ending my biggest complaint about this game is that they totally screwed up the ""Mission Journal"" (those of you that have played know what I'm talking about), however that can be overlooked. Other than that the only thing left to complain about is how much less dialog choices there are compared to previous games, but I can overlook that too given how good the game is other than the ending(of course). There's more things I could complain about, but after that it's just more being nit-picky than anything else. Also contrary to popular opinion the day-one DLC is not actually crucial to the game, it certainly adds to the experience, but it needs to be criticized for being overpriced more than anything else.

sympathy4saren2,"Where do I begin? As a big fan of Mass Effect, seeing this game and what it has become from the masterpiece of the original is saddening. BioWare and their EA Overlords first had day one dlc that they claimed was made after the fact but it has been emperically proven that the character is on the disk and can/could be unlocked simply by moving coding around. It was a lie. Emperically demonstrated, yet for some unknown reason the 'objective' gaming media pays it no **** fact...they have the audacity to tell us to stop complaining. More on that in a bit. When I purchase something and enter into a legal contract, i expect full content for what I paid for. First and foremost. The gameplay itself is a complete transformation into Gears of War, and as an rpg fan who does not like shooters, cause if I did I'd play them, its frustrating seeing that genre completely destroy gameplay in Mass Effect 3. Didn't that genre have enough sci-fi games? Exploration is non-existent, level design is linear and uninspired, although variety in theme setting is good. But its point A to point B, all of the time. Or hold a certain position while getting swarmed by wave after wave of enemies. Which is ok as a part of gameplay, but without open exploration to counteract and balance this it soon becomes an extreme bore. Biotics are good, particularly the sound of Singularity when it dissapates, but overall shooting non-stop at baddies is super boring. Weapon upgrades and modifications are much welcomed, yet far too simplistic to truly appeal to the vast amount of gamers who like the customization of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, a robust and epic rpg that sold amazingly well. The loot system is an absolute joke and an insult...most loot is lying right where you can see it in the middle of the floor or highlighted across the room so you'd be a moron if you couldn't find it. As a result, finding items is way too easy, yet it is surprisingly and frustratingly hard to keep track of what you got because there is zero inventory. Zero. And its ridiculous. Sure, the Normandy stores that info, but I'm only on the Normandy half the time, if that. The loot system is a complete insult to rpg vets. Technical issues abound, and while some can be overlooked as natural flaws, some are inexcusable. Face importing didn't work (or was intentionally neglected), faces vanished completely from cutscenes for the entire cutscene, and at times lip syncing was off completely. But where this game falls on its face, and this is contributed a lot to the departure of the Mass Effect IP's true writing talent, Drew Karpyshyn, was the writing. To appeal to the masses, Mass Effect's writing is dumbed down considerably, witholding player dialogue options from scenes, auto-dialogue from Commander Shepard much more prevalent, and eye-roll worthy 'dudebro' one liners that made me feel like Shepard evolved into Keeanu Reeves. The plot had some interesting aspects and there were some emotional scenes and nice touches sprinkled in that triggered emotion, but as a whole the plot is incoherent, poorly written and not enough focus or dialogue is given to the main antagonist. Too much tried to be done at once, and it made for a sloppy mess. The **** have been one of the worst pieces of literature I have ever seen, let alone in science fiction. For a video game, if you never played Mass Effect, you might like it. But for an intelligent individual who knows what Mass Effect is and knows a good ending (Mass Effect 2's ending literally being perfect), this one was wo bad that you want to grasp at anything you can in your mind to justify its drivel. It's that bad. And I understand the ****. It was horrendous. Let's not forget the lack of choices affecting anything, either. You will throughout the game wee choices you made, major ones, in previous games mean absolutely nothing as you see the canon version streamlined back in, with weak writing supporting the negation of your choice. It's a slap in the face, and a lie told by the developer. Also, none of your choices mean anything whatsoever. In the end, Mass Effect 3 was a downright bad and disappointing game, crippling the entire franchise with it because of its failure if epic proportions in the climax and writing, boring, repetitive gameplay, lack of polish and the lies told by the developer to fans everywhere. And gaming media...supply and demand is a two way street....customers can say what they want, how they want,when they want. Do an article how developers aren't entitled to customer money. 0/10 Avoid this game at all costs. Do not buy, you WILL regret it. Garaunteed.",0,2012-03-15,XBOX 360,user
KingWilke,"I love the Mass Effect series. I loved Mass Effect 3. The pacing was near genius and the story was stirring. Your interactions with your crew and others was fantastic. The gameplay was a great middle of the road between ME1 and ME2 allowing for more customization without inventory overkill. This game kept me up later then intended and took up a quick 30 plus hours of my life. As I watched characters I've grown to love appear and react to all the decisions made in my previous 80 hours of time in ME1 and 2 I thought, ""Wow, this could be the greatest epic of not only video game history, but of entertainment history."" Never before has something with this much ambition been made in games. So, why an eight? Because, without ruining anything you receive almost no closure. Because Bioware promised a ending that would utilize all I had done in the series, and it wasn't true. After finishing every Bioware game I have played I immediately have want to play again. Do things different. Play as I didn't before and experience all the differences. This time though, as the credits rolled, I set down my controller and felt betrayed. I had been promised so much and I have never been so disappointed. I heard complaints about the end before I finished and thought that it couldn't be that bad. I heard so much negative about Dragon Age 2 (another Bioware game) and I loved it. I'm on my third play in it. Not so with ME3. I have no ambition to ever play it again. The media I feel is not being fair. I have seen these same websites and magazines kill a games score based on the ending. Not so this time. The reviews were glowing, calling ME3 a perfect conclusion. Really? Who remembers when at the end of star wars Luke was being electrified and Darth Vader walked towards the emperor and the scene suddenly changed to Leia and Han on Dagobah swimming in a swamp and then went to black? No one? Cause that's how the end of ME3 felt. You were led on this amazing journey. You reach the end only to know that the journey was BS. It felt like being cheated on by a significant other. It felt like betrayal. Is the game a good game? Yes, very much so. The gameplay, multiplayer, and 99% of the story are amazing. That 1% that isn't?

aadms,"This Game needs a couple of lable warnings MULTIPLAYER AND PURCHASED DLC REQUIRED FOR THIS GAME. The final chapter of a very endearing series, to me, left me mostly disappointed. There is no transition in the beginning of the game from ME2 to ME3. You are given a huge plot hole to start the game that took me about ten hours worth of game playing to move on and get over it. The graphics are the same except that it has a much darker look closer to the original ME1. . The weapon's inventory system is mostly about giving you different benefits and not so much on upgrades. Just like ME2, you can only add upgrades to Shepard's armor and it is also all about having different benefits. The rest of the game plays out like what you expect from Mass Effect; get missions, blast away enemy, have some engaging cutscenes for the conclusions. Combat is definitley better. It finally ranks up there with the other top third person shooters. As far as story goes, Bioware still shows why they make the best ""interactive cinematic experiences with a more intricate storyline backed up by great voice acting. But in this game, interactive takes a back seat to watching more cinematic cutscenes. The Love Interests don't make an emotional connection in any meaningful way. And the ending? There isn't any that will revel to you your final decision. I feel for the other fans to have to end the series like this. For me, it was disappointing.",4,2012-03-15,XBOX 360,user

EngineExe,"Seriously, I know a lot of you are trying to prove a point on how disappointed you were with the ending, but 1's and 0's? Do you have any idea of how bad and broken a game would have to be to rightfully deserve a 1 or 0 score? You're just being childish. The game play mechanics are exactly what you would expect after 1 and 2, which is fine. The playtime length is just as long if not a bit longer than 2. Voice acting was great (at least with the main characters) and the overall story was superb excluding the ending. Graphics were alright other than some texture pop ups, but that's do to the 360 hardware being outdated. My year old laptop has way better specs than the 360. The multiplayer is enjoyable, nothing truly groundbreaking other than that your progress reflects in the singleplayer. I don't think I've seen a game do that before so that's pretty cool. So that's most of the good, on to the bad. I played 1 and 2 on pc so couldn't import my game. I thought by picking Kaidan and not choosing ""Numerous"" in the Deaths option I'd be fine. But no, even when I chose just Kaidan most of my team was dead already. Wrex, Jack, Grunt, Thane, Samara, Legion, and Zaeed... all dead presumably, or at least nowhere to be seen in the default none import campaign. A few bugs here and there in conversations, also finished a couple sidemissions that didn't register complete so I had to do them a second time. Now to the ending, what all these 0 scoring trolls are whining about. A big problem for me is there wasn't a final boss battle. In the last mission you kinda just fight your way through hordes of normal enemies 'til you get to the final area and cut scenes. For it being the last mission of the game, finishing it didn't really feel like much of an accomplishment. Then you get to the end and the whole Reaper situation is explained to you. I actually thought that part was pretty great. The problem though is after that you get to make one of 3 decisions and no matter which one you choose they are the same ending cinematic with slight tweaks depending on what you chose to do. Don't believe me, check youtube for the endings. Shepard does 1 of 3 actions and then it's all the same cutscene after that unless you picked destroy, then you get a few extra seconds which are not really exciting. The lack of drastic differences in the endings just makes it seem like BioWare got lazy or ran out of ideas. In either case it makes the game feel like none of the decisions I made really had any impact on the outcome of the story, which is defiantly a letdown. That being said it was the last 3 minutes **** that I had previously spent around 26-27 hours enjoying. Disappointing but not game breaking. Then there was the part after the credits. I don't even know why this was included. Maybe it was meant to be a twist, but it came across as cheesy and kind of stupid. Anyways, it was a good game. The ending was pretty lacking but I still enjoyed playing it. Worth a zero? I think not. Grow up and get over yourself.",7,2012-03-15,XBOX 360,user
BlazinBlaise,"I have been a fan of the series from the start, and running through the previous two games at least three times in for all of the achievements really allowed me to develope a relationship with many of the characters throughout the series. It is for this reason that I am fully able to appreciate the third game in the series. Many reviewers are correct when they say that this game is too busy tying up loose ends instead of introducing its own. This is due to the fact that this is meant to be the last game in the series, and does not seem to be a game that you can play without experiencing the other two. there's just too much backstory and lore to do that. I admire the third-person shooting in the game, as well as the introduction to customizable weapons. There are a few hiccups while trying to get on and move from cover to cover, but the small mistakes are easily overlooked due to the impressive story-telling, amazing environments, and even the ever-present background music. I found myself smiling at jokes among the characters, and feeling somewhat depressed when things didn't turn out the way that I wanted them too.

I still don't think we're at the stage in gaming and technology where developers are able to COMPLETELY make sure everyone gets something different, plus it's a trilogy. I can understand if it's one game, but making 3 games that would take into accounts hundreds of actions to create a unique story for millions of gamers, I think, is still out of our reach. Sure the ending wasn't as spectacular as I would've liked but it closed the game and brought an ending to the amazing story known as Mass Effect. There were still some plotholes but forgivable considering how much I enjoyed the game and the beauty and inspiring moments presented. Apparently hundreds of gamers need to get their heads out of their asses and realize that even though gaming is far more advanced than it was not even a decade ago, developers still have a lot of limitations.

The sense of control over your character's actions, and the consequences of your decisions are for naught. In the end, nothing you have done matters. If you are new to the series, flip a coin for every choice; they are meaningless. Once I was an ardent Bioware supporter, no longer.

UnSkilledCheck,"having completed this game in about 5 days i found it was a great way to end the trilogy and send it out with a bang. people complain about the three endings but its really a good idea for each sort of possibility is suited for each different types of players. having one ending that is decided for you would be a bad idea as you could play through it 5 times and each time get the same ending because you did the sames things every time. it brings back old characters and doesn't kill them off like the second game, it shows all of us what the galaxy has come to on the brink **** war. the day one dlc is a good edition to the overall game and if you don't download it you don't miss much as its only one mission. the multiplayer is a welcome edition but some people might not play it until they have finished the story and seeing as it can give you a better ending this might make people angry, but its still fun to play with some friends and beat on the reapers, geth and cerberus overall this game is a 9 for me and seeing as have played all three of them now believe this is a gaming trilogy for the ages",9,2012-03-14,XBOX 360,user
Deklan_Caine,"WARNING: SPOILER ALERT! As a prelude, let me just say that I'm a writer, and I make my living writing. I've been a writer since long before Mass Effect came out, and that's a huge part of what drew me to these games. What I loved about the ME series was how masterfully the story was woven in such a way that the authors (Bioware) crafted a tale that actually permitted input from the readers (gamers) to determine how the story progressed. No matter what path you chose, the story was interesting and engaging, but your decisions always had clear consequences in the end, as the decisions of any protagonist should. Coming into ME3, I was a little nervous. After all, with the bar being set so high with the other two, could Bioware really deliver a fitting conclusion? I mentally prepared myself for the worst. But then, as I played through the game, my fears were gradually alleviated. Frankly, the experience was Epic with a capital E. I saw how the decisions my character had made in the previous games impacted the galaxy around him. The characters came to life and drew pure emotional responses from me as the plot continued to weave itself together. But the arc of the story was clear: Shepard was not going to survive. I was okay with that, and I was ready for that. And playing through the final mission on Earth, having final conversations with all of Shep's squadmates, the writer in me was satisfied. All the loose ends seemed to be tied up. The ending was in sight, it was just a matter of seeing what exactly would happen. I'll spare you the details, but in the last 5 minutes of what had essentially been a hundred hours (or more) of story, that story was destroyed. The sad thing is that the story all made sense, it all fit, except for that last 5 minutes. From the perspective of a player, I failed to accomplish my mission. To quote Ecclesiastes, it was all vanity and grasping after the wind. From a writer's perspective, it's like I crafted a beautifully written and engaging trilogy of novels, but made someone else who didn't know the story or care about the characters write the last paragraph of the last book. As I played through the game, I kept thinking: ""This is how video games should be."" Now, seeing the end, all I can ponder is what could have been. It was so close to being perfect! But it all unraveled in 5 minutes, FIVE minutes! I didn't want a ""happy"" ending where Shep lives and has kids and blah-blah-blah (although the option would have been nice, admittedly), I just wanted an ending that kept in step with the series and made sense to a reasonable person. But none of the ""endings"" meet those criteria. It's just that simple, and just that disappointing. The endings as they are, if accepted in a straightforward manner, are so nonsensical that anything, even a hallucination or even the Reapers winning, would be more fitting. At the very least I hope Bioware will own up to how mercileslly they butchered the end of such a great story. The optimist in me dares to hope that they actually do something about it; it would not be the first time a game was significantly changed with a patch, or that a game's ending was changed with a DLC pack. No one is going to forget the feeling of being betrayed by the end of ME3, but it would go a long way towards healing those wounds if Bioware would try to make things right somehow. As a writer, I understand the argument that the creator of a story has the right to determine the ending as they see fit. And I think it's valid. But even in the realm of printed fiction, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle ""changed his story"" and brought back Sherlock Holmes after the public outcry at the character's death. Even in the realm of literature, there's room for an author here and there to admit they were wrong and change their tune. I earnestly hope Bioware decides to do the same.",2,2012-03-14,XBOX 360,user

SupR_G,"This game starts out well but finishes terribly. I didn't think it was possible for a story to have such powerful momentum and crash miserably into a wall. Aside from that, the game has some serious bug issues. I played ME2 on day 1 and never encountered anything quite as awful as the bugs in this game. On top of that, the side missions are a joke and I think are there just to distract you for a few minutes at a time, essentially forcing you to stick to the main story. This wouldn't have been so terrible, if the main story didn't end so terribly and lose all credibility.",4,2012-03-14,XBOX 360,user
timn17,"(SPOILERS, MAJOR) Seriously, don't listen to all the whiners. Yes, they made some changes, and yes, it is not Mass Effect 1, but then again, why would you want it to be? Overall, it's an amazing game, and I think the main reason it has such a low user score, especially when compared to the critic score, is that all these cry babies just couldn't stand to see their shep get killed off (unless you get the ""special ending."") It was always supposed to be a trilogy people, and I personally think the ending was amazing. Sacrificing yourself so that the universe can survive in peace? What's more heroic than that? The series was always gonna have a bittersweet ending and if you couldn't see it coming you are a failure. The only problem I have with this game is that it seems like many of your dialogue choices have been removed and turned into cut scenes, likely a result of their attempt to ""streamline"" the game for the mouth breathers who can't finish a game unless it holds their hand all the way through. and yes, some of the ""emotional moments"" were hamfisted, but some were extremely well done. Also, to everyone crying foul about how greedy ea and bioware have been with this game, I will concede that the day 1 dlc was obnoxious, and that I too could not figure out how to get my ems above 3500 without multiplayer. Pretty annoying, but at the same time, they had the balls to actually kill off their main character and, unless they plan on a ridiculous retcon, they killed their series (at least with shep as the main character.) If they were that greedy, don't you think we'd have gotten some stupidly unrealistic fairly tale ending that everyone seems to want? I know I didn't review the game, but I figure people reading here aren't looking for reviews, they are looking for complaints, and I wanted to tell you that most everyone is probably just sad about the ending and think that sad ending equals bad game, which it does not. 9 or maybe even 10 out of 10 for me.",9,2012-03-14,XBOX 360,user

GhostKnife72,"Overall a very solid game. I have been a fan/player since ME1 and ME2. Played through both at least 5 times. Already on new game + for ME3. Game play is good, not great, but just as good as ME2. Weapons, classes, squad-mates are good. Wish I could have a few more of the old favorites (I won't mention for people who didn't get to certain spots in the game yet). In effect, very close visually to ME2 (bit better IMHO) and same goes for game play. Enemies are challenging and different. There are some surprising outcomes and you don't always get to be the ""good guy (Paragon)"" if you want to get the best outcome. I'm a little annoyed about the Effect Combat Readiness stuck at 50% without extra play (MP, some iOS game, etc.) I think I did almost everything and the best I could get was around 3800. I also bought the guide too (highly recommend or at least the online IGN or Wiki). Endings I've seen so far are a bit weak for the series. I thought they would put more into it. But I have a feeling this isn't the end of ME (or even Shepard perhaps). Maybe EA pushed BioWare to setup for a fourth in the series. Who knows. Definitely has re-playability, so I recommend a buy vs. rent. Also with a buy you get 2 day gold pass for MP (if you don't have an Xbox live account). First DLC is good too, but really should have been included in the main game.",7,2012-03-14,XBOX 360,user

Okay, I haven't reached the end, so I can't comment on that. But what I can say is that even if I didn't make it to the end, I could stop now and walk away smiling. Mass Effect 3 is a great GAME. It's not the best piece of literature out there, it's not the perfect game by any means, and I'm fully expecting the ending to be a little lame. Because you know what? Compared to the meat of each of the first two, their endings weren't exactly spectacular. Mass Effect 3 in no way deserves a 0, or a 1, or even a 5. The gameplay is great, the emotion is great, the storytelling is great, the... You get the idea. If you liked the first two, play this game. If the ending winds up being off, who cares? You'll still have a great 50+ hours of fun before then. (Note: I actually wouldn't recommend this to someone who hasn't played the first two. There is a lot of backplot that wouldn't be nearly fullfilling [read: not at all] if you are coming in cold turkey.) 9 b/c I can't give is 9.5, and there are definite flaws and bugs. P.S. I don't know what people are on when they are saying their previous choices don't matter. Even if they ""don't"" matter, there is certainly a great illusion that they do.

Kokkeli,"Like many of the people here, I've been a fan of the series since day one. I fell in love with the awesome storyline, the vast amount of decisions and the immense depth in the characters. When I heard that you can import your character to Mass Effect 2 and 3 I nearly climaxed. But about the third installment, I loved nearly the entirety of it. I don't find the ""3 shots to a weak spot to kill a reaper"" thingy at all distubing. The codex (read it, 0 voters?) said that there are different classes of reapers, and the one on Rannoch was obviously a lesser one. I don't get all this ""dead squad members coming back to life"" - hassle. In my first game (I was young and foolish) Wrex died, and remained dead in the third. Clearly some players experience bugs, corrupted savegames or just a deep hatred for everything EA that they have to complain about everything. The reason I give this game a 7, and not the 9 it would deserve is for the ending. Seriously, Bioware? I loved the feeling of the whole galaxy having one common enemy, and everything in me longed for the moment we blow the reapers sky high, only to learn that in the end the reapers weren't necessarily evil. Why, oh why Bioware did you have to confuse the player at the very last moments? The ending was a steaming pile of excrement. Not at all ""a worthy conclusion to Shepard's tale"" as some claim. A cheap Deus Ex ripoff, without any information on what happened to the crew you spent HOURS AND HOURS to get to know.

vanash84,"Of all the games I have played, individual or continual, Mass Effect tops them all. And though know there is plenty of criticism with Mass Effect 3, I found none to speak of myself. Although the previous lead writer departed, the story (to me) remained in tact. It may have left most wondering in the end what happened. But I was content. BioWare gave me exactly what I wanted. An end to an amazing trilogy. I started 2 years after the release of Mass Effect [1]. But I continued my journey throughout. Laughed, fought, sat on the edge of my seat in wonder. Mass Effect 2, I saw my decisions (most of them, anyway) carry over. Felt like I was part of something big. Then, Mass Effect 3. The laughter and joy continued. As did the hurt, the worry. Even the sadness appeared. Can honestly say I have never cried during anything. Movies, TV. Nothing. The Mass Effect Trilogy became personal to me in the sense that these are all my decisions spanning 3 whole games. And to see it come to an end, felt good.

Scottface,"Okay, there are lots of malicious user-reviews on here, and although I do NOT condone them, I totally understand where they're coming from. After 3 games of making difficult choices, the end reveals that it was all for nothing. Nothing you did really makes any difference to the final outcome, and a lot is left unexplained. However, I've read user-reviews on here that have said they loved the game up until the final few minutes and rated it a 1/10. This is the most peevish example of score-trolling I've seen since the last CoD. The truth is, aside from the story's shortcomings, this is still an excellent game. The shooting mechanics are better than ever and the gameplay excells because of it. The dialogue is excellent and the voice acting is, for the most part, nop-notch. It has its gameplay flaws, too, but they're few and far-between. Having the A button (or X button on PS3) responsible for dash, roll AND a context-sensetive action button is very problematic. It's always been a problem when games like Gears and Uncharted use the same button for dash and roll, but having it as an action-button as well is just too much. Often Shepherd does the wrong thing. Also there are some stupid design choices. Example: towards the end of the game, you have to fight your way out of a hangar. Once you've defeated all enemies, you're prompted to ""escape the hangar."" Usually in the game, clicking the right analogue stick will display a waypoint showing you where to go. But in this instance, clicking the stick simply reveals the prompt again, ""escape the hangar."" Now, the hangar is 2 floors, with doors and controll panels on both floors, so you're left to check every single door and console in the entire hangar to try and escape. There's also a sense of urgency at this point in the story, which is severely undermined while you run around the hangar trying to figure out where you're supposed to go. These are fairly minor frustrations and as I said before, they're quite rare. But they do occur, and they make the game feel sloppy when they do. It's also a problem when the rest of the game feels so polished and looks so good, then you run into a stupid design decision like this and it feels 10 times worse in contrast. For most games these would feel like minor flaws but for a game with the budget of Mass Effect, they just feel a little lazy. In conclusion, this really is a good game bar a few minor flaws, and one major flaw. The major flaw is, of course, the end of the story. A huge majority of the series' fans feel letdown by this abysmal ending, myself included. Usually I wouldn't let a weak story tarnish my opinion **** too much. But Mass Effect is, and always has been, a story-driven series. The stories in the first 2 games were captivating, here it feels pretty average. Then the ending comes and is far below average. If it weren't for this ending, I'd have given the game at least a 9. If it had a truly great, satisfying ending, I'd probably even have given it a 10, despite its few gameplay flaws. As it stands though, I've had to lower my opinion of this game to an 8. Disapointing.",8,2012-03-13,XBOX 360,user
Nikola8,"I was a fan of the first game, I fell in love with the second game, and was hoping not to be let down in the third game. Not only wasn't I let down, I found one of the most satisfactory concluding acts to a video game trilogy that I've ever seen. I have played through the first two games (full playthroughs) about a dozen times. I have read every bit of lore (all the books and all the comic books). Bioware has said that, if you take a ME1/ME2 character import file, you are literally importing over a thousand choice variables into the game. Therefore, from the very beginning, you have a unique experience that is tailored to you. The graphics and gameplay are the best of the series. There is a little bit of choppy-ness in some of the cut scenes, but this is forgivable due to the excellent presentation otherwise. The game's story does seem to rely a lot on prior knowledge- Bioware has said that those who start playing ME3 without an import file will have those ""prior knowledge"" references removed, but I haven't completed a playthrough without an imported character, so I can't personally verify that. There is a lot of controversy with the ending. I will not have spoilers of what happens, but I will say that the ending is left wide open; the game instead ties up a lot of the game's loose ends throughout rather than right at the finale. I personally found the ending to be quite satisfactory- you basically take what you want from it, everything isn't happily spelled out for you. Overall, this game shines on so many levels. It took me about 30 hrs to finish a very completionist playthrough of the game. Therefore, whatever your feelings of the final 10 minutes are, they don't overshadow the other 29 hours and 50 minutes of undisputed brilliance. If you play this game with an open mind and take the time to engage yourself with the characters throughout, you will find that the ending is quite satisfactory. The ending doesn't lend closure, but there is plenty of time throughout the game to get that closure before the ending.",10,2012-03-13,XBOX 360,user

Havok1496,"Mass Effect 3 is an amazing game if you were interested in the first or the second games or even if you have never played mass effect it is definitely worth buying this game. As for the people who say your choices don't matter they do, bioware has merely made the choices harder, and the consequences as well. Where as in the first two games deaths were minor, based on yours actions companions may die however, i feel that while it is at times shocking after you let it settle in it is something to be appreciated. As for those who say the graphics are terrible that is a lie, the game looks amazing probably better than most games that are out on the xbox360, the gameplay is solid i would say that the shooting mechanics have improved, and that from the occasional cover problem combat is very easy to get into but if you play the game on the harder difficulties such as insane the game is a challenge. For those who complain about the dlc or the ending judge the entire game not just one part, if you feel bioware has wronged you. Now some of you may disagree with my rating but i will say this there is no way mass effect 3 deserves anything less than a 8. In all i recommend mass effect 3 for anybody, it is a great game, the endings for some may be not what they expected but it is an amazing game full of incredible moments that should not be missed.",10,2012-03-13,XBOX 360,user

The story is extremely well written and to all those who don't understand the ending, Look it up or something. The graphics have improved too. The game also goes back to more RPG-like roots which make it even better. ME2 was great, ME3 is excellent. The game does have a few glitches like character imports or cutscenes, but are easily overlooked and nowhere near as bad as certain RPGs that came out last year cough*cough*Sky cough*cough*rim cough*cough* The glitches are so minuscule that they won't even make me lower the game a score. This game is so close to perfection, it is ridiculous. If you are a fan of the series, this is a must buy, if not, now's the time to start.

WinterShrinkage,"As a fan of the series, this game has exceeded expectations for a final series. This space opera has finally come to the conclusion that I saw it deserved. Though there are some problems with the game, they are minor and shouldn't impede upon game play at all. From a reviewing standpoint, this game is near the pinnacle of success. Graphics - This game is gorgeous. The scale of the game, the shading, the expansive backdrops of the environments; all of it is beautiful. The only problem I saw during my 30 or so hour first play through was that some of the lip syncing and looking close enough at some areas, the geometry seems to show. Gameplay - The third person shooter and the role playing have finally meet and had their love child. I will not understand some of my friends saying that the ""rpgness"" of the game is actually lacking when it has always been there. It is a role playing game in which you are immersed as the Commander Sheperd. The gunplay is still spot on. The unnecessary amount of weapons in the first one and the lack of weapons in the 2nd one have finally mixed into a rich amount of weapons that can change the way you play to your liking. Story - The prologue of the game, for me at least, seemed to drag on a bit longer than it should have. The game goes for around two hours before we are allowed to explore the expansive galaxy. The story picks up in Act 2 which is where the majority of game play is. Now the Mass Effect series has been able to have always an engaging Act 3 but this one truly is spectacular. It feels as if you are fighting a losing and desperate struggle between the Reapers and the rest of the galaxy. I shall say it here, I enjoyed this game thoroughly for all the cameos of characters and such from my paragon play through. Im hoping the Renegade playthrough plays completely differently because of my decisions from mass effect 2, mainly the ending...hint hint. This game delivers what was expected. From a game developing standpoint, it has very few glitches and problems and is very cleanly ""cut."" My only concern with this game is that it doesnt feel like a third game in the Mass Effect series. It feels like a sequel to the 2nd game. This would be fine because it feels as if it is a design that the developers had thought out. The max level in the first one was 60 if I recall correctly and the max level in the 2nd one was 30; if you import your character from Mass Effect 2, you can potentially start at level 30/60. This seems like reasonable progression but it feels as if the game could potentially have been a Mass Effect 2.5; withholding the story. My final verdict for this game is that as a solo effort it is very well done, but as a ending to a trilogy, it feels incomplete. Though what I say is contradictory, I can't see a better final game to the trilogy, I'm ""bummed"" it didn't end better for the series. I can't believe this series is over though. Must be nice... 8.75/10",9,2012-03-13,XBOX 360,user
Glogglies,"It's a polarizing finale to what some gamers consider one of the best franchises in videogaming. For me, Mass Effect 3 was a fantastic journey, well told, nicely fleshed out, and incredibly beautiful (at times); but the main issue in this game comes with it's final scenes, and that's where the replayability of the game can really be weakened. This game has some gripping scenes, some will even have you in tears if you're one for sappy scenes. There are a number of moments that really heavily on your knowledge of previous games, in order to pull at your heart strings, but I think any gamer coming into this will appreciate the way a lot of the scenes are choreographed and written. Another noteworthy point is the voice acting, which is very well done (aside from the protagonist, unusually). Biowares signature morality and choice system returns here, but it feels really old and outdated. Heres the gist of it, pick the top choice you're being the nice guy, pick the bottom choice you're being the bad guy. There's little room to really give the player real choice, it all really boils down to if you want to be bad or good. I was impressed with the graphics here, but the CGI cutscenes seemed a notch down in graphical quality than the actual gameplay, which was incredibly distracting. And the character animations, face models, character pop ins etc will be immediately noticeable to anyone playing the game. It's pretty bad. But somehow, despite my gripes, I had a hell of a ride with this game. The final hours of the game are incredibly suspenseful, and there are moments where this game is down right brilliant. Steer clear of the multiplayer in this one, forgive the sometimes laughable animations, and try to hold of on beating the game for as long as possible. This one's not devoid of flaws, but any player who wants to call it a disaster is just kidding themselves.",8,2012-03-13,XBOX 360,user

I don't remember any game that the community ever hated that much only because it had a bad ending.

The story telling was good in this game the same as it was in all the others. Until the ending. *spoilers* Once i reached the ending i was given 3 options. All pretty much the same. No matter what combination of War Assets achieved. You could beat this game with 0 War assets and have the same ending I did. Also, the choices I made were not reflected at all. Which was Biowares big deal for this series. I am severally disappointed. On the good side. Combat was amazing the best its been in any of the other games.

zurupeto,"This game was so not what I wanted Mass Effect 3 to be that I was actually shedding tears of frustration by the end of it. As the story unfolded, I lost control of the Shepard I'd spent hours and hours creating through the first two games as he continually did and said things my Shepard would never have done, without any input from me. The narrative has a couple of really good highlights, but is weak on the whole, and the available endings are not only dissatisfying, but in many ways nonsensical. The visual and sound design are strong, but aren't enough to carry the rest. Were it not the conclusion to one of the most promising video game franchises of all time, I'd say this game was simply unremarkable. But it is, and it's beyond disappointing, offering me nothing of what I loved from ME1 but lip service. Mass Effect 3 will be remembered in infamy, if at all, and it's release definitely heralds a truth I've been fearing: the death of the Bioware I'd relied on for exceptional games.",3,2012-03-13,XBOX 360,user
nengracio,"All forms of narrative storytelling (whether it be books, movies, or video games) are judged on the beginning of the narrative and the conclusion of it. With that being said, Mass Effect 3 is a great game until you reach the lackluster ending. When a company such as Bioware creates a game that takes pride in its extraordinary writing, issues with the story are huge because we, the consumers, expect the best from Bioware. This awful set of ending scenarios is probably another money milking tactic of EA's in order to squeeze more money out of the Mass Effect IP, whether it be in the form of DLC or future sequels (Bioware has already stated that even though Shepard's story is over, the Mass Effect IP may continue in the future). It's entirely possible that this series of ending scenarios was made in order to make the writing process for the next trilogy of ME easier, which I hope was the case because apparently they downgraded in that regard. Mass Effect 3 is rather enjoyable except for the last 30 minutes, with that being said, if you prefer to play video games with strong narratives, this game isn't for you. The ending has many plot holes which are not explained and any questions that were to be answered from previous installments were just replaced with new ones (most likely to garner interest in future titles). One last note; there are a lot of reviewers here who believe that those who are giving low scores are ignorant or that it's merely a bunch of ""trolls"". The truth is that this franchise was harmed in the worst way when these terrible endings were implemented. The truth is that for most of the negative reviews (not all of them, but most) there is a player who was expecting an epic conclusion to an epic saga, but was left with a deep feeling of betrayal and disappointment due to a tragic ending **** trilogy (I do not mind sad endings, by tragic ending I mean an ending of poor taste). I'm not sure if I'm going to buy ME4 (I definitely will not buy it on its day of release, so I can wait to see the reviews before purchasing it) but if they do plan to continue the franchise, I hope they carry it out in a careful manner and return to the roots that made Mass Effect 1 such a great video game. I'm sure those who are loyal to the franchise will agree with me.",2,2012-03-13,XBOX 360,user

Pops64,Don't listen to all the bad user reviews that are about this game. Yes there are few bad things that prevent it from being 10 out of 10. But it was still an EPIC game. Only bad thing was it was to much FPS and not enough RPG but that's what happens when you try to appeal the masses. A few other thoughts: The mulitplayer is completely optional. I played all the way through on single player including side quest and never noticed any side effect of never going online. Be careful when you are doing the main story line. There is one quest that gets ride of a couple non important side quest and one kinda of important side quest with out telling you that this will happen.,9,2012-03-13,XBOX 360,user
Diogo_Silva,"Let me just start by saying that Mass Effect 3 is one of the best games I've ever played until more and less 20 min before the end. Unlike the criticism that your ME1 and ME2 choices didn't matter much in ME3, I think that BioWare made a terrific effort in taking into account all your choices and delivering you some rather unexpected consequences for them (save for some minor plot gaps, i.e., I romanced Liara in ME1 and again in ME2 in the Shadow Broker DLC, but when I reunite with her in ME3 she says that we haven't been together in years. wtf?). Again, this applies only if you exclude those last 20 minutes. For those who have been following the series since ME1, the game is an emotional roller coaster that delivers several truly memorable moments (sad, hopeful and hilarious) in a way that truly represents the unique spirit of the series. In fact, there are several missions in which I felt that my previous actions actually mattered for the story (e.g., curing/sabotaging the genophage, the krogan-turian aliance, the war between the geth and quarians, etc). But then again, all of this only applies before those last 20 min. After this moment, its a freakin downhill ride in plot quality. Even though I seem to felt that my actions would actually have big consequences, the end boils down to a deus ex machina plot device, delivering three options none of which my Shepard would take. What's more, these three options are regardless of any previous choices that I've made and their outcome is nearly the same but with different colors (oh, and there is a variation where earth is destroyed and not saved). The ending also does not deliver a single bit of closure to the Shepard's story. If these endings are supposed to be very open so that ""our imagination can complete the rest"", I wouldn't need to play the whole damn game in the first place! I could have just imagine how it would end from ME2! If I'm playing a trilogy until the end, I would expect (at least!) to know what the hell happened, because I sure did not understand what happened next. In the supposed perfect ending, Shepard seems to survive a massive explosion of the citadel (as shown by a 10sec footage of him coffing in a pile of rubble) but how?! And how did my teammates made it to the normandy in time (seemingly in perfect condition when they get out to the tropical planet) and why is joker fleeing at full speed from the ""blast wave"" from the mass relays? In the Arrival DLC, we are told that the destruction of a mass relay would wipe out the entire system it orbits, which means that earth was also wiped out by the mass relay in the Sol system?! But apparently the soldiers on earth seem to survive... A so joker is running from...? what? Whether you control or destroy the reapers or you chose synthesis, the outcome of those choices is exactly the same for me, because we get to know so little about what happens in the future! And don't tell me it is supposed to be THAT open, unless BioWare is thinking of making a new game that resumes from those disparate resolutions in three whole new different ways, which is unlikely. I loved the game until that final mission, where I just stared at the TV trying to digest such a bad plot ending and getting absolutely no satisfaction at all. I usually finish ME games twice (paragorn and renegade), but ME3 is so emotionally taxing in the end and leaves such a depressing feeling, that I am not sure that I'll be able to go through that again. And all they had to do was a decent ending. Not one where Shepard would invariably live, but at least one where players could understand what the hell just happened!",0,2012-03-13,XBOX 360,user

ColdHardTruth,"Mass Effect 3 is the final chapter in this thrilling and epic franchise created by Bioware. Let me start off saying this has been a pleasure to play all through all 3 games. Mass effect has gone through changes from 1 to 3 for the better (examples: shooting mechanics, graphics, character management). With movie like productions Bioware did an excellent job from creating relationships with all characters involved and the decision you need to make to building a huge universe to explore and navigate through. Mass effect 3 succeeds the expectations by a long shot. With an epic story of a race against time to gather help from all edges of the universe to save Earth and other home worlds before the reapers destroy every living being. Simply put it has the drama and action you crave from the last 2 to keep you happy for a while. This one gets a 9.5/10 from me.

My ownly gripe i have with is the the ending but not because of what others have listed.

I understand a LOT of people will be frustrated with Mass Effect 3 an its shoddy delivery but lets grow up a bit shall we? As I said the gameplay as always been basic and functional at best, and Mass Effect 3 deliveries the best game play experience of the trilogy. Its still not brilliant, but it is better. Plot wise I will agree that the ended is quite ham fisted, and liberties have been taken with continuity for the sake of accessibility.

Most notably the Geth/Quarian war, (if you weren't able to save both then your simply a heartless bastard). I'm going to enjoy talking to people about the choices they'd made and how it'd played out for them. I'm not really sure what people are saying when it comes to all your choices come to naught in the end. 70% of this game is watching your choices play out. Sure eventually the consequences boil down to a score about your fleet, but I by the end all the major plots have been satisfactorily laid to rest. This leads me to conclude that all these negative reviews are being written by whiny, entitled people who are terrible at having realistic expectations. I'm sure there are people out there who could have written a better ending in there heads.

wejx89,"The game gives us the best story, the voice acting gives you tears as the characters come to life. Yes, many including me didn't really like the ending but even then the game ends leaving everything open and closing the chapter on Shepard's story. It is up to the individual to make what he wants from it and that is true art. To leave things so open and yet finishing it all is hard and few actually can do this. The problem Bioware did was that they made the best game possible and some thought the deserved to have the ending fit them. The story gives us Shepard who is on Earth when the Reapers attack. He/she must flee and unite the known Galaxy against this threat or else all will be lost. The soundtrack is perfect and make you want to cry or yell in some parts from sheer joy or sadness. The characters especially Tali'Zorah vas Normandy and Garrus Vakarian feel more alive then any characters in any game and in almost any movie, the game is that good. The graphics have been fine-tuned and are truly beautiful, the fact that eyefinity now works is also an added Bonus. The combat is smoother then ever before and is now a true cover to cover shooter like Gears of war in terms of combat. The romances are wonderful, I let a few tears drop as my Shepards love interest in the final battle said ""I want more time"" in a tone of desperation, sorrow and love that I couldn't take. The emotional investment the gamer forms is truly marvelous. The game gives the player an almost outrageous amount of free will in many aspects like combat, exploration and story which is typical for Mass Effect and gives players an even greater feeling of immersion. The fact that you can load your save files from the previous games is superb as your individual story continues which the choice from every quest and conversation following you to the next game. If you like a truly good sci-fi adventure, if you like to have real characters threat travel with you, characters that almost feel alive, if you want all that then start playing Mass Effect and buy the next two games when you finish. This is in my opinion the best game series in the world and the only faults I was able to find in this game was that you have to be emotionally prepared for this game as it really touches your heart in ways you couldn't possibly expect. the other fault is that this is the end of Shepard's saga and I will never again be play him or romance Tali'Zorah and save the galaxy with her along side Garrus Vakarian the best turian there is.",10,2012-03-13,XBOX 360,user

I honestly thought the game was fantastic throughout, and although i wasn't completely satisfied with the ending, i thought it was a very interesting and unique way to end the series. If that's what they were still planning on doing with this game. that being said, im still not sure which one i like the most out of the series. while the last game was great, this one has so much more life to it. the characters, your squadmates, they feel real to interact with. i remember in the last game, each one would simply stay in their designated areas, not moving, and only talking to you when you engaged in a conversation. now they all do there own thing. they interact with the other characters and there environment even while your not around. they even leave the ship with you when you go to the citidel to explore it for themselves. this also carrys over into combat as well, infact combat is so much more improved than the last game, it makes the last two feel sad in comparison. you can now perform many new maneuvers, and the cover system is greatly improved. the enemies are also much smarter and will now even work out ways to flank you and split your squad up. probably my favorite part about mass effect 3, is the story, obviously. everything is written so well, and is so believable, it makes me wonder how they got the game finnished, even by the date it was released. i mean yes, there are a lot of bugs, but when the game is such a large scale, you come to expect them. although i still wish they would have checked the game more thoroughly. i also keep hearing people complain about the romance options almost as much as the ending which is strange because it really isnt that different from the last 2 titles in the series. but im really not very sure of how its changed, because i didnt actually romance anyone in my first playthrough. it was an accident, somehow.",9,2012-03-13,XBOX 360,user

Truthful_Gamer,"I'm at the end of the game, and the frustration is overwhelming. My squad mates are so stupid they couldn't fight their way out of a wet paper bag. Even though I'm manually telling them to use their abilities. One hit kills abound from the reaper nearby, or the many banshees that close in on me because my squad keeps going down. And I'm playing on normal. The combat has been modified, they may call it improved but it's a poor attempt at ""Gearsifying"" Mass Effect. Shep is now one of the clunkiest characters i've ever played, but BioWare seemed to think the new abilities of diving around and swat turns make him capable of taking down multiple Geth Primes in close quarters, or multiple Phantoms with Nemisis support without breaking a sweat. What i'm trying to convey here is that BioWare have overestimated their combat tweaks. I'm playing as an engineer, using my abilities as much and as tactical as I did during the first two games, but it's making no difference. My sister is playing as a soldier class, she is finding it much easier, which leads me to believe this game is tailored for action. Not RPG. And i've finished the first two on insanity, so I know it's not my skill that's the problem here, just that I appear to be playing with the wrong character. Dialogue options are minimal. Your limited to saying pretty much what the writers want you to say. Your choices from the previous games amount to very little. I should have known this was going to be hugely dissapointing when I went to import my character and I received the error that my facial data could not be recognised. Seriously, that should have been sorted out early on in development. It's what Mass Effect is about, ""your"" Shepard, ""your"" choices. Some choices did carry through, with pleasing effects, but others were just worthless. I saw very little to do with homosexuality in this game, though I have NO problem with homosexuality. So there is little to worry about for the homophobes out there. There was one character, and I liked him. You may not, but then you don't have to speak to him if you don't want to. Another thing with squad mate interaction is there are a lot of instances of conversations like the ones you had with Zaeed, where you'll press A to talk but they just say ""good to see you"", but even worse is they'll have full conversations with you, you dont choose what you say, you just have a pre-destined converation. Like with Zaeed. This will happen more than you'd like. And don't get me started on that hideously cliched Cerberus assasin. At least killing that Jackass was satisfying. Overall A clunky action game, which may be enjoyed by newcomers to the series. For the followers this game may enrage you. I'll leave you with this piece of dialog from the game. Tali: I love you. Shepard: Keela se'lai. Really? How about a simple ""I love you too""?",6,2012-03-13,XBOX 360,user
Foojack100,"Decent game other that Bioware making mistakes like not following what happened in other games, as well as the end where you get essentially one ending that they changed the color on, pick your favorite color and watch the Galaxy be destroyed. Also they removed important content(From Ashes)and made it a DLC, if you have the game on computer you can get the DLC for free by editing a few codes of line in the game files.

Even the minor characters of the first two games have a role in Mass Effect 3, but the grand finale of the story is just awful. On top of that, Bioware lied (again) to the fans.

B3ckett,"ME3's ending = LOST ending ?!?! First of all - please disregard those 0's or 1's for user scores. Thats simply dumb and irrelevant. And it doesn't give this game proper credit. Let's hop to the review. I am a ME fan. A big one, I must say. I really enjoyed both ME1 and ME2, even as they were different games. Did I enjoy ME3? Hm... yes, but I am not overwhelmed. The ending CAN be dissapointing, but mostly due to the fact, that it depends on your overall score in SP and MP. Therefore BioWare wasn't completely honest with us. You HAVE to max out the MP experience and max out the SP experience for the best possible ending (with all possible choices). This is the game's biggest flaw - the ending. No matter how complete it is. It just ... brings the whole experience down. To be honest, I found the ending of my first game a complete atrocity. I think the best way to describe would be the Lost series finale. It feels exactly the same. We've been promised miracles, all the answers and we get... if you've seen it, you'll know what to expect. The rest of the story, on most occasions is proper, but feels written in a hurry. The chance of one of your comrades sacrificing for your cause is almost 90%. And it probably will happen - sooner or later. There are a lot more technical bug than in both games before, IMHO. The sound glitches ( you see the subtitles, you can't hear the voice), camera glitches or interface problems (for the first time in history I had trouble pressing a button due to the introduction of roll-overs for Shepard mapped to the same button). The visuals are generally better than before. The obvious anomaly is Ashley Williams. I am sorry, but her facial animations are at moments simply grotesque and I AM NOT ROMANCING that thing ever again (really!). The rest is, luckilly, better than okay. The lightning and models have been improved (in majority). Occasional glitches ruin the mood from time to time, but overally it's an enjoyable experience. The music is very well in the place it should be. Kudos for that. The MP experience is fun, quick paced and satisfactory. I bet I will spend a few hours enjoying it. To sum up - for a fan of this universe, the final moments are unworthy of the overall masterpiece that Mass Effect trilogy is. That's suprising, when it's a BioWare game. On the road to the finale a few tear bringing moments are to happen for sure. It's just that when you watch the ending, your eyes are dry and your somewhat bored. And that's the one thing I didn't expect from this game. Therefore, I can't give it more than a 9. If I didn't play the whole thing, it'd be an 8.",9,2012-03-13,XBOX 360,user
Senbonsakura,"First of all, ME is one of my favorite video game franchises. I completed the previous games a couple of times, I played all the DLCs and I have read all the comics and books. My expectations were very high and I was counting the days until ME3 finally hit the stores. Overall, except the last 10-15 minutes of the game (I will talk about this atrocity later), there is no reason to complain about this game. The game play is satisfying, your squad mates are likable, players are rewarded for playing the previous games with some special moments and the story is - as always - exciting and well told. The ME franchises proves how video games can make you care about characters you think about your actions. You can support or betray former squad mates and sacrifice entire civilizations for the greater good. If you played the previous games and developed any sympathy for the characters, there are no easy calls to make. Nothing seems right or wrong, which makes you care about your decisions and reflect them afterwards. But then comes the ending. To begin with, it is one of the most frustrating endings in video game history. As a big fan of the franchise and so much dedication, it felt like Bioware punched me in the face. For a company, that emphasizes their ability of good story telling and the possibility of influencing of the outcome of the story, this ending cannot be excused. It lets you down, does not reward you whatsoever, makes the previous games pointless, reveals all of your decisions as pointless and comes up with new questions, that remain unanswered. There is no reason to invest your emotions in the ME games again, with an ending like that. It feels like Bioware wanted to come up with something creative and unexpected. The ending was unexpected indeed, but a big letdown for every fan.",7,2012-03-13,XBOX 360,user

I'm not going to try to discredit an entire and incredible series because I didn't like the last 15 minutes. The real issue should be the game as a whole. The whole game is great. If you are considering buying don't let all of the whiny self entitled people sway your opinion, Mass Effect 3 is a beautiful game with great game play and an excellent narrative. I will agree that the wrap up felt like a bit of a cop out, maybe it way maybe it wasn't.

The ending made all the other games seem absolutely pointless to me. Seeing how nothing I did in the other games mattered in the end. I have to give it to Bioware, it must take careful planning on there part to be able to make a Bioware fanboy, who's favorite game series of all time was Mass Effect, completely hate their company and will never buy another Bioware product again. That is even before I realized that the ""From Ashes Mission"" was day one DLC we did not get for free. Bioware should be ashamed of what they have become.

levarien,"The amount of disinformation in the metacritic user reviews forced me to make an account. Here's the most frequent complains listed on 0/10 reviews, and why they are complete and utter nonsense. 1) Choices matter. Decisions from ME1 and ME2 will effect the course of the game. An asset lost in one of the previous games can effect your War readiness and alter the fate of shepherd and the galaxy as a whole. In the end, the choices effect the entire game, not just the ending. Imagine how different a mission would be if one of your ME2 characters died on the suicide mission. Play the game. Talk to a friend who played the game, I guarantee you'll have different stories. 2) The writing is thoroughly enjoyable. In fact, the character to character dialogue is the best of the series. The plot follows the same Organic versus Synthetic motif that has defined the series. Walking around the Citadel and the Normandy, I found myself awed at the level of detail these writers went to to make a vibrant and active world. Along with Skyrim, ME3 provides a level of immersion that is hard to find anywhere else. The romance, intrigue, and conflicts are still there, waiting to be uncovered. 3) The combat is much better than any point in the series. Powers and other abilities are extremely fun to mix and match, and the weapons are diverse and customizable. The devs did a great job preserving everything that made combat fun in ME2, and added some of the variety that mods and multiple weapons added from ME1. The cover mechanic received some welcome upgrades and the melee attack, while simple, is very satisfying. 4) Some people are actually complaining that the game betrays the lore and events of the previous game. I can't see how anyone can say this with a straight face. The very existence of the reapers always posed a question that hung over the series and was answered in an extremely well crafted way. 5) Day 1 DLC. We all know this is the real reason for all the trolling here. The DLC is just like the Zaeed and Kasumi packs from ME3. You don't need it for the ME experience. In fact, I found the added character to be a little bland. The best parts of the DLC were a few cutscenes. This is how the industry works now, either pay the pittance to play the DLC and argue about it if it disappoints, wait for the GOTY version and get it for free, or ignore it. But don't pretend like a wonderful game is ruined because a game publisher asked you to pay some money for some additional content.",10,2012-03-12,XBOX 360,user

Erathil,"Mass Effect 3 is a good game with some crippling flaws that prevent it from being great. Combat and gameplay are easily the best in the series; it retains 2's more visceral shooter-oriented changes while accommodating increased effectiveness of various powers and boosting elements of player choice. In short, it's the best of Mass Effect I and II; you can play as a gunning soldier or fight almost entirely through special abilities, and both are fully valid. While combat is a definitive improvement, changes with other aspects of gameplay are lateral at best. Gone are the earlier installments hacking mini-games (Yay!) and unwieldy vehicle segments (also, Yay!), but exploration seems significantly curtailed. Side missions are few and planetary exploration is gone, but I can't bring myself to miss either from Mass Effect 2. The tedious resource gathering aspect is scrapped, and in its place is a faster but no less vexing 'search and recover' mechanic. In a sense, de-focusing exploration makes perfect sense in the context of the game's story; the galaxy is at war with a race of synthetic invaders vastly more powerful than all native civilizations combined, and said armada is focused on the extermination of all advanced life. The story is darker than before, and if you listen to the NPCs talking around the game hubs you'll hear tragic stories of loss and hardship. The game's writing is, overall, superb; plot lines connect coherently and sync up with character motivations and development which extend over the course of the series. Mass Effect 2 had a couple truly touching moments, and it's clear to see that the authors wanted to replicate that here, too. They had mixed success; there are some very powerful, emotional moments, and a few that just fall flat due largely to the writing team just trying too hard. Mass Effect I and II were some of the best RPGs of this console generation, and I was ready to call ME3 the best of the lot... until the last half hour of the game. I should address some of the other concerns I've read here before going onto the game's true failing. The day one DLC is fun, entirely non-vital, and a decent investment if you like the game. It's absolutely comparable to the character DLCs in ME2, and I personally don't find anything to object to about it. The inclusions of multiplayer had me weary, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by how fun it ends up being. Shooter fans may find it simplistic and lacking, but if you like Mass Effect's combination of guns and special abilities, then you'll probably get a kick out of it. As it is, it's the only thing I've ever seen in four years to make me buy an Xbox Live gold pass. Really, the game is great... right until the ending. The grand resolution to the Mass Effect trilogy, easily the most engaging RPG franchise of the last five years... simply ****. It's pointlessly arbitrary, nonsensical, and deeply unsatisfying. The sheer sense of betrayal it left me with makes it easy for me to understand the slew of negative reviews on this site. Allegedly, there are sixteen endings with variations along three primary choices you make in the last minutes of the game, but they're almost identical and all disgusting. I can't recall such a sharp whiplash in tone and enjoyment. It's the sort of ending that **** the fun out of a franchise. If the ending **** trilogy had been... well, better, I would have happily given ME3 a 9/10. It improves on so many things of its predecessors (combat flow, character design, strategic choices, enemy variety, the list goes on), but in the end it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. It came so close, and it could have easily been so much better...",6,2012-03-12,XBOX 360,user

The ending of the game destroys any gamer with emotional involvement in the game, by giving them a whitewashed, uniform ending that it is GUARANTEED every other player got. Bioware made you believe that you were something special, only to strip it away and laugh as you were wondering what just happened. This game gets a 0, because it is the ONLY game I've ever played to destroy the re playability of other games for me.

Matrixcvd,"I experienced quite a few bugs, which did impact game, dialogue not working right, etc. Bottom line regardless of what you think of the endings, the build up to the ""final"" battle was suppose to be the best part ""Save Earth"", don't bother playing after 20 hours its just not worth it. Think Halo2, its just a joke how awful the back end of this game is, the missions are pathetic, the content on earth is short, and really just a total let down. So the end gameplay ****, nothing interesting, or at least content that tries to differentiate itself from bulk, its all bland and boring. Which makes the ending options really forgettable, there is no point in playing through the game differently. So to recap, after the initial sequence on earth, there is nothing emotionally driven about the content, its all vapor, there is no challenging sections (scaled for difficulty), and the endings are loose, trival, and without an emotional connection to tie things apart, or together. I could care less if my character is killed, but its the story that ties the content together and there IS NO STORY to feed off of, 2/3 of the game had me in tears, i blew through the dialogue toward the latter stages and ending because there was nothing there. what a waste of time. I picked up ME series late, after all the DLC hit for ME2, so I knew it was a long slog and a wait to see ME3, but the content for ME2, knowing full well the inconclusive nature was much better than the, ""climax"" of ME3. If the bar is set high, then sometimes you get hit with the bar, I had more fun toward the end of Kingdoms of Amalur, than this game, which is a terrible mocking. ME3 end with bad taste, disappointment, and general disgust, and not cause of how the game ended, but the quality of the final battle, the lack of emotional/character content, and the complete package just sinks after such a great start.",3,2012-03-12,XBOX 360,user

Thevakarian,"So, just finished this game, and i completely disagree with everything any of the bad reviews have said. The combat is improved for the better, and a lot of customization has been re introduced from ME1, with out the inventory overload the first game had, or the streamlining the second had. Don't get me wrong, I loved ALL 3 of the games. The only problems i had with this game were technical problems; Some lip sync bugs and a few audio cut outs, but that may have been attributed to my headset. The true purpose of the Reapers is actually very interesting, albeit that it was exactly what I expected. If you have closely listened to the dialogue of Reapers in the past 2 games, you should somewhat expect it. THE ENDING IS NOWHERE NEAR AS BAD AS PEOPLE MAKE IT OUT TO BE. I am getting sick and tired of people complaining about the ending. Yes, it's sad, characters die depending on your readiness level, and some characters just die anyways, which is one other complaint I have, but it's a small one. The ending is a tear jerker, and I wish there was a happier resolution, but all in all, it concludes the series extremely well, and leaves it open for more **** If Bioware did release something that had a happy resolution, I would most likely pay for it, but it doesn't really matter to me. In short, this game is nowhere near as bad as all of you haters make it out to be.

In fact, I bought my Xbox 360 to play this series. The ending of this game invalidates all the choices the character/player has made over three games. Not only that the resolution deviates from the theme of the series in a strange presenting choices that seem to contradict the message about the power of individuals to shape their own future.

supertime556677,"The game was excellent, with more in depth side quests and far better combat than even the second game. The battles were challenging and as epic as one would expect for the finale of the Mass Effect series. Up until the last 10 minutes. The AI child refers to itself as both ""I"" and ""we"". They couldn't even proofread the ending script. That's not the worst part. Yes, the endings are depressing. I'm fine with that. What I'm not fine with is the fact the ending contains major, obtrusive plot holes. Characters who are with you in the final battle someone come back from the dead and end up on the Normandy, which is for some reason in the midst of running from some random beam of color, in the span of 5 minutes. Really? Furthermore, the same characters are shown in flashbacks at the end, no matter if they've been dead since the second game or they're not even you love interest. That's just looking at the game alone. Comparing it to the rest of the series, the ending does not make sense. It is not artistic. It's not bad because its a tragic ending. It doesn't mesh with the story leading up to it. Why, if the citadel controls the reapers, did it not just allow them to jump in during the events of the first game? The ending is so bad that I regret giving $60 to EA/Bioware. I don't want to pay for DLC with a better ending. I expect to to not fork out $60 for a game with a nonsensical half-assed ending to a series that I spent well over 200 hours and $200 on. I gave the game a +1 since the first 99% of it was excellent.

When EA admitted that the CORE aspects of the DLC had been integrated in the the game prior to certification, I wanted to return the game for a refund.

Kinzler,"This review is from the perspective **** who has diligently played all 3 games of the series and has easily sunk 200+ hours into the trilogy. As such, it is aimed towards that group of players. ME1 & ME2 are quite possibly my two favorite games of all time. They created a universe in which you felt an emotional attachment to your Shepard. If this sounds absurd, tell me there wasn't multiple times where you carefully considered what decision to make because you were concerned with the repercussions your Shepard could face. ME2 trimmed down on some of the RPG elements of the original, but overall I thought that this decision by Bioware helped improve the flow of the story and feel of the gameplay. Granted, ME2 didn't do a great job of incorporating your decisions from ME1 besides who you left behind while on Virmire but it was forgivable because it was assumed that all the lose ends would be tied up in ME3, the epic conclusion to this space saga. Sadly, however, I must report that ME3 does not live up to the pedigree of its predecessors. My first qualm with ME3 is the structure of the quests. The main plot quests are adequate but the side quests are terrible. The side quests lack any depth or meaning whatsoever and consist mainly of simple fetch-quests. The prior 2 games had side quests that were much more exciting and fleshed out. The shallowness of the side quests is a major detractor for ME3. The second glaring problem is the lack of player involvement in the conversation gameplay elements. In the prior two games, the player was constantly given meaningful conversation choices to make that, if they didn't necessarily change the outcome of the conversation, completely changed the tone and outlook of the conversation. The amount of involvement that the player is given in conversations in ME3 is outrageously limited and the sense of importance that dialogue options had previously is gone in the third installment. The lack of emphasis on conversation choices brings about the next major problem with ME3, its de-emphasis on characters. ME1 & ME2 both prided themselves on emphasizing that you were the leader of part of a team. They enabled you to have fleshed out conversations with your crew members and with other fascinating characters spread throughout the galaxy. ME3 abandons this. You can only converse with your squad mates when it is convenient for the game and there is almost no interaction with the other people that populate this universe. Try walking around the Citadel and engaging with someone. You will be hard-pressed to do so. The first two installments were not nearly as limiting. As a result, in ME3 you do not feel as attached to your crew and to the universe as you previously were. Quick problem: the absence of any civilian cities besides the Citadel in ME3 is a major letdown. Omega, Feros, Illium, and Tuchanka added nice flavor to the first two games. ME3 has no such variety and the Citadel is not capable of remaining interesting by itself. No let me turn my attention to the idiotic ""Galaxy at War"" system. Forcing people to play multiplayer so as to increase the galaxy at war multiplier is ridiculous. The boneheadedness behind this idea is almost incomprehensible. It was a terrible idea. Next up on the list of problems is the most important of all: The Endings. The ending of ME3 will leave you flabbergasted, speechless, and incredulous. The different endings are really not much different from each other at all. They conclude the story on a terrible, terrible note. There is no closure, just depressing consequences and glaring plot holes. The logic put on display by one particular character introduced at the end is just abhorrent and you are shoehorned into three choices that have no positive ending. I am not saying that every possible ending should have been a positive one but for a series that prides itself on choice a nice ending MUST have been included. Do not spend a lot of time playing multiplayer to get the multiplier up, none of the choices offered are much different and be ready to see consequences that do not make any sense based on people and things you had just seen a moment earlier. If you are looking for a positive ending, good luck. Additionally, the ending, whichever on you choose, does not incorporate any of your prior major decisions. The endings are so bad and they make me regret pouring as much time into ME1 & ME2 as I did. The day 1 DLC is an insult to consumers everywhere and the companies involved should be ashamed of themselves for withholding content so as to make a couple extra bucks. In conclusion: The game lacks much of the choice and atmosphere of its predecessors. It is apparent that this game was extensively stripped down so as to appeal to a wider audience. It lacks depth in nearly all of its gameplay departments and contains mainly needless additions. And last but not least, THE ENDINGS ARE COMPLETE RUBISH AND RUIN THE ENTIRE FRANCHISE!",1,2012-03-12,XBOX 360,user
alqualonde,"A fantastic game series totally obliterated by one of the most banal, non-sensical endings in history. If the lame ending of Dragon Age 2 pissed you off, the ending of ME3 will prompt you to send your PC tower flying through the window and skidding into the street, where you will leave it in hopes of being run over by a car so you might be able to forget this entire series existed.

SisterSafetyPin,I've never had my love for an entire game series completely negated by the last games ending. I've never felt so.... ****ing angry about an ending that I considered immediately trading my Collectors edition back in for almost anything else... And I bought Fable 3. From game one of Mass Effect it was said that our choices matter; and that importing your character from ME1 to ME3 would create stacked outcomes... And yet none of that was true. It was said that playing Multiplater wasn't needed to get the best possible ending. But that wasn't true either. I completed every side-quest and was a full paragon... And the ending ****.

micro4,"Let me be vary clear i am not going to complain about the graphics the Homosexuality or the glitches. With the level of coding needed to facilitate a game like this with so many choices and paths to take it is expected. If you want a gay or lesbian Shepard more power to you. As a matter of fact on My second play-through i may just try that with my Female renegade, but we shall see. What really made me drop to my knees and cry what really killed this game for me was the ending. Without giving anything away let me explain. All those choices that you made, all those people you met, all those romances you had, AMOUNT TO NOTHING. No mention no nothing. Let me be clear i have no problem with a bittersweet ending. If lets say Shepard had no choice and all he could do to save his world and the Woman/Man he loves is to end his own life then sure by all means but treat it as such. Better yet do it gently. Or make it after a grand final battle. No such thing happens. A lot of people were complaining about the negativity of the ending. If the end would have been handled with a little more care i would not be as angry sad and frustrated. Let me be clear this games took me 35 hours to complete combining the game play from all three that led to this finally i had a grand total of 126 hours of game-play mostly from 1 and 2 respectively. To then tell me that all that work and toil and sweat and sleepless nights amounts to nothing is more then just saddening. It is a swift kick to the nuts. A sudden pain radiating up your back toward your stomach. I actually played the ending again the first time just to make sure i did not make a mistake, and then a played it a third time just to be sure. I actually contemplated throwing this game out the window. Something i had never done before. However if you let your anger subside as i did after about a day. You will go back watch the end again let the credits finish rolling and hear how what you have done throughout the game has become the stuff of legend. Many cry foul at this but i see it as a nod from Bioware to keep going and persevere and try again. That and the Game itself leading up to the last ten minutes are what kept me from giving this thing anything less then a five. You will like the game, up untill you make your final push for the transporter. After that you will cry, you will be angry, you will be speechless. You will try again and again to find the truth and you will fail. Bioware has tried and failed to resist EA Greed. First Red Alert 3 and now this. I am done with you EA. Here is a quick list of the game series EA has ruined. Command and Conquer: RED ALERT Mass Effect 3 007 Command and Conquer Dungeon Master Sim (name here) These are just the ones I've played. These are big series too. Congrats EA with this you have pissed off Sci-Fi fans across the world.

Kevinj37,"I love this game and Bioware games in general. Great story, great characters, I actually felt regret when I had to make a tough call in the Geth storyline. I haven't finished yet and I've been playing constantly since it came out- tons of content! Would have given it a ten, except I deducted one point for the DLC BS they pulled, and 1 point for the multi-player, which I can't access because I don't happen to know any other players, and public games are inaccessible to first-time players (tried to join one and was immediately booted, presumably for my level).

BizzleTheDon,"Honestly, Bioware cut corners on this game, and what could have been a hit with both critics (who are clearly paid for by major developers) AND fans, turned into a minor black eye on what is otherwise an excellent trilogy. This IS a good game, but it is flawed when it didn't have to be. A few more months and Bioware could've spent the time developing three alternate endings, as opposed to copy and pasted versions of the same ending that completely eradicated any feeling of your decisions up to that point feeling like they mattered worth nothing. In addition to that, they also could have formulated answers for the clear plot holes in the game. (SPOILER ALERT!!: Who is the being on the Citadel who created the Reapers? What made them come to that decision? Why would the Normandy be in FTL Travel when clearly, they were orbiting Earth assisting the crew?) They also could have worked out to numerous kinks in the cover system, such as popping out of cover when you change weapons, or not returning to cover when popping out to fire.) Other issues include glitches that freeze your game or cause characters to disappear during talking scenes. I believe there was definitely a money grab mentality here. I point to a multiplayer that has very little depth in light of other XBL Shooters, but is a necessity to play if you want your galactic fleet to be at full strength. By forcing that on players, it assures that those who bought the game used will have to buy a pass to play the online Multi. Also, the entire ""From Ashes"" DLC could have been integrated into the game itself. In the end, there are many flaws with this game. However, none of them stop the game from being fantastic up until the ending. And if it helps: If you haven't played this game to the end? Take my advice: ONLY CHOOSE ONE ENDING AND DO NOT PLAY THE OTHERS. It will ruin it the experience.",8,2012-03-12,XBOX 360,user

Armiga21,"As a fan of the previous two games, I was disappointed with this final installment. The third installment is unfortunately rifled with a lot of dumbing down of the franchise. Conversation choices have been severely limited, as have the number of dialog choices; especially those which actually matter. This comes into play for the worst in the ending which is a huge disappointment, to say the least. The series hailed itself as choice since the beginning, but the way your choices end up affecting the ending seem to be arbitrary at best. It's also unfortunate multiplayer is required to get the best ending possible. I believe you can get it if you make very specific choices in the campaign (i.e. not all Paragon or all Renegade, you need a guide in your lap to mix and choose very specific ones) but chances are you won't get it without a guide. Multiplayer itself feels very tacked on and more of a mandate by the publisher, similar to how I felt on Multiplayer in Bioshock 2.",5,2012-03-12,XBOX 360,user
zotune,"The new standard of decision-making and storytelling in games, Mass Effect 3 sets an example of a narrative which will make you consider your decisions thoroughly, or regret otherwise. The Clint Mansell composed music is emotional and the soundtrack pays homage to many sci-fi series of the past with its electronic touch - the presentation is also exquisitely refined with vastly improved lighting and art design which far exceeds most games. That being said, besides an otherwise improved combat system, the enemies are quite dull and mainly runs towards you in a very outdated and unintelligent fashion. I also resent the idea of having to purchase the Day 1 DLC, especially in this case since it involves a major story arc which should have been part of the game in the first place - and I refuse to endorse the abuse of loyal fans who have become invested in the story thus far, and are being exploited monetarily in order to have complete narrative experience. To purposely leave out the answers to some of the most important questions in this otherwise wonderful sci-fi universe comes across as non-appreciation towards loyal fans, and I cannot with my principles intact overlook such an inconsiderate move upon giving a numerical score - in addition to the publisher's behavior towards Windows fans who were not able to buy the game for their Steam library along with previous installments and the rest of their collection, making the whole process very inconvenient for them as consumers. In regards to previous installments it is an improvement in certain aspects such as the leveling system, at the same time however, Mass Effect 3 also appears more dumbed down by introducing genre stereotypes such as characters who seem to have been put in place only to appeal to a more casual audience - instead of remaining true to the initial values of the series. To conclude, this is quite possibly one of my favorite sci-fi universes, and I cannot recommend the journey enough. Though towards the end of the ride I didn't truly feel like I was given complete closure, and the game wasn't quite the improvement Mass Effect 2 was either. All in all I don't think I'm alone in conveying my dislike for the way BioWare has decided to treat their loyal fans. I would still recommend the game to those who would like to see how it all ends, though I would add to that recommendation and advise to disregard the DLC, and perhaps buy the game at a later date - when it's much cheaper. Because otherwise publishers such as EA will continue to set a bad example by withholding important content for monetary gain in order to exploit gamers.",8,2012-03-12,XBOX 360,user

SuperkenGaming,"Mass Effect 3 Legendary Edition Go google pictures of Mirandas butt Mass Effect 3 is the final chapter of Sheards story youre off to end the reapers, this race of beings that threaten the existence of the universe as you know it… I didn’t play the original version, but here in Mass Effect 3 you have the option to play RPG style or action style… as someone that played the last 2 games I love the choice aspect of this series so I chose to mainline the story with the rpg elements here.. choosing my dialog.. unfortunately though the game doesn’t make it hard for you to just b line to the end in about 12 hours. Why? Because this just ist the least interesting game in the trilogy.. it just is.. you already know which charcters you like in this universe.. and there aren’t really anymore to fall in love with before the big showfdown.. so I just didn’t care to do the side missions, especially with just how repetitive the main campaign felt.. why would i? I had no insentive to explore and go do more.. that being said mass Efect 3 is decently enjoyable to play through.. You will get more squadmembers as the story goes on, youll be picking out their special abilities, and they do become an important part of your arsenal.. for example Liara was a stple for me to deal with annoying shielded enemies, I loved how on command I could have her just throw any enmy in the eir right in front of me.. so it really is up to you to baance your squad of 3 to your play style.. I do wish however there was more information given to me before a mission s maybe I was more throughful about the 2nd member… if I ever had anyone different it was mostly because the tory forced it on me.. in general mass effect 3 does an awful job at pre gaming… you have to chose your loadout before you go in.. having no idea what youll be dealing with ahead of time.. it makes literally 0 sense for me to not change my loadout based on my current situation on the fly… it ultimately lead to me not relly trying out any guns after I had one I was pretty satisfied… If mass Effect 3 werent the bow ontop of a series I had to see the end of after a huge investment into 1 and 2… I probably wouldn’t have been so invested to see it through.. it lies on the shoulders of the success of the perevious games and sadly doesn’t live up to the world building standards they set… While I did enjoy going through this campaign and putting an end to this intergalactic war… by itself, mass effect 3 isnt all that great.

Kai82,"It is the Game of Thrones ending equivalent in video games. I asked myself: Can an ending ruin a game? Yes. A trilogy? Yes. A franchise? Maybe, but Mass Effect Andromeda hurt the franchise (and BioWare) at least as much. The Mass Effect trilogy was about decisions and we discussed about our decisions and outcomes. Then we finished Mass Effect 3 and nearly everyone was disappointed. BioWare made even a survey about the ending on their website which they removed quickly and silently because of the results. I haven't touched my Mass Effect games since then (I replay my favourite games once in a while) and we didn't discuss any-more. They rushed the game and don't know how to finish it. BioWare did a better job in Baldurs Gate 2 and Dragon Age. Here they showed you the outcomes for your characters and decisions in a meaningful way. Back to the game: It does a lot right. You can say “The playtime is over”. Now the real **** starts. You will be thrown in a dire battle for survival as the whole galaxy is struggling. It creates this feeling of dread as you proceed trough the story. You are the archiver of miracles and bane to your enemy's but you don't turn the tide of war just that easy. The main and side stories are really good with some exceptions. Some outcomes are insignificant at best while others are simply amazing (Wont spoil). You recruit again old friends and a new character (or 2 depends on point of view). My favourites are again Liara, Garrus, Joker, EDI, Anderson, Aria, Thane and Steven Hacket. What harms this game is the Illusive Man. He did an awesome job in Mass Effect 2 but should not be in the role he is in this game. Also Kai Lang is a waste of a character and has no real purpose (He was originally from a Mass Effect book and there he was a badass and interesting character). I will also mention that this game has the best final attack (motivational) speech in video games history. There are also so many good and sad emotional moments. I had tears in my eyes at some points. This are clearly signs **** game and I will defend this statement as much as I will complain about the ending. The battle system is working well but is a decline from Mass Effect 2. I will also mentioned that I had some bugs in this game and could even not finish a quest because of it (Overall the number was tolerable). There were also many good branches for decisions from Mass Effect 1 / 2. I will praise this. Lets get to my final verdict: This is a great game which is an 8-9/10. Then comes the abysmal ending that ruins this trilogy. It crushes all expectations and destroyed the replayability. For details see the list of the famous YouTuber Angry Joe or watch the YouTube video which compares all endings (at once) and you will see what got the community enraged. They later tried to fix this with a free DLC (Really good material) but it was to late. The reviving with Mass Effect Andromeda failed miserable (The “My face is tired” meme is hilarious). It could have been the Star Wars for video games and I liked the characters (Some would be in my top 10 list), lore, history, races and nearly everything in the games. I will give 1/10 because I don't believe in a 0/10 rating except for Fallout 76 which fully deserves this rating.",1,2020-01-31,PLAYSTATION 3,user

The first days I didn't have internet so I wasn't able to upload the upgrades. Probably because of this I had to stand twice seeing my character talking to I don't know who. But even when I upgraded the game I still found a few issues. Nothing big but still, they could have fix that. A part from this when you change the floor in your ship the first seconds you see the screen dark and you have to wait before moving, they could have fix that as well. But if you forgive this tiny things you will enjoy another great game with Shepard. In this game you'll see that everything is the same with a few different things because games have always to be different. To sum up, if you liked Mass Effect 2 you definitely need to buy this game. Plus, when you start this game you can decide to continue with the information of the previous game or not. I did and they did a good work giving you that choice. It took me 28 hours having done most things so it can take you 20-25 if you go directly to the main story. Hackett out.",10,2018-05-19,PLAYSTATION 3,user

GmoBarrientos,"Pros: La mejor jugabilidad de la trilogía, historia bien interesante, los Reaper en su máxima expresión y gravedad Contras: los DLC ""leviatan"" y Javik jamás debió ser contenido ""adicional""; por la relevancia en la historia, deberían haberse incluído por defecto Respecto del final, el final ""parchado"" esta bien, pese a la polémica,la situación a la que llegan los acontecimientos era tan grave que tampoco podía esperarse un final ""Disney"".

Jaleo,"While it should have improved ME2, it didn't. Well, the gameplay improved, and other very little details. Where all were expecting it to be a mix between ME1 and ME2 (more exploring, more RPG) it ended up being the typical 3rd person shooter, with dialogues and options. Talking about these, they ended up being not so important, all those decisions you took in ME1 and 2, had little repercussion in ME3. Thankfully the sounding system was removed, but also way too simplified. Same goes with exploring. And all you do is fight humans or reapers, you miss fighting other species. And well, let's not talk about those endings before the update... big slap in people's faces. I tend to think that lately games don't have those 20 min endings like before, that the whole gaming experience is the ending itself. But we still want to sit back and enjoy a little movie for 15 min. And then they came up with that... thing. They kinda tried to fix it afterwards, but the damage was done... On the other hand it included an interesting online mode, which they tried to prolongate its life with updates and packs but I guess it died soon. Let's hope ME Andromeda wont follow ME3 steps...",7,2017-01-13,PLAYSTATION 3,user

bfoore90,"When I look at Mass Effect 3, most of the time all that I see is lost and unfulfilled potential followed by empty promises made by the greed of EA and the video game industry. Let me start out by saying that Mass Effect 3, despite its flaws is still a very good game but the problem for me is that it could have been a great game, a game that could have ended Shepard's story the right way. The game play and graphics are on point and mark some of the best improvements in the franchise, the cast of returning characters (especially Ashley for me) was a delight after the mixed bag with some gems that we got in Mass Effect 2 and the story, up until maybe late in the 2nd half around the time you arrive on Ranncok plays the strings of your heart masterfully as it gives you the sense that this is the end for Shepard and his crew that you've grown to love as family. Mass Effect 3 had all the makings of a classic sci FY epic but unfortunately got lost somewhere in a pissing contest between EA and Bioware. The game's problem's go far beyond the craptastic Deus Ex Machina logic devoided ending that we recieved as the game plays more like a first person shooter than a classic RPG like Mass Effect 1. Also alot of the choices seem to really lack depth, feeling and the consequence and the story is almost too linear as compared to Mass Effect 1; the story also seems to suffer from many choices that almost seemed forced by the storyline than anything else. In regards to the characters, alot of the Mass Effect 2 squad mates are basically reduced to cameos and the returning characters other than maybe Liara (Bioware's golden girl), Garrus and Tali suffer from a lack of decent screentime and proper handling that affects their development at the core. I stayed faithful to Ashley through the first two games and while I enjoyed her relationship in ME3 it almost felt like the writers left out alot of content that could have helped further her character in the long haul. What ultimately hurt Mass Effect 3 for me was, you guessed it, the ending. The ending of this game really destroyed the series as a whole for me, it almost completely feels forced, lazy and filled with plot holes and lack of overall choice. For instance, It's stated in Mass Effect 1, as a major story of the Mass Effect 1 game, that the Citadel is a giant mass relay used by the Reapers as an entry point to the galaxy and that the Keepers of the Citadel are altered by the Protheans so they ignore the Reapers control signals, making their return impossible. However by the end of Mass Effect 3 the player learns that the Catalyst, who controls the Reapers and also the Keepers (who at this point in game are serving the Catalyst in processing the human bodies) is housed on the Citadel itself. That revelation makes the existence of a major ME3 plot point completely irrelevant and useless. You leave the game's ending feeling lost, depressed and drained as the ending almost completely undoes anything this game does good. Bioware/EA were arrogant to rush the production of this game which allowed a very incomplete game to hit the shelves on release day as well as ignorant to think that the Mass Effect fanbase would allow them to get away with this crime unpunished. Its sad because Mass Effect 3 should have been the vehicle to send Shepard and his crew off the right way, instead were left with Shepard in a pile of rubble and people making up indoctrination theories to try and justify just how bad this game was.",8,2016-11-07,PLAYSTATION 3,user
RunePl,"Worth slogging through the tedious first and second games for this. You need to do that to truly care about the events in this game, although ultimately your decisions only have to do with who lives and dies(and the decisions on life or death in the first two games were usually unclear as to the result anyway). The pacing and plot were done exactly right. This was the first game where decisions actually seemed to matter, and I legitimately had to think over. Most importantly, your decision had the intended consequence, including dialogue(opposite of the Mass Effect 2 guessing game). This never happened in the second game, and rarely in the first. the graphics are unreal and totally immersive. Same with the sound and voice acting. As far as the negatives. The endings were basically ripoffs of the Deus Ex endings, not THAT bad except you don't get a choice in the ending unless you grind side quests. The only steps back I'd say were the gameplay(Press X for anything so it never does what you want it to, and the weapons although diversified had no kick to them like in the first two), and the world building(took a step back from the quest hubs in ME 2). Enemy and Team AI was much better this time around.",9,2016-05-27,PLAYSTATION 3,user
Joker92,"Now, I was a late comer into the Mass Effect universe, so I never went through the disappointment of the original ending. That said, this masterpiece is beyond words. Especially if you started from the first game and had imported your character to the other two, well, lets just say all three games will have you plaything through the trilogy multiple of times with each time being unique due to all the classes and choices. It's very rare for a gem to come along that gives you that certain emotional feeling that only gamers' that invest themselves into the art can know, and this and its predecessors are one of those gems. It's too bad the rating for this had been messed up by the original ending, but any other late comers be at ease. There is a free extended cut that restores this to the 9/10 10/10 gem that it is.",10,2015-10-26,PLAYSTATION 3,user

Asellas,"Ok, well I can say that I did enjoy the game as a whole. It has a great story to it, that does mostly conclude the series. The main issue for me was though is the ending itself. The ending is well with the so called Extended DLC they shouldn't have had to do in the first place, was just three seperate color lapses over one another. Of course you can also not choose any of the three endings and then just all die for nothing basically. Anyways, I careless about Shep living or **** me I just wanted something far more expansive and less lazy than the mass relays blowing up and the crew putting up a memorial. In fact to me the ending just left me with doubt on Biowares next series for Mass Effect frankly since they just lost all steam with that worthless end. The ending aside, the companions were definitely lack luster. Instead of getting the awesome companions from MAss Effect 2 back you get some prothean that's so elitist it's not even funny, a Robot just so Joker gets some romance going on, and the overly hardcore stereotyped soldier man in Vega, thats about it. You do get Garrus, Liara, Tali, & Ash or Kaiden depending on who was left alive. Kasumi, Zaeed, Miranda, Jack, Jacob....Anyone else you fell in love with as characters in the second game are basically gone save for a few meet ups...I really wish they came back to be companions again, instead of just random cameos. I can understand a few old characters not coming back sure, the story needed that, but for none of the others? Come ****'t give us great characters just to turn around and take them back...Anyhow, that rant being done I enjoyed the **** ran well and even was great in wrapping some things up. So I give it a 7...Since the ending and companions definitely put a damper on it for me.",7,2015-07-26,PLAYSTATION 3,user
Lustwaffel,"Between the time of 2007 and 2014 I, due to life and career happenings, and neither time nor interest in the subject, I did not play any games. Before that, too much. But I thought I should try and see how it feels again, with the state of things as they are now and with a little time on my hands. So I, not only but mostly, played Mass Effect 2 and 3 three, consequtively. Bascialy, what I have to say is... I am shocked with the arrogance of game makers that I feel is there when I look at the way the third game comes to a close. Even with the extended cut DLC. What a TRAUMATIC experience... So you walk around the galaxy, interact with so many people, espcially on the citadel and then... uuuups, by the way, everyone is dead. And here they are, littered around on the ground in big heaps... Now get over it. I am quite proud of my, still largely, intact emotional anntenas. If I wanted this kind of thing I could have watched several Holocaust Documentaries. But that would hardly go through as ""Entertainment"". The world is a dark place and there are a lot of horrible conflicts in it. To me, this kind of game should not be made. There might be some completely dettached individuals or groups of individuals who deem otherwise, but those shurley have neither really lived nor known anyone who has. With all of its variables. I really can t cope with that kind of punishment that seems to be such a viable method for dealing with the gamer in the gaming experience now a **** your peoples perception of entertainment. But looking at the scores I can see that I am not completely alone. A bug prevented me from making a the choice in the very last part of the game and in a forum a guy wrote: ""Dont worry, the game is trying to prevent you from seeing the ending thereby saving valulble IQ points..."" I feel, I shouldnt even have come that far. It is really all rather embarrasing. When people invest so much effort in making you emotionaly attached to rip out our heart in the last second I presume only the masochistcly inclined would truly be satisfied. I was... disgusted.

Heisenberg93,"When I started playing Mass Effect 3 I was afraid: some said it was a masterpiece, others that it was a bad game, many said that the ending was not nice. I did not know where the truth was, I knew that I would find the truth only playing the game. I'll start talking about the gameplay, graphics and then finally the plot. This is the report. The gameplay of ME 3 is confused: the rpg section of the game is now almost non-existent. Exploration is reduced to ridiculous levels and has been completely removed the planetary extraction of minerals. Even the player's mastery in handling the dialogue has been reduced to the bone, even the dialogue options are reduced. The codex and the management of the missions is stupid: not only I can not examine in detail the current mission, but there isn't a division between primary mission and side quests. The only component revalued were the stats of weapons and power-ups, which had been removed in ME 2, and an interesting addition were the War Assets, useful in managing the resources acquired to be used in the final battle against the Reapers. The longevity of the game is reduced compared to the first and second chapter. What to say? It is confusing, in fact. I don't understand why BioWare doesn't know just to make things better, and why do back and forth between the elements of gameplay, between a chapter and the next. Adds something, but removes something else. It is not that the game is not fun, but in this way the game appears to be inconsistent. The graphics of the game is really beautiful, BioWare has taken advantage of the Unreal Engine 3 giving the game a look good. The best thing in the game. The soundtrack, as usual, is very beautiful. The plot of Mass Effect 3 was not bad. I liked how things were going, and even if the story had been a little slow at the start, I was having fun and seemed destined to end in an epic way. In fact I loved the plot of Mass Effect 3 from the first minute to the last one. The endings and the choices available are good. The problem is their explanation. Regardless of the ending obtained, there isn't a real explanation for what has happened throughout the game. And no one knows what really happens after. When I saw it for the first time I was blown away: I've been thinking for days, checking other opinions on the Internet, asking the cause of everything. Then I heard about the Extended Cut, a free dlc released by BioWare that should had answer to unresolved questions. It should had an explanation of all that happened. Actually I already knew about this dlc but, sinning of naivete, I decided not to download it and to leave the game in its original form. Maybe I was right, maybe not. The fact is that the Extended Cut ends the saga of Mass Effect in a more than decent way, giving the necessary explanations. The only question is: why a dlc? Why BioWare did not include the Extended Cut directly into the game? Why BioWare did not think immediately to put it in the game? So in conclusion? Mass Effect 3 is a good game, not loyal to what was the first chapter, but fun and with a beautiful plot from start to finish. Too bad that the game doesn't explain anything to the endings, and to explain decently the end of the game is served a dlc. I understand the anger of many fans. Too bad it went how it went.",8,2015-04-06,PLAYSTATION 3,user

narikolives,"Here's a simple analysis: the fan reviews are so emotionally polarized that they're essentially useless. Quite a few are outright lies (a review below this one states ""The dialogue is gone, even with full decisions on it's like watching a movie instead of an interactive story"" -this is a blatant falsehood unless the reviewer had the sound off and subtitles disabled) and too many are backlash up-votes in the same vein as their rage-driven down-vote counterparts. Read the critical reviews if you're after actual information. For my money it's an excellent game critically tarnished by EA's terrifyingly stupid decision to push for a quick ending over just finishing it up to the standards of the rest of the game (and series).",9,2015-01-18,PLAYSTATION 3,user

erhanz,"Finished the last installment on this sci-fi series last week. So basically i play the game and load my save files from ME2. So my review is going to be based on my storyline. Shepard was detained back on earth because he sacrificed a batarian's planet to delay the reaper invasion. In the meantime, every species is getting ready for the war with the reaper. Suddenly the Reaper invades Earth. Shepard, once again go back to the outer space to get help from all species in the galaxy. Can Shepard make it? Will he get back in time with the help needed? Play and find out yourself. Plus point: - A total upgrade in the graphic level. The main characters' expression and details are much much better in this game. Also the new weapon and armor system, makes the game more interesting. - If you load the save files from the previous game, whatever you did on the prequels, will affect the story on this game. And there are so many reccuring characters from the trilogy. - Great conclusion to the story. I finished the game with the perfect ending within my first gameplay. Well, of course while finishing all of the other DLCs, such as Omega, From The Ashes, Citadel, Leviathan. It's like every creatures on the galaxy is lending a hand to shepard for the war with the Reaper. The game is full pf actions, i mean you fight a gigantic reaper with only Scanning Laser Gun for an all out attack? That's intense and awesome. - Garrus, Garrus, Garrus! My partner since ME1 and the best and coolest characters of ME Trilogy, and he's back once again. Minus Point: - I played the game on PS3, so the game is not that smooth. Sometimes there are some jaggy scene, i guess the console itself isn't powerful enough for this game, which is such a letdown. - You can choose your ending! Well although only one leads to Perfect Ending, and of course if you have enough Paragon points and Effective Military Strength for it. But that's kinda ignoring our play style of paragon or renegade. Because in the end they gave you a choice for the ending. It'll be better if you play as Paragon, you automatically gets the Paragon ending, without choosing other options. - Well, not exactly a minus point, but almost all of the characters on ME2 won't join as playable characters. I kinda miss Thane. The Verdict: I must say, i'm not much of a fan of sci-fi, but this series totally blew my mind. ME3 is a full action pack game with great stories. We could see how desparate Shepard is to save Earth from the Reaper, His love story with Ashley, His sadness when losing comrades, this game is not just a simple game with shoot and destroy, but it brings some of the emotional feeling in it. I totally love ME trilogy and one of the best game i ever played. If only they could fix the frame rate problem, then this game is flawless. 8.5/10",8,2014-06-30,PLAYSTATION 3,user

mmrventricle,"why so many haters wtf? I know I cant talk any sense into those morons who give this game a 0 just because of the ending but ARE YOU FAKING KIDDING ME? HOW CAN 10 MINUTES IN A 30 HOUR GAME LIKE MASS EFFECT 3 LOWER ITS RATING FROM 9/10 TO 4/10 OR EVEN LOWER? WTF? Feel free to thumb down but get this shame on u all who claim urselves as ""fans"" but are infact nothing but ragers. Mass Effect 3 is an RPG with the gameplay of an action game. The new combat system is so much fun to play. In ME2 combat becomes a lot less interesting if u choose classes like sentinel that can only use 2 of the 6 weapon types; abilities are also less powerful so soldier is definitely a go-to class. In Mass Effect 3 however not only did EA double the number of weapons from 29 in me2 to 72, the new combo system is also very fun (hitting the same enemy with 2 specific abilities in succession will lead to an explosion dealing tons of dmg). As an RPG ME3 did hell **** job in making combat fun. ME3 takes place after ME2. The reaper has invaded and shepard must again travel around the galaxy to save humanity and other species as well this time. You will meet new friends as well as old, fight the powerful invaders that want nothing but extinction of all sentient species. (Trust me those are not just promotion this game really is that exciting) But in some other aspects, Mass Effect 3 takes a step back. The errand missions (which are the majority of side missions in this game) are boring and does not make any sense, the planet scanning system is removed, and of course the ending. It is seriously pretty disgusting, I must admit, but it is only because it is supposed to be awesome, for Mass Effect 3 is such an anticipated and massive game. It is still better than many, and I must give credit to bioware who tried their best to fix the ending once they realized its problem. At this point whoever that is here either has already played ME3 or is not interested and will probably never play ME. So if you are also a rager go ahead, write a 0/10 review. It just doesn't matter any more. BTW thanks for reading to the end.",9,2014-02-12,PLAYSTATION 3,user

DGDrocks7,"Finally, I have acquired copy of ME3 for Christmas. I was unable to get it for many reasons (mostly because I was skeptic about the ending). So, here we go. In order to reach a wider audience, Bioware made Shepard do most of the talking in order to focus on making the game more action-like. Bioware should have know better than this. And this is where the game loses its one (and only) point. Yet you will still make the major decisions that will greatly affect the story; just the small talk has been automated (though this make the story less personal than the first two games). Don't be fooled, this story MUST be experienced before you die. And your old friends from ME1 and ME2 still have their stories to tell, and this is the game where you finally see how they turn out. The combat mechanics are...well, I don't know. It's not bad, but I really hate the motion blur when you turn. But there is no more fully rechargeable health like in ME2. Your health is divided. If one portion is gone, the only way to replenish it is by using med-gel. Now that's the best of both worlds (why can't many games do this?) There are more varieties of weapons, and the customization is quite deep. Now here is where we get to the most controversial thing about the **** endings. First, DOWNLOAD THE EXTENDED CUT, or you'll get mad. And that's it, you can put your anger to rest. The Extended Cut won't change the endings, but will expand on them. The ending I chose was really emotional, it wrapped up everything, and it was satisfying (thanks to the Extended Cut hehe) Never touched multiplayer yet, but that just a bonus. Besides nobody plays Mass Effect for multiplayer, so why start now? Yes, Shepard will talk most of the time, but you still have the power to direct your story. And as long as you have the Extended Cut, there one of the endings ought to satisfy you. Thank you, Commander Shepard, the galaxy salutes you.",9,2014-01-05,PLAYSTATION 3,user
hostaman,"Woah! Hold on! There seem to be a whole lot of 10 scores and 0 scores for this game implying it's either the best game ever or the worst. It's neither. Most players giving it a big fat zero are doing so because it didn't live up to the high bar set by ME2, and also that they hated the ending. This doesn't make it a terrible game and using this review thread to vent disappointment in this way is inappropriate. So the review: The game is a massive sprawling sci-fi epic, blending RPG elements with shooter game play. For the most part it works very well. The characters are interesting, the story is compelling and the game play is easy enough for noobs and just tough enough for the hardcore gamer. I really enjoyed playing this game and I'm looking forward to ME4, but it's not as good as ME2 and this is where the complainers have a point: The story, character development, RPG elements and the ending in ME2 were all much better. Better story, script, characters and a big set piece ending. ME3 discarded much of the fine work in ME2 for a faster pace which left less room for character, nuance and story in favour of a more accessible game for newcomers. Many suspect this was at the hands of EA, but whatever the reason it does diminish the great work done in ME2. I personally enjoyed the ending, but I understand those that didn't. Bioware raised gamers expectations too high and failed to deliver the story and ending that diehard fans were hoping for. Many of these diehard fans hated the fact that a multiplayer element was added, but it's for this reason that I raised the score from 6 to 8 because the multiplayer game is fantastic. A very simple co-op shooter but so well executed and addictive that I'm still playing it 18 months after the launch!!! Yes it has a few bugs, but name any modern game that doesn't.

Mudville,Im a huge fan of the ME series I've beaten all three games multiple times but if I had to pick my least favorite it would have to be the this one.

This game offers great graphics, storyline and many more mindblowing stuff. The cutscenes are cool. Its the Game of The Year for 2012 for the PS3. Its metascore also should be around 94-96.

ravensfan1996,"This game really does have great gameplay, the main campaign missions are long, challenging, and engaging, and the gunplay is not too difficult. The character development, as we've come to expect from this series, is great, and the side missions all feel like they matter to the larger purpose of the game. However, as fun as the game itself is, factors that are beyond the player's control bring this game down a huge step, the game is touted as being an RPG, but your choices that you make throughout the game have very little effect on the ending to the game. Also, the fact that multiplayer is necessary to get the best ending is absurd, I bought the game used, and was completely enraged when I learned I had to shell out another $15 dollars just to get the best ending, regardless of how well I played the single player campaign. This, and the day 1 DLC make it impossible for this game to receive the score its gameplay earns. But for all its flaws, playing this game was incredibly enjoyable (until the ending), and if you aren't one to care about your ending and just want to play a fun sci-fi shooter, I would absolutely recommend this game.",5,2013-07-27,PLAYSTATION 3,user

If the ending was epic this game would easily been 10/10. The story is about uniting the galaxy and it is presented in an awesome way. The gameplay is vastly improved in me3, combat fast and satisfying, weapon variety is also welcomed. The mutiplayer is very strong with huge amount of depth.

But if you download the Extended Final, and if you can buy the DLC (recommended in my opinion), the game is a masterpiece, and certainly the best of this console generation.

The tension are stakes are ramped up through the game as you see the extent of the Reaper's damage, and levels reflect this. Once again characters are beautifully written, and each moment pays off. Gameplay is smooth and intuitive, it flows well and for once all the powers do something. Multiplayer is also really fun, and the rewards encourage you to play more.

When I first put in the disc, nay when ME3 was first announced, I would have sworn to you that this would be getting my 2012 Game of the Year vote, but sitting pretty here at #4 only shows that this was indeed incredible.

I Liked the idea of having to bring together all the races to fight but then in the final assault you don't actually see any of them. The thing that annoyed me most however was the fact that to get a decent war asset level you needed to play online otherwise your level is terrible. this would of been an annoyance but i bought the game second hand so i had no online pass so i couldn't do this... this resulted in everything in the final assault going up and everyone id ever met on the game dying including Garrus which was the final straw really. Other points are that the squad system is lacking i only had the choice of four, there are no recruitment or loyalty missions. Altogether a huge let down",5,2013-04-10,PLAYSTATION 3,user

There are 2 minute snips of overheard dialogue on the Citadel that carry more emotional weight than 95% of games produced today. If you play games for their story this game simply cannot be matched. If you play games for action there are some very demanding fights and the bellow of the Reapers as they do their best to annihilate you is straight up terrifying.

neoncritic,"Despite having the production heft of a blockbuster action flick, this game feels like a lobotomized, squeaky-clean re-tread. The overall artistic direction is weak and uninspired. This is the worst kind of science fiction. Ripping of huge slabs of Battlestar Galactica, Star Wars and Star Trek, then cobbling them together feels almost shameful. Worst still, the combat controls feel clunky and dated. Why do I have to double-tap jump just to surmount a knee high barrier? Oh, you wanted to run and change direction at the same time? Not in this game you won't. Shocking steps backward for the already awful interplanetary resource collection and the inclusion of a new war room mechanic feel like absurd missteps.

The gameplay is great with fast paced combat and the story is interesting with some great choices to be made throughout the game, It's a good game, The ending was obviously very disappointing for a lot of fans and rightly so, But the Mass Effect Trilogy still has some of the best story and characters of this generation and should not be missed, download the Extended Cut DLC which will soften the blow a bit even though it is still a pretty lackluster ending even with it.",8,2013-03-15,PLAYSTATION 3,user
jackmcready,"As someone who hasn't played the first two games my question was: can I still enjoy Mass Effect 3? The answer is: yes! Sure, ""everyone"" said I would miss out on so much depth and I wouldn't be able to understand all the connections to various characters. To be honest, I didn't care and just took it for what it was. Which is: the universe is threathened by a group called ""the reapers"" and it's up to you to stop them. Simple as that. Whatever I don't understand I just leave it at that, it's not that important. I use my imagination and come up with more or less plausible back stories instead. I haven't finished the game just yet but I feel I'm getting there. I really like how the Mass Effect universe feels like. I like travelling between stars and planets and I like the missions. There's not too much of the ""do this 100 times"" missions, which usually are common i RPG:s. I will keep this review short and just add one more thing. The choices you make and how they affect the outcome. Since I haven't even finished the game once I can't say how much my choices really affects the game, but what's relevant is that I FEEL like my choices matter. It's all I could ask for. However I get the feeling that some choices I made early on was more important than the ones I've made more recently. And finally, the multiplayer (survival mode) is really enjoyable. At least when you play with friends.",8,2013-03-14,PLAYSTATION 3,user
Gargus,"I'm not here to rip on ME3 just for the sake of doing so or because its what's cool to do on the internet like so many others. Basically ME3 is the worst of the series in every way possible compared to the other 2 games because it doesn't build or improve anything. It simply just tries to hurriedly finish the series for the sake of a cash in on the title. 1- There is no sense of exploration. The game as efficiently as possible holds your hand every step the way and has you actually being on the ground doing things the least amount possible. Side missions are carried out by quickly scanning a planet ala ME2 and then firing a probe. That's it. You don't explore, you don't get to check out uncharted worlds simply for the sake of curiosity or anything. Scan, shoot probe, side mission done all without even leaving the galaxy map. This tactic accounts for the majority of side missions. ME1 you could explore the galaxy drive around in that horribly handling buggy and had a sense of discovering things, ME2 you could land on planets and explore doing side missions with some not even firing a single shot like the crashed cruiser balanced on the mountain peak but all of those things are gone in 3. The game just holds your hand and ushers you from mission to mission. 2- You don't get to actually chose anything, everything is pre determined for you. Even if you chose the renegade or paragon path you get the exact same result and no one treats you differently and you get no alternative paths depending on your karma scale which makes it all incredibly pointless and just window dressing for the fact the story is entirely linear and so is your character. 3- The characters are all the same ones, only less compelling. There are a couple new characters but they are highly disposable and not even worth messing with. James for instance is basically just a guy who talks 90% of the time like a generic white guy, 10% of the time he throws out some Mexican phrases like saying ""loco"" a lot in his generic white guy trying to impersonate a Mexican guy and he looks like he was taken from the show jersey shore. When a old character returns you can see it coming a mile away. For instance you go into a area where the mission briefing talks about geth then you can see 45 minutes before which old character is going to come back. All the characters themselves seem hollow and rushed, they lack the personality that made them endearing in the other games and most are there only long enough to be overly obvious in a very specific mission or they simply show up for 3 minutes of camera time practically winking at the player with a nod and then are gone. 4- The story compared to the others ****. The other games had side stories, character stories, side missions with their own short stories and so on. ME3 on the other is basically this ""Everything is going to be destroyed"". That's pretty much it because no matter where you go or what you do its always about the war specifically and nothing else. I also got sick of hearing phrases like ""were here to save lives"", ""were doing this to save lives"", ""this weapon will save lives"", ""we need to stick together to save lives"", ""billions of lives are on the line and were here to save them"", etc and after about 8 hours I was sick of hearing about the war and saving lives. 5- The game play was basically just one big shooting gallery and hiding behind chest high walls. Every single fight is basically you hiding behind chest high walls to peak out and fire a few rounds only to hide back behind said wall. It was incredibly boring and has been done to death in dozens of other games. The combat was mindless and mediocre. It felt like they put absolutely no effort into the combat at all and rushed you through it in order to get to the next scene of hearing Sheppard say ""saving lives"". 6- The ending was atrocious. This is a series that prides itself on story, characters and dialogue. We all spent over 100 bucks playing all 3 games and spent over 100 hours playing all 3 games but bioware seemed to say ""This is the end of the trilogy so who cares about the ending"". The ending is the most important part of any story of any kind because its the very last thing you leave the person with and its supposed to be a reward, the climax to everything leading up till then, basically the ending is the most important part of any story. But the ending of ME3 was over in just a minute or so despite the dozens of hours of dialogue, cut scenes and story in the rest of the series they got lazy at the end. It gives no satisfaction at all. I can honestly say it is the laziest segment of the series. I did like though they had the balls to do what they did with Sheppard, but the ending still **** and doesn't make you glad to have finished the series.",1,2013-03-07,PLAYSTATION 3,user

Go watch any of Julian Kluk's thoughtful documentaries on YouTube or ****; he has 4 1/2 hours of footage supporting it, and it's incredibly convincing and makes disbelieving the Theory more illogical and ignorant than ANY ""wrong"" endings critics think Bioware made.

ME 2 was sometimes getting boring because there wasn't a lot of guns. Here you have more than thirty guns and each gun class has class mods! Its more fun to create gun based on your playstyle. The combat is a HUGE improvement. When I played ME 2 I felt like a robot on a battlefield that was all stiff and moved like a dummy.

Now to the story...this is the core of Mass Effect. Mass Effect 3 delivers as one of the best sci-fi games of all time. Along with one of the best trilogy's of all time. It is truly a epic, emotional blast to go through. The ending to Mass Effect 3 mixed some confusion but as my opinion i believe Bioware has fixed it with Extended Cut. Which is free to download.

DanMaster,"It makes me sad to see so many haters. So what if Bioware didn't make a perfect game like we were all expecting? Yes Mass effect 3 has flaws, like a terrible ending to a beloved trilogy. But it has given us much more: hours and hours of gameplay, acción/RPG gameplay, stellar Voice acting/ script, tons of side missions and exploring, lovable/likable/crappy characters, beautiful worlds and lore, dinamic battle system with different classes that totally change the way we play as Shepard, female and male Shepard ( how many games do that). I could go on and on, writing pages about what's to love about mass effect 3, but I guess we all know that. Bioware tried they gave us ""Extended Cut"" DLC, so yes The Finale was a HUGE dissapointment but we can't turn our back or our heart to the whole trilogy. Once in a lifetime does a Trilogy end like it should, only Back to the Future and Star Wars Return of the Jedi did it right. Matrix 3, Robocop 3, Lord of the Rings 3, all failed. Mass Effect 3 was a bittersweet end to an Epic and memorable Trilogy, perfection is hard to reach in this modern day competitive world and Mass Effect came so close. They set the bar really High with ME 1 and ME2. Thanks for trying Bioware,you succeded in creating a pop world social sensation.",9,2012-10-09,PLAYSTATION 3,user
nemesis0288,"Overall, this game delivers most of what it promised. This game (and series, for that matter) offers one of the greatest experiences in terms of story and character development. There were two moments in the game where I literally found myself crying. Yes, the ending was a bit of a disappointment and didn't necessarily offer the closure I was hoping for, but every moment leading up to that ending was nothing short of brilliant. I almost never give perfect scores to games, but, had the ending been a bit more satisfying, this game would have received a 10 in my book.",9,2012-10-06,PLAYSTATION 3,user

Gureamu,"I assumed the internet was overreacting about the ending. However, after investing so much time and emotion into the series, I did end up feeling I deserved something better. However, up until the end, it is an incredible game - full of amazing moments and fantastic ideas. From the epic background action of the first missions to the innovative sonic ideas in the final push, I was frequently just saying ""wow"" and being completely blown away. The multi-player is solid and fun, but I didn't think it was necessary - and I slightly resented being forced to play it to influence the single-player game. Anyway, basically, it's a very, very good game that could have been 10/10 if it wasn't for the slightly fumbled ending.",8,2012-09-29,PLAYSTATION 3,user
Marmalade,"I honestly don't know WHAT to rate this game, because the first 99% of the game was mostly great, with the exception of a few things I'll get into. Don't hate me, but I love, LOVE the multiplayer aspect of the game (even though in principle I know I shouldn't, because it likely took away from the development of core aspects of the single player game, but I'm just going to be honest here). Though I admit that after three or four play-throughs the multiplayer can get boring and repetitive, I don't do it every day and I enjoy just being able to go in and shoot stuff with other players when the mood strikes me (as long as they're not some nerd with a headset who screams at everyone in the group - that's when I leave and requeue). That being said, I DON'T like how multiplayer ties into the single player aspect of the game with the whole Galactic Readiness crap and how your GR degrades every few hours if you don't grind through dozens of multiplayer games. I like playing a few sessions of multiplayer now and then, but I don't like HAVING to play it because it will affect the outcome of my single-player campaign (because there are SO many outcomes...right? ;) Cupcakes anyone?). This was a horrible idea on Bioware's part, because it forces the player to grind battlegrounds in multiplayer to the point where it gets boring and tedious - I'd rather play it when I want and not feel compelled to. Another problem I have with the game is the lack of depth of my relationships with my companions. I didn't feel as connected to my companions as I did in other Bioware games - I think they did a better job in DAO and SWTOR in that you actively fostered relationships with your companions, which unlocked more conversation options. I know this isn't as big of a part of the ME franchise, but my relationships in the first ME felt deeper and more involved. I also hated that I had to pay an extra $10 to get the Prothean as a part of the story - something that should have been included in the game, not day 1 DLC. I bought it anyway, because I wanted the full experience and after the fact I feel that the story of ME3 would have been less complex without him - but I WILL NOT be buying any future DLC for this game in the future. Ever. After experiencing the boatload of epic fail that was the ending - I won't invest my money or time in another Bioware game in the future. The story had so much build-up, so much drama, and so much choice - only to be screwed in the end by some random star child that was introduced in the last 10 minutes of the game who gave you three choices that all ended up causing a literary dissonance in the context of the series and made every choice you made mean nothing. Yes, I hated the ending. I actually watched the (three) endings before I actually played through the game, because I read a lot about how much uproar they caused. I'd never played the ME series before, so I took the time to go through the series to see if the ending made any sense in the context of the series - and no, it didn't. The writing of the ending was sloppy, and even with the ""extended cut"" it was still the same ending and haphazard writing - it just gave a false sense of closure. I won't rate the game 0 because there were so many great moments in the game - but the ending completely screwed everything it built up to, and the blatant false advertising of this game NOT having ""Choice A, B or C"" as an ending has made me lose all faith in Bioware as a company (though let's face it - they're EA now and not Bioware anymore, which is sad because they used to put out high quality games that engaged me as a player, inspired me and blew my freakin' mind). I'll still play multiplayer every now and then, and I'll make up my own ending in my own head, which I feel is just as valid (if not more) than the crap we were given.",3,2012-09-29,PLAYSTATION 3,user

Watermelon789,"The most controversial game for whether the disappointing ending or the satisfying finale . I can't argue more the ending by their different views but what is behind the full package is a worthy trip . The game-play feels like a normal shooter , with a very fluid combat system , better melee feel and the violent sounds of the guns that doesn't sound like the typical * peew * * peew * of franchises like Star Wars . Graphically seems more superior than the previous entry and it offers a more intense story-line thanks to the overused Reaper name in the last episodes . The added cut-scenes only brings a little more detail in what happened in certain parts but it isn't something that will blow your **** off . With the multiplayer dominating this videogame landscapes, ME3 doesn't get behind either but don't expect to be better than other shooters , is simply odd and weird for a RPG game .

Despite what other people say, this is really a game for Bioware to be proud of, I'm going to stay loyal to this series, they tried new things, and thats what they need to do, some people just cant stand changes or new thing, Deal with it, the time is still ticking, and you cannot expect company's to stop experimenting on new features. I really saw the game tech evolve into something more nice and powerful, and it apparently did because i got blown away by not only the story, but also by the awesome effects, the awesome game play, and the awesome, voice acting! In short this i a must have, you need to like that the games will *Evolve* to be able get more and more awesome then it is now. If you don't like new stuff, sorry but then your really out dated.. The added the extended cut to make you able to make more choices, and they did, so stop whining, or ****. 10/10 Cant wait for the next related game! @ bioware: Great job, i'm still a fan, and i always will, just ignore the whining people, think the ending ****, that makes it a invalid statement, because you really make be cry, and I'm not even kidding..",10,2012-09-05,PLAYSTATION 3,user

Killision,"THERE ARE NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW OR ANY ENDING GRIPES Mass Effect 3 is not as advertised. It fails for a few reasons. Firstly it is advertised as an RPG. The truth is that this is a on rails shooter that offers no way to deviate and do things on your own like in the previous two installments. Leveling up does not hold any real benefit like it does in other RPG 's. You don't actually learn any new abilities or powers (leveling sniper rifle in ME1 so you can actually aim better as an example). Weapons are all very lethal right from the beginning so the game is pretty easy to beat. As far as the game play goes, it is a good third person shooter but brings nothing exceptional or memorable to the genre. The locals in the game would be much more interseting if the were not so linear. Levels in Mass Effect 3 are essentially a series of waves of enemies and corridors that you are funneled down. Not every level but it it makes the ones that are, that much more boring to play. Difficulty make the enemies absorb more bullets/powers and does not make them any smarter. The AI still runs at your bullets. As far as story goes, it follows a very tired formula of ""Hero with back against the wall"" combined with ""thank god for the whatever device"" to conclude the trilogy in a very cliched fashion. Many titles have done this (Gears of War 3 as an example) and with each ""new"" title that does this, the genre is diluted a little further. The game feels like it's trying to play it safe by providing a narrative that has been successful in the past in other sci-fi games. This game does offer moments that are fantastic if you have been a fan from the beginning, however Mass Effect 3 is very unfriendly to new players as they will have zero idea of whats happening in the story arc. The advertising is once again misleading in this regard. If you have not played the previous installments, the decisions you are asked to make will make no sense and have no real weight. PC SPECIFIC: I've played this game on the PC and 360 , and I can say that there is no real advantage to owning this game on the PC over console. There is a lack of PC specific support such as XBOX 360 game pad support (some people want to play that way) and remapping keys on the PC you are still left with one key to take care of most actions. The graphics are sub standard as far as a pc game is concerned. Curiously the graphics in Mass Effect 2 on the PC where better that Mass Effect 3. There are also times when the game crashes for no reason and happens at different moments on different playthroughs.",5,2012-09-02,PLAYSTATION 3,user

EnigmaReviews,"Well one of the best gaming series ever has come to an end. When I first got my hands on the game I immediatly notices differences from the second game. The first of course is the graphics. Although they don't compare to the those of Uncharted, Gears of War, and Crysis they are still good in their own way. The next thing I noticed is new animations. This is good because in a lot of sequels devs will recycle the same animation. I got to the story and it was extremely good no suprise there. The gameplay was great, weapons where awesome, and the characters where likeable. The multiplayer isn't that great to be honest. It seem like something they tacked on to add more to the game. Although the free DLC is a bonus it isn't much of a plus. Now here comes the ending drama. (Please note that I am writng this review after the extended cut dlc). This part of the game has gathered a lot of negative feedback. The ending by far was good. The main thing I have a problem with is what Bioware promised. The ending didn't have much variety in them. Also your decisions really don't have zero effect on the ending as well which is a huge let down. Overall this is an amazing game but if you where a fan from the begining them you will feel disapointed at the end. That doesn't take away from the game though. It does so much good that it heavily out weighs the bad. Mass Effect 3 is a 9/10 if they would have got the ending right it would have been a master piece.",9,2012-07-24,PLAYSTATION 3,user
TheWhymsicalOne,"This game had tons of hype to live up to. After the astounding experience that was Mass Effect 2, Bioware was tasked with making a final game that would knock everyone's socks off. And it came so close. For newcomers to the Mass Effect franchise, the year is 2183, and you play as Commander Shepard, a soldier getting ready to lead the galaxy in a fight against a race of super-machines known as the Reapers, who harvest all advanced civilizations every 50,000 years. Your decisions from Mass Effect 2 will carry over, so I suggest you get that first, as it is a slightly better game. Where this game is strong is gameplay. The shooter element has been revamped, with new movements in and out of cover, more ladders and the ability to jump off short drops. This does add a bit of smoothness to the gameplay, especially the cover movement. Another part of gameplay is the dialogue, where you select your answer using the left analog stick. In this it felt.... A bit less natural. In Mass Effect 2 it felt so much more organic with random options, while in this game there was a lot of just ""Good/Bad/Details"" choices. But Mass Effect 2 is a very high standard to compare it to, so Mass Effect 3 still trumps most other games. It's good technically. Graphics are good if not the best, although I felt the characters faces were not as expressive as they should have been, except in some scenes. The Voice acting is of good quality. And the soundtrack is amazing. Some of the games most emotional moments are backed up by breathtakingly chilling music. And the storyline is fantastic. It follows a more linear pattern than Mass Effect 2, which gives it more of a base to have a good story. Decisions from the previous games are also factored in. The relationships with characters are sacrificed for a plot that delivers epic twists and turns all the way up to the last 10 minutes. Where it falls flat on it's face. It takes away individual choices, which were massively difficult to make, and instead gives them scores, sticks them into a group called ""War Assets"" and gives you an ending based on it. And the endings aren't even that different. People who've followed the franchise before this game will be severely disappointed. This game is great. It combines a great story and a fantastic decision making system with a quality third-person shooter setup. But compared to it's predecessor, it's a little more linear. And the ending will not make you happy. I'd recommend this to anyone, just as long as you turn it off after the Illusive Man dies.",8,2012-07-16,PLAYSTATION 3,user
cphi,"Woah. Have just completed the best game I've ever played. (I didn't anything would take the title from the circa 1994 System Shock). An evolutionary progression that somehow results in a game a generation on from anything else I've played. Emotionally engaging in a way few films or books and even fewer games manage. Gameplay mechanics are both harder and vastly improved on ME2's (which were almost embarrassingly bad) and have evolved into a rock solid shooter, while keeping the same richness of story. The narrative is much tighter than ME2's and can feel more limited but the trade off is some truly amazing substories. The ending is a little 'thin' but is interesting enough and can hardly be described as 'disappointing'.",10,2012-07-14,PLAYSTATION 3,user
Jacktheripper99,"Many people criticize the ending, which really wasn't the main issue for me. The game-play, which from ME1 - ME3 has always been the problem for me, and the main reason why I stay, was because of the story. The enemy AI has always been meh, and ME3 is no different. They claim they improve it, but all I see is UC 2.0 meaning, more enemies on the field spawning, and pinning you down and throwing perfectly arc grenade at you. Doesn't sound exciting or generally fair doesn't it? The squad AI is still stupid, but there no point in talking about something Bioware clearly think is okay. Plant scanning is still present, which I don't like, but they made it more bearable than ME2, which was ridiculously long, and time consuming, which is the point. ME3 isn't a long game outside investigating questions, new plant scanning system, obnoxious time consuming things in the game, like the scanning from the war room, stuff like that. The story is still great, and with the new extended cut, which wasn't really needed, sense they kept the same endings, and I just overall feel happy I stay with the series till the end, even though I don't like the game-play. The endings is what it is, and like movies, I just accepted it for what it is. It's good, its good, it's bad, it's bad. Overall ME3 is a okay game, but the praise that the series has been getting with all these present issues, mainly the game-play, makes me wonder where these people who rate this game so high, are coming from?

Drakko89,"Mass Effect 3 is an above average game. They've tweaked the game play, kept the same high caliber music and the story is above average. Without going into too many details, Commander Shepard is facing off against the reapers who plan on wiping out most sentient life in the universe. It's not the best game in the universe but I enjoyed it. You may disagree with the ending but you can't argue that the events leading up to it aren't at least pretty good. As for decisions not having immediate or significant impact: the games take place within a small time frame (2-3 years?). How do you expect to see the effects of those decisions within such a small time frame? If they make a follow up within the mass effect universe, it will probably take place a few hundred years after Mass Effect 3. There is no way this game deserves less than a 6 and users that have given it less than that because Bioware didn't make it exactly the way they wanted it are incredibly stupid. I wish I had been able to recruit my ME 2 squad mates, that they had included more neutral options in the dialogue, included more side missions and most importantly, hadn't spent so much time trying to cater to new gamers to the franchise(to name a few things) but I can still say that the game is very good.

chujfugh,"I am not going to talk about the ending, because that doesn't matter. I'll just say one thing: First impressions are everything. I rented the game, and played at least 10 hours of it. It was boring. I didn't think it was worth it. The cover-based shooting mechanics were bland, and compared to Uncharted 3, ME3 was a load of old ****. But, it's not a shooter, it's an RPG, so how is that doing? Well, too many cutscenes. I. Hate. Cutscenes. You should be able to tell a story without interrupting gameplay, that's how the whole 'game' thing works, you have to weave exposition into the narrative, not hand the audience a **** glossary as they walk in. The conversation thing works pretty well, it has some good writing, and the character customization is hilarious, but you can get all this in the demo. I highly recommend getting the demo instead of the game itself. I'm not one of those twitching, instant-gratification gamers who are never satisfied if they haven't killed anything in 5 seconds, I love 'games are art' games, but ME3 just feels unpolished as RPG, I would also recommend Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning over this (though I do hate EA) or even Fallout 3 over this. The best WRPG I've played is either Fallout 3 or Skyrim, so take your pick instead of this one. I'm a new-comer to the series, this was the first time I've played a Mass Effect game, so whether this is inviting to new-comers is up for debate. EA released an unfinished game, and released the rest of the game, the full version of it, as day-one DLC. Think about that. EA went to far with it, they tried to **** our wallets as much as they could, and since I hate the EA marketing department (how they marketed Dante's Inferno and Dead Space 2 was despicable) and the **** company in general, this deserves all the hate it gets.",4,2012-06-07,PLAYSTATION 3,user

Veteran_Gamer,"I've been a gamer since they first came out, and I have seldom seen such butchery done to a great series such as Mass Effect. It's almost as if the Folk at BioWare and EA wanted to commit financial suicide here. The loyal Customers are pissed, disappointed in the extreme, and... something I've rarely seen done...actually campaigning to have the game FIXED! If $ was the objective of all these gimmicks involving DLCs, and the like; then I'd say it has back-fired on them. All too many people like me, simply will not buy the game until they see it wallowing in the ""has-been"" bin at WalMart for $5 dollars. Way to go on ruining a great series, burning your Customers, and destroying your own reputation.",1,2012-06-02,PLAYSTATION 3,user

Corey77,"The excellent build up set by Mass effect 1 and 2 was ruined in what could of been the game of the year. Mass Effect 3 has some improvements combat wise over the previous instalments but fails to deliver in any other areas. In Mass Effect 3 there is now a single hub world full of small little fetch quests, there is less Dialogue between your crew, Less crew members and more auto-dialogue which really takes away from the experience. All your choices from the previous games that were suppose to drastically effect Mass effect 3 all boiled down to a similar experience. The game cuts corners on many aspects such as your love interest for example and a missing link between Mass effect 2 and 3. But put all it's flaws aside there are some excellent emotional mission sequences that largely finalised and tied up the side plots mass effect 2 created and these were absolutely brilliant and are fascinating, exhilaration and emotion provoking. The combat is even more fluent and it is still a very enjoyable experience but in the end Mass effect 3 was to decide how it all ended and if it's ending was amazing and previously listed faults could have been ignored, except it wasn't it was awful, never before have I cam across an ending that ruined an entire series and basically put me off gaming for a while altogether, everything was thrown out the window in a nonsensical ending riddled with plotholes and loose ends. leaving the player confused and depressed. All in all it still has the redeeming qualities that all mass effect games have, it's just the game itself was rushed and really poor in many areas.",7,2012-05-29,PLAYSTATION 3,user

Hybridiction,"This is the score the game actually deserves. Now before you down-vote me, you will find if you average around the fifty + critic scores the game received it would be around the 89-93 area. Take off the moronic user score feature metacritic, it is used as a tool by a bunch of forum trolls and butthurt fanboys who really have no clue how to review a game. Of course this review will be down-voted by them, and I'll probably be called a ""**** up"" to the gaming media, but let's look at the facts first. High expectations almost always lead to disappointment, and those who have insanely high expectations will always be disappointed. This is why when you look at a game objectively, or rather as it is, instead of what you wanted it to be, you would find that it truly is a good game. Whether you disagreed with the ending or had problems because you ""Felt"" that the choices you made in the previous installments weren't reflected enough, it really doesn't matter. It's no reason to give this game a score below 7, and the fact that this game is rated a 3.9 is really quite pathetic. To even think that this game is only worth a ""3.9"" you would have to be some grumpy old man living in some old folks home or some kid who stays in his room all day, has no friends and doesn't know how to enjoy quality entertainment. The decisions you made in the previous games do reflect in this one, and yes they matter. Characters that die in ME2 wont be around, characters you saved in ME1 do make an appearance and yes your choices DID have reflect in ME3. Name a game that carries the choices you made from game to game on the same level mass effect has? You cant, there is only stand alone games with choices like the witcher 2, but what game from sequel to sequel to sequel does what the ME series has?. The fact people cry because they feel that their choices never meant anything is LAUGHABLE seeing as how they have nothing to compare it to. Give mass effect some credit, it has done a pretty damned good job. The ending to the series is fine, and honestly it really doesn't matter what bioware did people would have cried and crapped their pants. Everybody has a different idea of how it should have ""ended"" Bioware cant possibly meet everybody's expectations. The gameplay was much improved from the previous two, they added in some more RPG elements, still not as robust as ME1 but pretty close with the talent choices, weapon mods and tons of armor and loot to find. Mass effect 3 is a good game that sold well and that the majority of people enjoyed playing, don't listen to the vocal minority of idiots on here who probably pirated the game or never even played it at all and are just jumping on the hate bandwagon to hate the game like it's some ""fad"" to do so or makes them ""cool and different"" ****, sit down and enjoy the game.

Tokyochuchu,"Mass Effect 3 has some notable bumps on it's road; It has limited freedom when compared to it's predecessors, some technical instabilities (mostly glitches & framerate issues) and a confusingly muddled ending that has stirred up a hornet's nest of internet trolls. That said, these are all moot points in the face of what Mass Effect 3 delivers to the player, which is the best Sci-Fi action game ever made. The things you get to see and experience in ME3 are totally amazing! There are so many unforgettable moments to be had. The plot is excellent and the script keeps the emotional connections fixed in the spotlight. The result is an action game with a true sense of meaning and consequence. The afore mentioned ending is both blunt and strange, but it's mystery's beg for debate just like all classic Sci-Fi should (2001: A space Odyssey springs to mind). Mass Effect 3 is a series high and one of the best games I have ever played in my 20+ years of gaming.",10,2012-05-15,PLAYSTATION 3,user

What I will comment on however, pertains to one of the best titles I've yet to encounter in my 30 years of gaming.. period. For those familiar the series, ME isn't a game, it's an experience unlike anything out there. Yes, high praise should go out to titles like GTA4, MGS4 and RED Dead, but in terms of a series, (and I rarely use this word).. Epic best sums up what you should expect from the final chapter with Shepard and crew. It's as close to perfect as perfect gets and even if you've yet to touch the franchise, you owe it to yourself to pick up this title today. (I'd also highly recommend playing the first instalments if possible) as the story will carry much more weight in doing so. In a world where the single player campaign and story is being overlooked by the ADD multiplayer shooters, Mass Effect 3 is marvellous and is up the in my top 10 games of all time.

Rosco,"First of all, I would say that Mass Effect 2 isn't just the greatest RPG ever to grace the console but it's arguably the greatest game ever made. It delivered such a compelling, deep, rich, atmospheric experience that continues to live long in the memory. So my expectations where probabaly over ambitious for the third outing. And after playing the game over and over again, devoted hours of life I can understand the disapproval the game has gathered but would definetly say that Mass Effect 3 is by no means a game worthy of a '0.' Picking up from where the ME2 DLC Arrival left off, ME3 see's Shepard relieved of his duties as the consequences of his actions during the DLC, whilst on Earth the Reapers have launched an overwhelming onslaught leading Admiral Anderson to set Shepard the mission of uniting the galaxy's forces. Ofcourse the gameplay unfolds from here and you are able to import your saved data meaning that anyone who didn't make it from ME1&2 won't be in ME3. However, an early discovery is made after saving Liara, where she reveals that there is a potential weapon capable of destroying the Reapers; The Crucible. From here that's what it's all about. Travelling across the galaxy uniting forces whilst making major decisions along the way regarding the future of the Krogan race, the Geth and Quarians, aswell as taking care of personal loose ends including romantic options where you can decide who Shepard finally ends up with. Cerberus are also heavily involved under the guidance of The Illusive Man (TIM) who believes the Reapers should be controlled and not destroyed and throughout you have to deal with their attempts to take the Citadel as well as mounting an attack on their headquarters as a starting point towards the final battle. Your decisions along the way as you will already know are important in determining the ending to the game however even more vital is Effective Military Strength (EMS) which has a huge impact in final outcome of your Shepard's journey, this is mainly gained through online play. Regardless of who you sacrifice or save it all leads down to Citadel where a battered and blooded Shepard faces a final showdown with TIM,ultimately resulting in an old friends death, before all is finally revealed and the fate of the galaxy sealed. Lets just say you are in for rude awakening if you thought every decision you had to make was going to be crucial in determining how Mass Effect 3 ends. As you are transported to the pinnacle of the Citadel, the Catalyst approaches you in the shape of the young boy who dies at the start of the game who explains everything. Unfortunately the explanation isn't anything i could have possibly imagined but nonetheless he reveals that the Reaper cycle is an attempt to prevent organic life from wiping itself out by creating synthetic life leading you to face three options; 'Destroy,' 'Control,' or 'Convert.' All three result in the apparent death of Shepard however if you choose 'Destroy' and have the correct amount of EMS you can gain the 'perfect' ending where it shows a potentially alive Shepard breathing amongst the ruins of the destruction which results in the mass relays being destroyed and the Normandy ending up stranded on another planet... then after the credits have rolled an old man is shown with a young boy, who asks the elderly gent to tell him more stories about 'the Shepard' implying that Shepard's legend lives on. We all know the controversy regarding the ending and initially I felt as though I had been well and truly conned as all the assurances BioWare has given simply weren't on show. But after taking my time going through things again I'm not as bummed as I first was. The gameplay is awesome. It was always going to be the introduction of new weapons is cool and the shooting system worked superbly well in ME2 so only a few minor tweaks were needed in that department so I didn't have any complains there. The Normandy was fine although you don't get enough of it. Graphically it's not exactly a blockbuster movie. There are annoying glitches along the way but they don't prevent you from playing on, they just frustrate you at times. The plot. Well not so much the story as the ending(s). Let's face it BioWare sold us all short big time! Shepard dying doesn't bother me as much as others, sure it would've been great for him to get that happily ever after but it's the fact they have disregarded everything a player has gone through and delivered such a pointless and worthless ending that a trilogy such as Mass Effect doesn't deserve. Multiplayer was unnecessary but I was relatively impressed but not addicted to it as other games, but is a vital component for those of us seeking that 'perfect' ending. Simply, ME3 is a tremendous game with a terrible ending and as a result is one of the biggest disappointments to date. I await the extended epilogue in the hope of some REAL closure",8,2012-05-10,PLAYSTATION 3,user

While its not my favourite game in the series, it is certainly worth a play through if you've managed the other games.

DefeatTheSerum,"First let me start off by saying that despite the controversy, Mass Effect 3 is an amazing game. It is true that In some fields it does come up short when compared to it's predecessors (ie. Side-quests) but it also not only matches but excels past the first two games in other fields such as voice acting, plot coherency, character development, and the ability to draw out real emotion from it's audience. In terms of gameplay I don't think many would argue that it has far surpassed the second game in terms of tight, fluid shooting mechanics and has surged light-years past the original. While RPG elements in terms of ability and class customization in both the second and third installments are lacking when compared to the first game, ME3 seems to find a good balance of taking the streamlined elements of the second game and enhancing them to more closely resemble that of the first game (ie. Branching ability paths, weapon customization, and armor customization). One of the larger gripes among critics of the game is that autodialogue is more present in the third game. And this is true. While some saw this as a step back in terms of interactive storytelling I personally saw it as a way to allow the story to flow a bit more smoothly in conversation (my personal opinion of course), that's not to say that you won't still be able to make your own choices throughout the game. You will, but you will also see your Shepard speak more on his/her own. It is enjoyable to see (again, despite popular belief) many of your choices from the previous two games affect the story as you progress THROUGH the game, which brings me to the part of the game that many feel is a deal-breaker. While the game as a larger whole is affected by what you did in the previous two games it is hard to argue that choices you made throughout the series affect the ending in any real way (other than the amount of war assets you accumulate), although BioWare has announced they plan to rectify this in their upcoming ""Extended Cut"" DLC (free of charge). While I may not be one of the people who seem to have made it their mission to hate the ending in any outlet they can find, I do have to admit the ending is weak. Gamebreakingly weak? Absolutely not. But it is weak. All of that's not touching on multiplayer which is a fun, ableit repetitive distraction. So all in all Mass Effect 3 and the Mass Effect series in general is without a doubt a gaming triumph worthy of having a look at by anyone who enjoys the gaming medium, or anyone who is looking for an overall rich and immersive gaming experience.",9,2012-04-23,PLAYSTATION 3,user
w_underwood,"I just don't know what to think of this game. I was hoping to play a game that would leave me impressed when it was over but I was not impressed at all nor really enthusiastic to finish it. So many parts in this game had the potential to be worth the price but most fell short and I was disappointed in finding myself watching a cut scene instead of playing it out myself. By the way, I don't remember having seen so many cutscenes in the first two games. This game is apparently the best way they could end a series that had so much potential. I find it kind of hard to believe this was the best Bioware along with EA's support could do.",6,2012-04-22,PLAYSTATION 3,user
acisawesome,"Ah yes ""Mass Effect is an awful game series"", I have dismissed that claim. ME3 brings in quite a few innovations to the table since ME2, and I think that it brings in almost all of your major choices from previous games amazingly. The combat is quite similar to the untrained eye, and, even though that would be a good thing anyway (ME2's combat system was sublime) it's not true. Combat it ME3 is much more brutal, difficult and it forces you to make use of its environments (which are a much more 3-dimensional setting than previous games. One mission in it particular forces you to pull out every trick you have in an attempt to survive long enough to finish (immensely difficult on insanity). The combat it also much more cinematic, being able to pull enemies over cover near you at either stab them, crush them, or a variety of other things much to my humor. The story (ending excluded, is one of, if not the best writing in games I have ever played, pulling at emotional heart strings, but with enough witty dialogue to keep it from being depressing. In response to the ending controversy, is the ending good, god no, does it makes sense, again no, but does it ruin the entire series, or even the game? No, do you know what I did when I finished ME3? I sat down and played it again. Then I went out and bought the ""From Ashes"" DLC, (not necessary, but I would recommend it, it adds to the story and adds some interesting dialogue) got that onto the game, but I didn't play it as soon as I got that. I went back the ME1 comic and started the whole series again (that's about 40 hours a game, 50 if your going for everything like I was). And I still loved the journey as Commander Shepard, even though the ending was lack luster. The multiplayer is surprisingly good, and I found myself surprised at how much I was enjoying it, though it is harder than the single player campaign, and with the free ""Resensurgence"" DLC that was released earlier, its only getting better, the only fault is it doesn't show your total play time, but I can forgive that. So, in the end Mass Effect 3 is a modern triumph in games, with some faults (ending, and loss of SOME dialogue options (though you still retain most of them)). Take this review from a fan who has put over a thousand hours into Mass Effect, over a thousand hours into EACH Mass Effect and that isn't including the multiplayer, this game is great, perfect? No, but still a modern miracle in the gaming. As a side note, all of these awful reviews (the 0, and 1's) are from fans who feel cheated by the ending, and are so angry that they cant see that the journey there is magnificent. Some of them are right about it, but they have far to harshly judged it. e.g. the ending is awful, I can never play Mass Effect again 0/10; which I proved wasn't always true in this review. All I can do now is urge you to buy this game (and the others as well, they make it better, especially if you choose save a guy called Wrex from the first game, his dialogue is amazing)",10,2012-04-21,PLAYSTATION 3,user
ZexenVatenkeist,"The conclusion of the epic sci-fi + shooter + RPG trilogy, there was a lot of hype and pressure surrounding the release of Mass Effect 3. And from the very start, it is obvious Bioware was not afraid to be bold: the game kicks off with a heavy dose of story, action and Reaper destruction. From there, it falls to you to travel through the galaxy building up an army for the counter-attack on Earth; and trying to solve all interplanetary political conflicts in the meantime. This is very well done, and progression is smooth and maintains the same level of tension through the whole game. Graphics are amazing (albeit a bit buggy at times), with Reapers on the background ravaging almost every planet you visit. Dialogue is well-built and the voice acting is great. Gameplay remains almost the same, which is also great. Playing the game on harder difficulty levels is a much bigger challenge than in the previous installments, as most combat areas are circular and you are constantly flanked; a good thing for those who, like me, found Mass Effect 2 a bit too easy. The only flaw in Mass Effect 3 is the end. It is not as terrible as you might have heard, but it is confusing, has many plot holes and simply discards all the morality choices you made through the whole series: you may be the most terrible Renegade who ever lived and still choose the Paragon finale. Despite this serious flaw Mass Effect 3 is still a great game and a fitting end to an epic trilogy altogether.",9,2012-04-19,PLAYSTATION 3,user

Bheg,"First, I want to warn you who didn't play this game, that it is not a good movement to trust the user reviews (and I will include myself in this). This is because this game is so controversial, that have made a lot of people enrage about it. This people, which didn't like the ending of the game, and therefore the ending of the franchise, are so frustrated that will easily give this title a 0/10 just because of its ending, which represents just the last minute of gameplay. In my opinion, this is very unfair, and can lead people to believe this game is actually bad, when it isn't. In fact, this game is probably one of the bests RPG you will have this year. Graphics: 9/10. With better graphics than its predecessors, ME3 meets perfectly what its expected for a science-fiction title of this generation. Sound: 9/10. This game will probably make you care about the music. Some of the songs really fit the critical moments, making them even more epic and memorable. Of course and as expected, Bioware also made a brilliant work dubbing the game. Gameplay: 10/10. If you though ME was a brilliant mixture of RPG and shooter playstyle, then you will simply love ME3, being even more dynamic and intuitive than its predecesors. The cover system will make u enrage sometimes, but you will be having so much fun that you will easily forget about this. As a negative, ME3 has more ""autodialog"" than previous bioware titles, which makes you get less involved in conversations, but don't worry, you will still be able to make pretty big choices through the game. Oh and good news for naughty players, ME3 allows same-sex romances, yum! Also, there's a quite addictive multiplayer mode. Story: 8/10. ME3 feels more linear than its predecessors, and it is. It also has less secondary missions and the main quest is probably shorter. Story is still immersive and the narrative is great, becoming quite emotional in some moments and portraying very good a stressed Sheppard, which will show the signs of pressure through the game and have a pretty hard time making some important decisions. It is satisfying to see what the characters of the previous games have become and most of them will return and make u feel the strong friendship they have with the protagonist. As a negative, ME3 story, while still good, fails to exceed that of ME2. The final stage could also have been larger and you will get a very unexpected ending that u may not like at all (I did like it, anyway). If you have played the previous games, then for sure you have to play this one and expect to have your own strong opinion about the end of the saga. If, on the contrary, you haven't playing the previous games, then... What are u doing here? Go to your nearest store and buy this three must-have!",10,2012-04-18,PLAYSTATION 3,user
Old-Jim,"Well, I finished ME3 last week and then spent a week in my spare time reading all about the travesty that was the ME3 ending. Yup, it was beyond awful. It really killed the entire ME experience for me; yes, all three games; five years; all dead. Here are my thoughtsâ",2,2012-04-17,PLAYSTATION 3,user

Tachikoma,"Before clicking to write a review of my own, I checked the current reviews of the game from other people and can see something very sad already. Many people have given it a low score purely out of hatred for ME2 and yet clearly have not played ME3! I, before giving ME3 a chance would have verbally given this a low score myself but having given it a chance I see my error. Now to start, I played the demo **** I hated it. It felt awful to play and showed no RPG elements at all but after my friend Brad said I needed to play it I went out and bought it **** right he was. What I found was an excellent game with brilliant mechanics, a wonderful story and great selection of missions. Everything has been improved over ME2 (which was a travesty) and the story is nicely wrapped up in the end. Yes the endings were not great, and it did feel like trying so hard to get as many troops as possible was pointless in the end but, all things aside, this game blew me away. So I ask that those of you who have written negative reviews and given low scores based purely on nay-sayers in forums, stop being sheep, think for yourselves and actually give the game a go!",9,2012-04-16,PLAYSTATION 3,user

Piapia,"Do not listen to the people rating this game good. Mass Effect 3 is utterly amazing until the last five minutes and if you liked the first 2, you will be god awfully disappointed. Some of the people writing on here seem to think BioWare couldn't pull off something they've pulled off plenty of times before in the previous two games; having your choices matter. Get this game only used, and ignore anyone who tells you otherwise. ME3 is riddled with plot holes and technical issues from lack of properly importing your character to ignoring choices you made in the first two games (in many cases they hand wave you away). The PS3 port is no exception, and it plays awfully on the system. BioWare and EA managed to create the biggest disappointment in gaming history. An epic trilogy filled with deep and meaningful story that you build through your choices... ending in a game that takes account of your choices as much as a rail shooter. The diverse endings they promised don't exist (you get one, with a slight variation in the cinematic at the end; they change the color), your squad from the previous two games largely only get cameos except for a handful, your choices have no effect or ability to change the outcome of the ending (like such as if you make peace with the Geth and Quarians the Catalyst still tells you synthetics and organics can't live together). It's filled with technical issues (textures malfunctioning and glitching out, models breaking in game, the use of 2d sprites instead of 3d [if that bothers you, trust me, you'll notice it]). Even with the **** of the story being ignored, it's just a disappointment ****. You could ignore some of it though if it wasn't for the abysmal ending. Ignore people who tell you it's good... they're the same kind of people who thought the Star Wars prequels had no problems what so ever.",3,2012-04-09,PLAYSTATION 3,user

Kadeemluvmusic,"Mass Effect 3 definitely brings a whole new meaning to the words ""final chapter."" I don't know why some users at Metacritic doesn't even like the game, but can't you see it has a 92 out of 100? Can't you even read what the critics are saying? Although the ending needs a little fixture and BioWare has to solve this problem and fast. I know some fans aren't happy about the ending (Warning: Don't even read the spoilers or you're dead), but I hope they'll make a DLC to the ending sometime soon to get this right and finally Commander Sheppard (Male or Female) couldn't be any more proud than the ladies. Commander Sheppard's romance scenes looked identical than Kratos's kinky side in the God of War series where they featured Mini Sex games. Not bad for a geek who drools over the TV and staring at naked women! Anyway, Mass Effect 3 is perfect. The entire cast, the action, gameplay, life-changing decisions, and everything is fine and dandy except the ending. So I'm still waiting for a low price on the game just the same as Mass Effect 2 and when I buy the game, hopefully I can still get more updates on the ending if there's a DLC or an Expansion Pack in the works. But ""Mass Effect 3"" is no biggie. Just pick up the game, if not, download it on the PS3 Store. Hopefully, I wonder if they could make a XXX parody of the game without the ""M"" on it.

Versidious,"This is not the worst game ever, but it is certainly the most disappointing. It is not just the ending, which is admittedly dismal both emotionally and narratively, but the game in general feels rushed. It provides excellent emotional scenes, demonstrating that Bioware has learned much of linear narration and emotional direction, with some fantastic set-pieces, and has the most enjoyable action of all the trilogy, along with probably the best soundtrack. But that's where the good parts end. Bioware have betrayed their roots, and the series, stripping down player choice to a bare minimum of instances which have little effect on the game's wider world. Dialogue is much reduced, in many cases providing nothing but prerecorded 'click to continue' conversations, which I think we can all agree is a step back of about twenty years in gaming as a whole. The rest provide you with a Shepard of binary character and single beliefs, completely contrary to the previous two games, where the lead character's personality and outlook is decided by the user. There are many short cuts that Bioware have made - perhaps the most glaring is that a multi-million dollar games studio apparently lacks artists to at least create a *decent* picture of a masked character, 'Tali', and surely should have been able to create a full face model, given that the existing model already has a vague face. Perhaps if it had been a minor character, this would have been acceptable. But Tali is a fan favourite, and a central character in all three games. Bioware finally chooses to 'reveal' her face by colouring in a free stock photo from the internet and photoshopping out a couple of the model's fingers. It really is as bad as it sounds. A major villain from ME2, who hunted Shepard and seeks his death constantly and tauntingly throughout that game, plays next to no part in Mass Effect 3, despite being a major character in the background, and again, a fan favourite for his arrogant sinister monologues. The final, seemingly critical choice from the end of Mass Effect 2 also plays very little part. Nor does the final critical choice of Mass Effect 1. In short, Bioware ignores player choice and establishes its own canon instead, not only removing player choice in Mass Effect 3, counter to the spirit of the series so far, but making the player choices in Mass Effect 1 and 2 irrelevant. In this respect, it commits the worst atrocity a finale can make - making the previous instalments irrelevant, taking any meaning away from the preceding journey. And it does this seemingly out of laziness. As for the endings... The motives of the Reapers make you feel like both previous games were actually a waste of time. Attempting to avoid spoilers, there is now no real reason to the actions of the main Reaper antagonists of Mass Effect 1 or 2. The game's final twist (if you could call deus ex machina devices 'twists') could have performed the ME1 antagonist's job for it, and the motives for the Reaperss are revealed as something that makes the antagonists actions in ME2 irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. The game's purported 'multiple endings' are essentially colour-coded explosions, with some different consequences, but also some identical ones. The game's much purported Readiness level changes how many of these choices you get. Hint: None of them are actually good. The game's developer have called it art. I disagree, and cannot get into that now without copious spoilers, but sufficed to say most of the 'art' is in the music, which remains as perfect as it does throughout the game, and provides false tension and emotion, all of which were pretty out of sync with what I was feeling by that point. Everything else is tired, deliberately depressing sci-fi trope, which removes even more player choice than before (The lack of dialogue here is astonishing, given the stakes). Ultimately, what you do in the rest of the game, or the rest of the trilogy, doesn't matter - it is extremely hard not to get all three choices, especially if you play multiplayer. It is astonishing what a drop in quality this is in terms of basic games design and writing, even as the game is the shiniest Bioware game yet. I would not recommend it, and I would no longer recommend any of this doomed trilogy, which is a shame. The promise in ME1&2 was immense, it's just a shame that Bioware fell so hard at the final hurdle...",3,2012-04-05,PLAYSTATION 3,user

Skawt,"Okay, first off I have to say that this game, despite its flaws is no where near being a zero, so enough of your and all of the pouty fanboy **** in the world couldn't convince me otherwise. This game is such an improvement in so many ways; my only real complaint would be the ending . Despite your earlier decisions Shepard's story seems to end at the conclusion of this game. And the ending itself veers off much much too far into the realm of fantasy for my taste (or most people's tastes given the low scores). The ending of ME3 probably rates as one of the biggest letdowns in video game history in fact, because the three games were all so fun with such rich backstories and great characters. I am saddened to see Mass Effect go out this way, but cmon you all know it deserves better than a one or a zero. 8/10",0,2012-04-04,PLAYSTATION 3,user

Reportedly there is 40 hours of game play in Mass Effect 3 plus multiplayer that i frankly do not care much about. I've heard that many have problem with the game ending but this is not the reason to give this game 0 score. Graphics are solid, animations are solid. Bioware put a lot of effort into this game. Once I started playing the game i could not stop. I got hooked up on it instantaneously. Controls are pretty much the same as in ME2 so the learning curve was short for me.

Taken as a whole, ME3 is a masterfully put together story, with amazing music, deep relationships and excellent and diverse combat.

Epic, surreal and incredibly engaging, the entirety of this game should not be missed, regardless of the ending. It is a perfect game in storytelling and gripping fashion. The ending didn't ruin the series for me, but dampened it. But not as badly as most people are saying. You are missing out on a game that defines this generation's lust for story.

Huey_Freeman,"I'm not a big fan of Mass Effect 3's ending. I thought it was convoluted and anticlimactic for anticlimatic's sake. Though a lot of about the ending actually does work. I loved the fade out while I was rushing down to the last destroyer with my brother's in arms. I loved the fade in to Shephard badly injured and slowly walking towards her/his destiny awaiting him/her deep inside of The Citadel. I loved Anderson and Shepard communicating for opposite ends of The Citadel discussing what was going on. The long walk way up into The Illusive Man's secret hideout. It was all very atmospheric and epic and kind of beautiful. I thought the paragon/rendegade prompts were good as well during the ""standoff"". And I actually liked the twist that the little boy was The Catalyst. But the 3 choices he gives you were indeed pretty lame. And the lack of exposition following said decision was just plain bad. You can't end a game that encompasses over 140 hours of gameplay and millions of decisions made by the player with just 3 crew members walking off of the Normandy and just cut to the credits....EVEN IF you're planning on releasing DLC. There is a lot of room for criticism for that horrible decision made by whoever at Bioware that made it. I can't believe that ending got all the way to the final product. Its actually kind of sad. But, it DID NOT ruin the game or the series for me. Because it wasn't the fact that Shephard was destined to die (or **** still don't know do we) that actually is kind of good when you think about it. Its life. Sometimes no matter what decisions you make you can't fight your fate and what is going to be is just going to be. Your destiny is something you must embrace. Which is why I chose the middle option and made Shephard sacrifice herself. Yes, HERSELF. Female Shephard is a MILLION TIMES better than male Shephard and I'm a dude. From the voice acting (Jennifer Hale is amazing and the guy voices male Shepard is very boring) to character design she is just so much more fun to play with. Seriously if you haven't played the games thru with Fem Shep you are doing yourself a HUGE disservice as I have found the game way better controlling her. But back to 3, the game is incredible. There are so many jaw-dropping moments and sheer brilliance (if you haven't played thru with the From Ashes DLC you are missing out on what I find to be the best addiction to the game - Javik and his story). The improvements in shooting and offensive strategy are borderline limitless. And I had a remarkable experience playing the game.

shadowhawk749,"Is ME3 really this bad? Yes it is.. If your a fan of the series and spent countless hours within 1 and 2, this purchase will be your biggest regret. IF you don't care about consistency, have not played either of the 1st two, don't care about false advertising, and just want to play a corny game, then this is for you. Gameplay isn't changed too much from the 2nd, although it feels a little smoother. Graphically nearly identical, no real improvement other then some areas are more shiny. The overwhelming majority has a great distaste for the way EA/Bioware has marketed this game and there tactics throughout the process, along with the obviously rushed and idiotic ending. Any company that states - You've become a legend. To continue, buy extended content - at the end **** is low, and I hope they file bankruptcy. Day one DLC is bad enough, to boast about it in game is pathetic.. Is that what this gen will leave behind? It's unmistakable foray into each game leaving out gameplay to charge ridiculous amounts for minimum content? The game itself lacks something that 1 and 2 had, that certain level of immersion where you forget or completely ignore the faults of the game, because its plot and characters are that well developed. Something special that makes you remember each encounter and actually care about the decisions you make. The 3rd has none of this. Your choices from 1 and 2 are barely visible in 3, sometimes plot-lines are completely absurd compared to what you had done previously. You put Anderson on the council? Too bad, Udina is on it now with no explanation. Did you kill Wrex in 1? He's back! Let the Rachni die off? They found more! Literally nothing matters.. Every decision you may have made has been streamlined into 1 basic plot that doesn't do the series justice, nor does it even make sense. People and Bioware who are wondering why people are so mad, and think its only because there spoiled and want a happy ending truly have no idea whats going on.. The entire series has been marketed as a decision based trilogy where you were shaping your own story as Shepard, Bioware was just giving you the tools. Mass amounts of interviews were conducted and published promoting this idea and a plethora of different endings were guaranteed (at least 16). Bioware told us every decision would matter... In the end, the only decision that mattered was that they got your money. The end is one singular loop that plays out exactly the same, no matter what you ""choose"" - they just contain different color filters on the cgi video. Thats lazy developing and a scam for what was marketed to consumers. The end is not art either. This is a business first and foremost. They wouldn't spend millions to make and advertise it if not. Think of it this way. You go to an art show and an artist displays a ""new, unique painting that has never been seen before, where its level of obscurity and detail will transcend your mind"". It's covered and your not allowed to see it until its purchased and you've brought it home. You buy it.. but once your get it home, you realize its nothing more than a ripped piece of paper with a poop smear.. You'd want your money back. That's false advertising, its not only unethical, but illegal. Just because this is a ""game"", does not give it the right to abuse consumers. Overall, if you want a recap of the ending, its like this: Your girl/boy friend has cheated on you. You feel betrayed and remember none of the good times, because of the horrible trauma that it's caused you emotionally . The ending is the last thing you see, therefore its the last thing you remember. Bad outweighs the good. It can take years to trust somebody, but 5 seconds to break that.. and this is one of those instances. Nobody cares that Shepard died, its the fact that your decisions and squad mates don't matter and the countless hours of gameplay are useless, along with severe plot crippling holes. Wait for this game to be entirely remade before buying if your a fan of the series and plot.. you will regret your purchase.

funky_monkey,"Everyone has pretty much already said everything there is about wether the ending is good or bad so i wont talk about that. All i say is keep an open mind and you might enjoy it. I thought overall it was a pretty good game game with interesting features such as how you can customize your weapons more to your fighting style. This game does a good job at telling you what everyone is up to and concludes the small endings pretty well. I think my biggest complaint was how there was not as many team members to choose from as there was in the last game and not as many speech options and situations were you could choose the speech. I don't really care that the ending might not be that diverse and am kinda glad too because it makes the ending more finite. The real reason i play this game is not for the big story of saving the universe but the small story of the people you deal with and the interactions with them. That part of the game makes it more real, knowing your fighting to save your lover is more important than saving strangers. I feel this game may have some small flaws but it more than makes up for it by the deep story it tells along the way. If you enjoyed LOST, then you will absolutely love this game. My biggest gripe and recommendation for the next Mass Effect game if there ever is one is more lesbian relationships, not really a complaint but something I personally would like. This is a great experience with great relationships both friends and lovers of either sex alike.

Bazooka21,"Mass Effect 3 Great- Story. Commander Shepard is fully fleshed out as a character and the game makes you care about its end. Each story is fully developed and every decision influences the next. - Customization. Let's you choose everything from gender,weapons, and abilities. Exploring them demands multiple playthroughs. - Side Missions. The amount of missions affect the ending but aren't necessary. The length can vary from mission to mission so it's always an unexpected and never tedious. Mixed - The Ending. I played Mass effect 2 prior to playing this one, so I was already invested. The ending did not leave me incredibly unsatisfied. I didn't fly off the handle looking for some kind of consolation. It was a bit incomplete but like the other things I invested hours in like, Lost, Seinfeld, and The Sopranos it was the journey that made it worth it. - Frame rate. The graphics were spectacular and it was definitely an upgrade over the second, but it not only would suffer slowdown in hectic areas, but during key moments which could be a little off putting. - Squad selection. The amount of characters in Mass Effect 2 was astounding, but not all necessary. Here it's cut down to more than half which is better yet with its faults. It does limit your choices making missions frustrating if you don't realize your preferences early on. Amiss - Load times. Realizing that a game of this size would require some patience was understandable. Yet some of the areas of the game defied logic with its constant load times. One specific area was the ship which would let you pass through inconsistently between five and sometimes thirty seconds. - Difficulty. Not complaining about the difficulty at all. I chose hardcore and enjoyed the rush. It was the spike in difficulty that irked me. One area early on had me trying for two hours while the next I cruised through. This happens a couple of times and seems to be to just lengthen the game which doesn't really need to. - Shopping. The amount of items are great but by the time you can buy the most expensive weaponry, your guns are already equipped with the best upgrades that can match them or exceed it. It becomes purely a accessory like the fish or models.",9,2012-03-26,PLAYSTATION 3,user

You will fall from the map, become immortal, enemies will turn invisible, be teleported into the scenario, the server will crash midgame, you get an error when trying to buy things....

dominionator,"Still the same great mass effect story and characters and gamplay we have come to know in the previous games. Game is more story focused as bioware did away with tedious planet scanning etc. and the firefight gameplay is complimented with great level design.

Such a bad-ass game/trilogy deserves a bad-ass ending, its not for sure dumb weak sauce stuff the last 15 minutes.

coldcalculated,"After careful consideration i am ready to give my opinion as unbiasedly as possible. The game is shorter than the second installment but the production values and story are better. The environments look fantastic but character models are not the best. This installment is better than the first two in terms of gameplay. Movement and cover system are vastly improved from the last two games. Very little effort is required for the sidequests which pretty much consist of fetching items for people. I did not like that there were no side quests available after scanning random planets, something i really enjoyed from the first two. I was really disappointed that none of the characters from me2 were available on your squad in this game (excluding garrus and tali). I felt that this game was shorter than the last two but not significantly. Love the customization, (most of) the writing, the weapons, the new and improved biotic powers. I cant even begin the describe how atrocious the ending of this game was. The whole game was amazing to play until this moment. The brilliance of the entire series is undermined by the ending. Whoever wrote the ending of this game should be banned from writing. Anything. Ever.",9,2012-03-22,PLAYSTATION 3,user

Pointlessreview,"I came into the series at Mass Effect 2 and it's one of my favourite games of all time. This, however, will Probably be forgotten rather quickly. The graphics are jaw dropping and the music is second to none. However the voice acting and the way there is a gap (sometimes seconds long) between a character being interrupted/ cut off mid sentence and the next player starting his/her next sentence. Really jarring. I'm a pretty liberal guy and have no problem in essence with there being homosexual activity in a game but this feels shoehorned in. The action sequences are good if slightly samey and the game feels alot more polished and finished than other reviewers bitter about the day 1 dlc would have you believe. This game could have been incredible and instead it's just good. A shame but that's always been the problem with sequels across all forms of media.",8,2012-03-21,PLAYSTATION 3,user

Leftyy,"In short, I never believed that the ending was as bad as everyone said it could be, turns out I was wrong. When you're actually playing the end, it doesn't feel as awful as most would make it out to be. But in the moments after the game ends and you ponder what you've just finished, you will realize your true disappointment in the ending of the game. The elimination of any type of ending variation, lack of closure, and a short, lazy little cutscene filled with unanswered plotholes should answer your question as to why it's so awful without spoiling anything. In short, the ending was just bad, and it takes away from the exciting couple of hours that lead up to it. I might give this a higher score, but honestly, I can't say the ending was the only problem. Never mind the dlc, who cares about that. My beef lies with the technical points of the game and the gunplay itself. Obviously most of you enjoy the gunplay and I know I'll get flak for this, but even in Mass Effect 2 I found it to be boring and unoriginal, it feels like a stiff cover shooter that seems like a dumbed down version of Uncharted except with those gimmicky biotic powers. Also, the game has a really poor framerate that will annoy you throughout much of the game, terrible lip-syncing, and to top it all off the game froze on me a few times and I had to reboot my PS3. To be honest, I don't think was an abysmal game, but it will never live up to the second chapter in the series' greatness nor will it ever be considered one of the great video games of this generation. Although I think it deserves all this hate, I find it sad that Bioware was stubborn enough to butcher its greatest franchise, and what's even more sad is that it's probably EA's fault for making Bioware rush the ending so that they could get it out before the end of the fiscal quarter. That's just plain wrong. I don't care whether they're going to patch the ending or not, I'm selling this game before the price takes a nose dive when no one wants to buy this piece of garbage.",4,2012-03-21,PLAYSTATION 3,user

Waldschatten,"Taken as a stand-alone game I'd likely rate it as around five, and that's with a few points off for the horrible ending.

dmjrnbsn,"One of the most profoundly disappointing endings to any story in any medium. The writers removed the cornerstone in which the entire story was built upon - choice and consequence. So, the entire building comes crashing down at the end. In the end, none of the choices your character makes throughout three games matter. All the relationships you've built are meaningless. There is no closure in the relationships made, whether between LIs or squad mates. They never come to fruition, and there is no resolution. ME3 was advertised to have a multitude of outcomes based upon players' choices. That's what originally made the Mass Effect franchise such a great success. The finale should have raised the player to great heights or taken the player to despair... and everywhere between based upon the consequences of the player's decisions throughout the entirety of the series(Paragon, Renegade, or somewhere in between). BioWare should have finished their remarkable work on the strengths that it was built on. Choice and consequence. It seemed like a given, but... You leave the game feeling complete and utter disappointment. It is truly remarkable how an ending can be so profoundly and remarkably bad. It truly destroys the franchise entirely. This is not an easy thing to say, as I've loved the series from the start. There is no replay value at all. BioWare has ruined years of work in the last ten minutes on what should have been one of the greatest RPGs of all time.

People need to get off their high horse and actually have fun with games. I haven't dabbled into the single player story yet but my assumption is the low score is due to fan-boys getting all bent out of shape due to unrealistic expectations.

funkamonkey,"Mass Effect 3 is a very very good game. It's not an RPG, it's an action game with some RPG elements, ie levelling up powers and some moral choices. I admit I've not had time to finish it yet but I'm enjoying the ride. If you enjoyed ME2 this is more of the same, you meet some old friends and watch some die. On the PS3 version there are a lot of glitches, especially in cut scenes but it is a big game. Weapons are varied and powers are very useful in tight situations. After the initial battle on earth it calms down and sometimes feels a bit mellow considering the situation facing all living beings. I've had some great battles but I've also had a lot of walking about doing nothing. There are some missed opportunities that Bioware should have grasped with both hands but it's still a great game. Some of the game feels like an afterthought, like somebody said, hey lets drive an Atlas, for a very short time! The multiplayer is good fun as well but I've suffered a lot of disconnections, and they seem to be when I'm top of the leaderboard and on wave 10, ho hum.

As far as the ending, personally I enjoyed it (even after being with the series since ME 1, which I completed on PC), and left the game feeling both sad for the characters I watched grow and sad that the trilogy has at last come to a close.

ROGUE-BOLO,"I was a huge fan of the Mass Effect franchise (and Bioware games in general). Honestly, I even really like SWtOR. But Mass Effect 3 was a huge disappointment! What I hated most: 3. Meaningful interactions with most of your love interests from ME1 & ME2 reduced to unsatisfying cameos, 2. New movement options for Shepard in combat that can be horribly frustrating because they all share the same key as the one used to enter cover (i.e.: I have several times tried to sprint through a door only to find myself rolling back and forth between one side of the door and another, or attempting to leap over cover to flee attackers only to have the game decide I would rather ""go into cover"" on the wrong side, etc.) and worst of all 1. Three almost identical but horrible endings that totally ignored all of my choices made in the saga up to that point. In my opinion, they not only removed 100% of ME3's replay value (I played ME1 & ME2 dozens to times) but tainted the rest of the saga for me. As far as I am concerned, Jar Jar Binks did less to ruin Star Wars... After all, I did not sink 100+ hours into playing Star Wars after being told my choices would carry through and they would matter! And putting further salt in our wounds, these endings were abrupt, incongruous with the pace and story of the games up to that point, and glaringly inconsistent with established canon (For instance: If one Mass Relay detonating in The Arrival took out an entire star system what does losing ALL of them mean to the survivors in the galaxy?!!! How about a little QA, guys?) If EA/Bioware have any hope of painting themselves out of this corner, I would suggest they look on the Internet for all of the threads discussing ""Indoctrination Theory"" and deliver us a DLC to 'fix"" the endings along those lines ASAP. I know, it is your ""art"" and your ""artistic vision"", blah, blah, blah... But you sold the whole ME franchise with the promise of ""Real choices that make a difference. Honestly, guys, for ME3 it is time to live up to that. The bottom line is that for me, Mass Effect 3 was a huge letdown because of the ending. The people responsible for it should be tarred and feathered and run out of town on a rail. For all those of you who would respond ""Most of it was pretty good, so you are just an unreasonable jerk for making a big deal out of a bad ending"" or ""It is their work of art, so chill man,"" let me put it this way: Mass Effect 3 is like meeting a hot chick at a bar. You hit it off real well, see a movie together and have a nice dinner. In the cab on the way home, she shows you some special tricks she can do with those full red lips of hers. Eventually, you get her upstairs and disrobed, only to find out that ""she"" is really a ""he"" (Assuming you are not into that, OK?) . That extra sausage in the fridge might not seem like much to some, but if you wanted tacos for dinner it's a pretty big freaking deal. And yeah, sure, 95% of the date was pretty awesome, but that last part kind of spoiled the whole thing for you... After 5+ years, 3 games and 200+ hours of combined play and replay, I think we all deserved better. So dear Bioware/EA: Fix the damn ending (Internet threads on Indoctrination Theory could give you some good ideas)! It does not have to be sunshine and rainbows, but it should at least follow canon, make some logical sense, answer more questions than it raises and give me a feeling that all my Shepard's sacrifice and work over the past 5 years had some meaning.",0,2012-03-19,PLAYSTATION 3,user

BOSTONJOHN32,"Well i will start by saying that im amazed that critics scored this game nearly perfect but not many went into detail about ending, never mention it @ all or simply (and boldly) allowed readers to think the game was great from start to finish, then i happened 2 go ""outside the bubble"" and found smaller, more obscure reviews and the score factored in that the ending was ""literary suicide"" as one wrote. as quoted by r. ebert ""if you had to ask what it symbolized, then it didnt"" and i can say that this very much sums up the ending, struck in awe like many, i wasnt even sure if i had beat the game and had to check mt trophy in order to sort out if i did. thats just it, i felt like i did not know what had just happened and had to wait for the credits to scroll to know its over,and so i convince myself that ok maybe i just did not see the right ending and maybe i got the bad ending, ""yes that must be it, w/ so many endings i must have screwed up along the way and got the bad ending"" come to find out i got the desired and the most ""definative"" ending.. so then i go back and replay the mission etc and all the other endings are pretty much identical beside a different color or ""end sequence"" which consisted of a minute or so animation of walking another direction etc. i wont get into conspiracy theories or anything which is out of context but its kind of hard not to fall prey or offer self to some distraction or debate because we not only invested time, we invested emotion.. hours upon hours of carefully making right choices for a desired import etc, and for what? if i kind of got a heads up from critics that ""decisions do not play as significant a role in mass 3 as it did in the prior 2"" then i wouldve been able to prepare,lol.. but we are hearing words like art, story telling masterpiece also we were told by bioware that this would have multiple endings, a deeper consequence/decision mechanic, an end which would the opposite from lost, well no it may actually take the belt away from lost for the wtf just happened moment but the fact is that i shouldve known that a game which has a formula that works almost seamlessly, based primarily on decisions as well as story driven sequences which make the gamer care, think and DECIDE, it works so good that while i played every mass efect i made every decision carefully to prep my shep for the import into the next game, so if i am playing a game and already thinking of the next one then the system is almost flawless imo.. BUT it is obvious E.A had a bit of influence and brings me back to my point with this ""formula"", they deserted it and decided for MASS APPEAL rather than mass effect and i noticed this during the demo and how much emphasis was put on how one can play the game how one wishes and that the game can be toggled to suit any style, dont like stories? choose combat.. hate decisions? well you can toggle that too.. but wait, isnt that the part of mass effect which makes it like few others? and isnt that what i have spent many hours doing to have a desired and effective playthrough as well as end? was it just me or did it feel silly to scan planets this time around? as to say ""hey dont want to waste time scanning for elements, well we fixed that too"" huh? call me a loser, call me what you want BUT i enjoyed taking my time scanning for minerals and elements and launching probes with a feeling of purpose, because that was one of the many things which made me love this game, felt like what i did mattered and fulfilling. i can understand E.A 's stance from a business perspective, their knowledge and tactics of knowing that the fanbase of mass effect are going to buy this game regardless so lets find some fresh blood, but did the solid core and fan base have to feel jipped, let down, disappointed, confused and as well as angry in exchange for new profits/gains? well the core, the fans well we are mass effect. it breaths because we let it, we let it because it was great ,brought quality and emotion and stood apart from many other games and the exp was one like few others. but as much respect a game/developer may get through time can be undone in ten minutes.. i can not say that mass effect 3 was a bad game, but after putting in hours of decisions, careful choices to have it not effect anything in regards to the end , other than the war assets and ""co-op""readiness , well i feel like it was more of a ""okay hurry up and get this over with and go play co-op after"" the fact remains that mass effect 3 is still a solid game, but an ending which was promised to be the finale we dream about also being admittedly rushed well how does anything rushed ever result to anything other than sub par to par? a game is about the exp, mass effect is about a unique and gripping exp BUT the end ruined both.. its obvious a lot has changed in the gaming industry in the past 5 years, mass effect supports this in every respect, reapers went from FEAR INDUCING to PAWNS.",6,2012-03-19,PLAYSTATION 3,user

The game is better off as single player like it supposed to be from the very beginning. It's not about entitlement or anything like that.

It is ridiculous. This is a damn good game and deserves a much better score. The improvements in this game mainly go into combat. Combat is much easier compared to Mass Effect 1 and 2 and Shepard feels more agile.

The Side quest system is pure and utter **** I dont even want to emphasize on this one. I dont know how bioware would get such a simple Quest-Tracker system wrong. The Story is great and lovable and was seriously good until the ending. The Ending is so wrong. Just so very wrong.

The overall game has been changed in some areas, Combat feels better than ever, while the RPG conversational part has been toned down a lot. It's great, but it needed to be a lot better.

As such this mess is such a shame for what had been such a promising series. In my humble opinion it is that bad. And it's sad.

Combat is more dynamic (for me, ME2 was too slow in terms of movement), and it's new features are quite addictive - side roll and unlimited run time (ough, finally, N7 graduate that actually can run), in particular. Yes, it's not so RPG (neither ME2 was), and advertisement trailers are just lies (i'm talking about ""interactive storytelling"" one here). Dialogs (and dialog options) are fewer and shorter. There are some annoying things (like scanner between CIC and war room, that stops you for about 5 seconds every time - goddamn thing, why is it here?), some bugs (most of them are sound or interface related - displaying incorrect info), and framerate drops - in intensive cutscenes, usually. Sure, it's all understandable and forgivable. Earth is under siege, so why are you chatting down here? It could be a [hidden] timer for how much more Earth can sustain, but there is no such a thing. Perhaps it's for the better. I was worried about music - but it fits well. And no more sound warping (heeeeavy doppler effect) when running, at last. Voice acting and lip sync are good. Many people complaining about they haven't got any answers in ending. Perhaps they lack perception, knowledge of basic physics or just don't want to think, i can't guess. For me, the only question i've left was ""why the hell Normandy engaged FTL drives?"". Ending is good for me (well, at least the one i have chosen - and almost without any doubts), and closing cinematic is very emotional.",9,2012-03-18,PLAYSTATION 3,user
SirYakalot,"Fantastic design, everything else lacks. This game suffers hugely from the same thing that fable 2 and 3 did - we loved the first one and forgave its flaws simply because it was a first game, but it's the third game now and the flaws are still there.

I've spent five years on this franchise working hard to make all the right choice in order to have a closure that suits my expectations! However, the ending made me feel as if none of that mattered! I've lost interest in continuing the game or even replay anywhere in the near future. I was also frustrated by BW's day-one DLC policy! It made me feel cheep! As I'm nothing but money-milking mating for the Big Gaming Kahunas. THE ENDING MUST BE CORRECTED! BW is a great company that makes great RPG's.

TerryH,"No other game gives you the ability to make choices that their consequences or rewards would expand over multiple games... Mass Effect Saga does that, and that was what was most appealing to me about it. It truly has replay value written across all 3 games, and that is something that is not showcased in any other game I have played. The story in ME3 is massive, and when you take into account the full plotline from the time you stepped down on Eden Prime to destroying the Collecters... it's truly a Saga that should honestly be considered an instant classic! Aside from the story, the gameplay is fantastic. Much better than ME1 and an improvement over ME2. The Soundtrack feels a bit old, but it's the tone of the music that intensifies during combat that really makes you feel helpless while being overwhelmed by husks! Loved every minute.

crazycat690,"I'll admit it right now, I'm biased towards the Mass Effect games, I see them as mediocre games with little RPG to them... Then I played the second game, it had flaws, boring at times but the character interaction was fun and worked well. I was also surprised how good it was to play as a character you pretty much created and then chose how he was going to be like. Most of this remains true for Mass Effect 3, it's slightly tuned down though, as an example the ""good or bad"" options don't matter as much. I still got into it, the gameplay feels very good, but that might be a downside... They've focused on making it feel like a smoother TPS experience, and that they have succeeded with, but the choices have been trimmed down and the RPG elements have yet become even more shallow. The game is still a true Mass Effect game, I'm just saying that if you buy it expecting a brilliant RPG instead of a decent shooter then you will probably be disappointed. Now to the controversy that's surrounding Mass Effect 3, the day one DLC, gay relationship and the ending, don't worry no spoilers! The DLC, while I assume you don't have to buy it I did and it worked well with the rest of the game except you get an overpowered weapon with infinite ammo. I would like to see how it all plays out without the prothean, because in my playthough he did affect the game in pretty interesting ways, although 10 bucks for the DLC was a stretch... Ok, so the gay relationships, if you have a problem with that you are an **** who don't deserve nice things anyway, so if that ruins the game for you, good, that's karma. No more comments on that, moving to the ending! Once again, no spoilers, while MANY fans are pretty pissed about it I'm not a true fan, I thought it was... Okay, I mean it could have been alot better but if nothing else it concluded the story. I mean, it didn't make much sense, it felt pretty half assed but I don't think they'll be making any weird sequels from this, and that I must say I respect. So is it worth your money? Well read my review again and find out, if you don't have any problems with anything I've said then go ahead, I don't regret buying it for one! I played the Ps3 version, and while there were slight lag in some cutscenes it was nothing serious and the gameplay itself was pretty smooth. Thanks for reading!",8,2012-03-15,PLAYSTATION 3,user

Twist_of_Cain87,"Unfortunately this is a game that attracts the biggest of internet trolls. There is tons to love in this game and a few that I really miss from earlier iterations. I like that it is about political dealing and survival again rather than the run a gunning of Mass Effect 2. I like that they were able to take some of the conversations out of your hands based on your reputation. I like the better scanning methods for planets so that you don't spend all your time hoarding resources. I like being able to customize my armor and weapons. I like that the multiplayer is a functional part of creating the ending rather than just a breeding ground for stat ****. I miss some of the great party members from Mass Effect 2, but like that they resolve their storylines in this game. If you have a problem with gays, than don't pursue that romance option. If you have a problem with EA's marketing strategy for From Ashes DLC, than don't buy it. The combat is tight, the controls are solid, and it looks and sounds like Mass Effect. While certain complaints are valid, it does not warrant the backlash it has received. The gaming community is a sad beast that tears apart the few story tellers that are trying to create new and vivid worlds for you to explore with the tact and intellect of a petulant, spoiled child.",9,2012-03-14,PLAYSTATION 3,user

bsNYC,"Good: Gameplay mechanics are vastly improved. While not as polished as a Gears of War, it's still very fun to play. Never felt cheated when I died and every victory felt like an accomplishment. Bravo Bioware! On an interpersonal level, the story is tightly crafted. If you enjoyed forging relationships among the dramatis personae then you will love ME3 in this regard. The story, on this micro level, is quite simply superb. As far as the multiplayer goes, admittedly, I am not much of a multiplayer gamer so my opinion may not matter but I really enjoyed this new feature of ME3. The addition of biotics really makes it more fun (for me) than it would be if it were just shooting. The Bad: A lot of your decisions from previous games are rendered meaningless in the third game, which is a shame considering we were sold on ME being ""our"" story. But I suppose it wouldn't be cost effective to develop such extensively branching storylines and risk having that content go unused. It's a bit dejecting at first especially if those decisions were painstaking but the fun factor of these missions (that shouldn't exist had your decisions in previous games mattered) should mitigate any malcontent. Not a lot of ""bad"" in ME3 but the PS3 version is glitchy. Not skyrim glitchy, but definitely not the polish you'd expect from a game whose release date was pushed back half a year. The Ugly: ME3 has an ending but not a denouement. There's no closure. In fact, there's a rather desultory twist that doesn't make sense. ""My Shepard"" (something I was sold on as being important) fought to unite a divided galaxy and also fought for the lives of his loved ones. All the decisions and dialogue choices I made were consistent along this arc. To have the fruits of his labors culminate in an ending that leaves both his friends dead and his briefly united galaxy fragmented left me downright crestfallen. It took a couple of days to get over it. From a videogame? **** first I was embarrassed by this fact but in reality this poignancy is a true testament to Bioware's creation. If you play story-driven games for the immersion (as do I), then Bioware's trilogy is undeniably for you. My only hope is that the end of the game is not really the ending (while it takes some intellectual acrobatics, you can infer from quite a few clues that the ending of ME3 might not be the ending at all). ME3 has the potential to make a lot of money for EA so I doubt EA would have the story end this way when its continuance is quite profitable. Moreover, Bioware, and in particular ME's writer, is too good at storytelling for ME3 to end without true closure. I'm not saying all stories need a happily-ever-after ending. Macabre endings or even open-ended finales can be well crafted, provided they flow naturally from the thematic arc. ME3's ending sadly does not. Let's hope the conspiracy theories are true and the saga continues... But, as is, the endings provided on the disc are bad and drag the score down to an 8.5ish range. Subtract some more for the bugs and you have a solid 8. I've never been a fan of numbered scores; the price I'd be willing to pay for a game is really a more accurate metric for me (I thought Vanquished was a solid 8 but I wouldn't pay more than $25 for that game whereas Dragon Age: Origins's lackluster graphics and frame-rate issues precluded anything higher than an 8 but I would pay $100 for that masterpiece). ME3: I'd happily pay $75 for this game (and I did since I wanted the day 1 DLC).",8,2012-03-13,PLAYSTATION 3,user

Spazgadget,"First, the good news: the Mass Effect 3 universe continues one of the most compelling, well-articulated, and deep environments ever put in a console game; a living universe utterly overflowing with locations, species, factions, and cultures. Rarely has a video game world felt so rich, expansive, and detailed, and very, very few games can boast a universe as dizzyingly immersive as Mass Effect's. That said, the game isn't without its faults, and while it's an easy game to fall in love with, it is hard to ignore its problems. Graphically, the game has a hard time keeping up with the action more often than not (even in cutscenes) and the constantly sluggish framerate quickly becomes an irritation. Character models, though attractive, don't really show that much improvement from ME2, and character movement in combat is decidedly clumsy, and in a game that requires quick movement and reaction time, is often problematic. For a game this late in a console cycle, these issues rightly should have been resolved at this point. For those who enjoyed the ""RPG"" side of Mass Effect, you might be slightly disappointed in this entry's turn in direction towards military strategy and shooter mechanics. While you are given the option to play the game one of three ways, favoring different amounts of story over combat, the game largely remains one large preparation for war. While it keeps true to the general plot line of the Mass Effect trilogy, I couldn't help but feeling I was in some jingoistic Army recruitment campaign, something that inescapably rubbed this player the wrong way. As suggested by my score, it is overall a terrific, quality game, with a few problems. It's hard to find fault with Mass Effect 3, but it needs to be noted that the trilogy has become a more aggressive experience tonally, and has not seen suitable improvements in combat, movement, or graphics that one would expect this late into the series. Overall, a winner, but know what you're getting before you buy.",8,2012-03-13,PLAYSTATION 3,user

It is hard to say much without spoiling things and because im not the most descriptive person, but I will leave you with these words BEST GAME EVER!!!!",10,2012-03-12,PLAYSTATION 3,user

Ezaviel,"I have enjoyed Mass Effect 3 a lot. It's nice to see so many of my decisions in 1 and 2 show up again, even if it's just a character referred to in a news broadcast. I fail to see the basis for a lot of the dialogue and plot complaints. Though the dialogue trees in conversation are mostly ""choose either paragon or renegade"", only 2 optoins, which is annoying. The storytelling is good as usual, and some of the scenes are very well done. Normally I don't give 10s, but looking at the scores, a binary ""0 or 10"" seems to be the way to go. So, since I liked this game, 10 it is.",10,2012-03-11,PLAYSTATION 3,user
kburstall,"Take away the compelling story from the mass effect series and what are you left with? Most people would agree we're left with little more than a sub-par shooter. Bioware often gets a pass on this because the story elements are so strong and interesting. NOT THIS TIME OUT. The story and especially the incomprehensible nonsense ending make for a tale that **** the awesome not only out of this game, but also out of the rest of the franchise which have been building up to an epic ending, where literally NONE of your choices throughout the entire series make an impact. Not having this strong story to keep you going, be prepared to suffer through this sub-par shooter",1,2012-03-11,PLAYSTATION 3,user
dab87,"I bought this game after reading multiple game site reviews all giving this game a high rating, rationalizing it through saying that the scope and conceptual design of this game make it a quality product. I am here to say I am no longer going to purchase a game based on ""critic"" reviews. This game ruined the Mass Effect series for me. BioWare has clearly sold its soul to EA and no longer cares about the quality writing and storytelling that existed in this games predecessors. This game is like Dragon Age 2 all over again. As I played through I began to care less and less about the decisions I made and simply wanted to finish the game. Nothing was compelling enough to have me play through it again and I will definitely be selling this game the second I beat it as to ensure I get the most money back. I can say nothing more than that I am frustrated and completely disappointed in BioWare, and will boycott game that include DAY 1 DLC for as long as they continue to come out. $74 for a game with DAY ONE... DAY ONE... dlc is outrageous, especially for a ""dumbed down"" product. Sorry BioWare, but you have tarnished my once high opinion of you and have lost a customer.",3,2012-03-11,PLAYSTATION 3,user

PulsivePanda,"The game had potential, the series had potential. But then the ending happened, the recoloured ending. It's sickening, really. Because everybody knows that in a week or two, they're going to announce a alternate ending DLC for another sum of money. Which is completely wrong, and I do believe this is the end of BioWare. I followed the games since ME1, and I loved the series to BITS. As a game reviewer, and lover of games. I can't be biased towards a group of people, and I'm not trying to be. It's just- I can't see BioWare being a major power after this act. I cannot. The game itself has some pretty fancy action, but the characters seem so flat. There's no real depth to your squad mates, they're just there talking to you. The animation, and lip-synching is straight up horrible. And the writing is even worse. I can't see how any reviewer worth their own salt gave this a 100/100, unless of course they haven't even played the game, or were bought off. There is NO possible way. I'd like to see the DLC they come out with, with the ""true"" ending, but I really can't stand BioWare to buy anymore of their dribble. Do not buy the game, stay away from this one. If you're curious, there's Youtube for a reason, use it, instead. Save your money for a game, and a company that doesn't treat their fans like utter sheep.",0,2012-03-10,PLAYSTATION 3,user

goblue22,"This game is absolutely AMAZING right up until the final 15 minutes or so. The end of the game is really a slap in the face to anyone who has stayed with the series from the beginning. I am not saying this because I did not get the end that I wanted. I would have been perfectly fine with an ending in which everyone died - because at the very least that would have been a clear and well defined end. This series has always been defined and advertised as character driven. The player is encouraged to get invested in and attached to the characters in the Mass Effect universe. And yet the way this game ends is simply unacceptable. The ending gives very little understanding of exactly what happened, and the player is given very little to go on in terms of the fates of the characters. I have never been one to write reviews or have strong opinions on games. I am not even one who typically gets attached to series the way I got attached to Mass Effect. But the way the end of the game seems like Bioware came up with it in maybe 10 minutes is, in my opinion, a betrayal of the fans.",0,2012-03-10,PLAYSTATION 3,user

I was not going to write a review because that game was IMO close to master piece but after seeing so many 0 review I decided to write one. This game its flaw like every games, some other review says its not a RPG anymore, BS, some said that the shooting mechanic was bad, which is totally BS, its improved from the 1st and 2nd ME. Some are mad because there is a DLC, just dont buy it, its not mandatory, if you bought the Collectors edition you got it free, otherwise its 10$. Which is not big deal for a game you can play over 50hrs, even without the dlc. Those who gave that game a 0 are just unfair to the game, because its not exactly as they want they are mad, some crybabies. My verdict is, definatly worth purchase, that game is awesome, story is good, its immersive and the replay value is great.

The idiots complaining about the RPG aspect being stripped away either never played 2 which had little to none of that or never played the series at all and are just bulls*%$^g because they believe every flame and lie they read on a message board. Don't even get me started on the people tanking the score because of the option for a gay story line! THIS IS 2012 YOU IGNORANT PEABRAINS! You're a disgrace, and people have been asking for this option to be included since the first game! I really love the PS# but I have to admit that most of these scores are probably coming from PS3 users who never bothered to play 2 after it was released for the system and bought the game based on hype alone, not knowing anything about it or it's history. A bunch of idiot meatheads who should just wait for the next COD or Madden piece o' crud and in the meantime keep their heads up their asses where they belong. As far as the day one DLC, this content was fully available to those who per-ordered and got collector's editions of the game. I personally just traded in a few games and got everything FOR FREE. Extra content like this has been a staple of video games for years now. Arkham City had a ton of day one DLC that was only available through per-order and no-one **** about that because it wasn't EA.

Electromatic,"There's no denying the fact that BioWare has created a truly vivid and unique world with the mass effect Universe, a galaxy composed of memorable and lovable characters that have drawn in fans all over of the world. Generally speaking, the majority of Mass Effect 3 was well paced, with emotional twists that seem to make the player truly care about the fates of all the characters around him/her. Yet the Ending seems to undermine all of that. It seems as though BioWare forgot the fact that the last two games took a more romanticized approach, that if the player sacrifices enough, whether it be by decisions alone, or by cranking out as many hours as possible on side quests, there's a chance for success, even if it has to be bittersweet. This concept failed to present itself at the end of ME3, which changed the whole concept of hope and brotherhood, which was a constant factor throughout the whole series. I don't believe that the ending deserved a ""they all lived happily ever-after"", but if enough reinforcements are gathered, a bittersweet ending with severe losses, and an epilogue would of added the needed closure to this trilogy.",3,2012-03-09,PLAYSTATION 3,user
UltraD00d,"Don't get me wrong, this game is playable and I'm sure if you had no standards or simply didn't care you could pick up this game and have a midly enjoyable experience. BUT the atrocities EA and Bioware committed mean I cannot give this game a decent rating with a good conscience. So what is so bad about this game? Let me tell you: 1. Day 1 DLC: Whether it was EA or Bioware (****, if you will) that decided to take this course I don't know, but releasing DLC on the day of release, particularly DLC which is important to the plot, at 1/6 the price of the game itself is unforgivable in of itself. It seems they are laughing in our face as we shell out money for something that should have been on the disc, available to everyone. It is obvious that it was done simply to milk as much money out of the fans as possible. 2. Casualisation: The game was geared towards Call of Duty players in order to cash in on the series' success, while abandoning the loyal fanbase. Not much else to say here. 3. Shoddy Writing: Many uninformed people think that the attacks on the Bioware employee Jennifer Hepler was simply a display of hate for the sake of hate. While they certainly did go overboard, it wasn't without good reason. She was the physical manifestation of the quality of writing coming from Bioware. Examples: Dialogue is awkward, the ending is notoriously bad, after seeing so many people die and killing so many himself, Sephard is emotianally effected by the death of a random kid above all. Overall you would expect something better from a Naruto fanfiction. 4. Laziness of Bioware: For a big budget, triple A game you would expect a certain level of effort from the developers. Bioware, however seemed to have taken shortcuts left, right and centre. There are images circulating the internet which demonstrate this quite well. For example, Copying a stock image for the portrait of a character who dies in the game, and copying another 7? year old image lying around in the internet for the ending. 5. Ininspired Multiplayer: Another cash-in, Wave survival modes have been done to death, nowadays every game seems to have one. It seems this was added in to artificially extend the life of the game and make an excuse for future half-assed DLC releases. 6. Gay Sex: people reading this may call 'Hurr durr homophobe"" - but wait to read my reasoning. Homosexuality IS a sin. Being implemented in such as fashion acts to 'casualise' it, pressing on the impressionable 13 year old minds (whose uninformed mothers will be buying this game) that it is fine and acceptable. I do not hate **** I care about them, just as I do any other person. For this reason I oppose it. Even if this is an attempt to cash-in with the gay audience rather than a political agenda, it gets in the way of the average straight player and does not belong. I do not want to have gay passes made to me by my squadmates when I'm playing a game. 7. Reviewers are sellouts: This goes for every major game release nowadays, but is absolutely appalling. While I'm not implying that EA is necessarily directly paying reviewers to give the game good reviews (not that I'd put it past them) there is certainly a feel that if you don't give it a good review the publisher early access to future releases. I have heard of cases where people have lost their job because they wrote how the felt rather than what they were told to write. This is why I'm writing this review in fact - to help get a bit of truth out. Instead of a proper, objective review we are fed tripe with 10/10 would play again bs. Due to all these aformentioned problems with Mass Effect 3, I cannot take it seriously, thus it receives a score of 0/10. The only reason it has earned a 1 from me is because the Biodrone tears are absolutely delicious. Have a good day sirs.",1,2012-03-09,PLAYSTATION 3,user
KRHamilton,"I just wasted over 50 hours in completing every quest and collecting all the war assets in preparation for an epic conclusion to my beloved Mass Effect adventures. However, the endings in this game totally ruined the experience for me. I was willing to forgive the removal of the holster button, the lack of a quest journal hotkey, the glitched animations, and the significant reduction of video logs (now most logs are just text). However, the ending has to be the most disappointing in the history of gaming for true fans of the series. I'm big on endings, they are crucial for my enjoyment of most forms of entertainment, games, movies, animated films, and novels. I don't expect every ending to be a happy one, but the endings in Mass Effect 3 has effectively killed this franchise. I'm a big fan of Mass Effect 1 and 2 (with the exception of planet scanning in part 2); I played through both games at least 5 times. Now I feel I also wasted hundreds of hours in those games to reach the disappointing conclusion in Mass Effect 3. I've already uninstalled Mass Effect 3 and will never play it again. It's sad to see how far Bioware has declined since they were purchased by EA in late 2007. EA is ruining every studio they acquire. If EA hadn't forced Bioware to add a multiplayer to Mass Effect 3 and if they had used a fraction of the money the spent on producing Hollywood blockbuster style trailers to improve the actual game, things would be very different. I also suspect that the Mass Effect series was terminated intentionally by EA Bioware to push fans of space operas to Star Wars Old Republic. However, I can't play that game because it is targeted at teenagers with its cartoonish graphics and combat. I'm in my late twenties, so I enjoy mature stories with realism; Mass Effect was one of the few science fiction game series that I enjoyed, but that is no longer the case. I will never buy another Bioware game until the breakway from EA. Unfortunately, I doubt that will happen. I'm also concerned with EA's anti-trust business practices and their threat to the game industry. In conclusion, I give this game a score of 1 for the parts of combat that were actually epic and for some the character dialogue that was enjoyable and not contrived. So I suggest you save your money; don't buy this game unless you don't care about endings.",1,2012-03-09,PLAYSTATION 3,user

AzrealSyn,"Though somewhat saddened by the conclusion, I cannot in good conscience give this game a 0 or 1 score just to ""get back"" at BioWare. Mass Effect 3 was an amazing game. Once I started, it was hard to stop before hours of my life flew by. After playing Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2 and all of the DLC I don't think I was ever more excited about playing a game as I was about Mass Effect 3. The story starts off quick and brutal. The tone set all the way to ""OMG WE ARE IN TROUBLE"" and it's up to Shepard to finish what he/she started. I will now review the various aspects of the game below, as well as my impressions of the PS3 version. Combat is fun. If you enjoyed the combat experience from ME2, then you will feel right at home here. Though some of the jumping and hurtling obstacles can be trial and error, the cover based system does what it's supposed to. Like all Mass Effect titles, you can command squadmates to use powers or ammo in fights to bring down challenging enemies. The level designs are mostly good with a few questionable design choices towards the end. Though, this game offered me some of the most intense battles in the series since my first encounter with a Thresher Maw in ME1. Graphics and voice acting are on par with previous games. A few bad apples are in the bunch but overall the voice acting is solid and the animations not overtly stiff. What really grabs you is the score and sound, which BioWare seemed to go all out on. When you encounter a Reaper up close and hear it's ""trumpet"" growl, you'll know what I mean. The engine is starting to look dated, but overall it is a beautiful game. Storywise, ME3 delivers for the most part. I will not spoil anything here. Some of the decisions from the previous titles could have been felt more but some resonate through the game. My only few gripes are the amount of dialogue choices seemed skimmed down to just your basic Paragon or Renegade options, not much middle ground here. And of course the conclusion, which I will not elaborate on because of spoilers. Problems with the game are few, but some are more noticeable then others. The Journal from the Start menu tracks all of your quests, but unlike ME1 and ME2, where the Journal tracked everything on three different tabs (Priority Missions, Side Missions and Completed Missions) ME3 decided to condense all of those into one tab and throw the Codex in there in place of tabs 2 and 3. AND, to top it off, the quests do not track status as it did in previous games. No grayed out objectives that have been completed under your current status **** mission. As a consequence to this, you have no idea what Side Missions you have the requires item to complete (they are all basically fetch ""quests"" more later), so you end up running around the Citadel to try and see what you have done or not. Your map is supposed to have a NavPoint (basically just says a person of interest is available in the area) to lead you to a completed side mission quest giver, but in my playthrough this was not always the case. And the way of picking up most side quests by basically eavesdropping as you rung by is also a little lackluster. Once you are used to it however, you adjust quickly and it does not ruin the overall experience. Now, for those wondering about the silly planet scanning mechanic from ME2, it's still there but not even close to how much time you spent doing it in ME2. When you enter a system, you will scan the area for EDI to find something of interest. If a planet lights up, you select it and then scan a la ME2, but only to guide the scanner to the white dot, exactly like how you found ""miscellaneous"" missions in ME2. You then send a probe and collect the reward. Rewards are everything from War Assets, Credits to Side Mission items. Most side missions are completed by collecting various items this way. Oh, and no Mako or Hammerhead missions either, so if you were not a fan of vehicle based missions, you are in luck. If you were, well ... sorry. War Assets, as mentioned above, are an important factor of ME3. To get ready for the final battle, Shepard is tasked with gathering as many forces, items and people possible for success. It adds a new element to the ME questing purpose and it sort of fun when you read about your progress on the War Asset Terminal. In short, the more you have, the better off you'll be in the last battle. Multiplayer. I only played a few hours of it and it is fun but not really my cup 'o tea. ME combat works well for the single-player campaign but in multiplayer, the sometimes clunky controls can be annoying. But the overall experience is fun. All I have on that since it was not the reason I bought the game anyway. Lastly, the PS3 version of the game played fine in most respects. The beginning was a little choppy but evened out quickly. Though I had 3 freezes which caused me to manually reset, the game played great otherwise.",9,2012-03-09,PLAYSTATION 3,user

Seriously? 3) Adding Multiplayer would have been quite good if the Single Player story lived up to the hype. But nooo, looks like money wins here. 4) Without spoiling anything i can honestly say this game has the worst ending than any other game which i have ever played.

However the ending and the last hour or so leading up to feel like they were written by someone with no understanding of how to truly write at all. Plot holes opening up all around you and with the endings ripped off from Deus Ex makes me wonder what exactly Bioware/EA were thinking when the final script was approved. The endings completely go against the spirit of the series and more than that they are all essentially the same my making every other choice up to that point completely null. I find it even more offensive that almost all of the RPG elements have become so watered down as to be unrecognisable. The conversation wheel which longtime fans of the series such as myself have come to know and love rarely shows up now. And even when it does all it offers is two ways to say the same thing. Even worse, your choices in the previous two make no really substantial difference in this entry either. Even the illusion of choice is gone. You almost don't get to converse with your crew at all. Instead your interaction is mostly limited to selecting them like you do with Zaeed Massani in ME2 and they talk a little bit while you just stand there. This becomes a big problem because ME3 throws in with no real introduction or background characters who are completely new or have only been featured in the Expanded Universe. I like the voice acting and appreciate that the world feels more alive now with background characters talking to one another when you walk by, that is when the sound doesn't drop out. It's unfortunate that the coders haven't learned anything, all the cut scene glitches are back in full force. Including the one where everyone uses the same assault rifle during the cut scene, regardless of whether or not they can even use one. It's nice to see all characters from the first two one last time, a little family reunion if you will. It's a shame that almost none of them will be joining your squad again. I do like the direction ground combat has taken though the removal of heavy weapons is another negative in my book. The day one DLC feels more like game content that was cut out rather than an actual add on. And having this nearly story essential DLC on day one is just plain greedy. Mostly though I just can't get around the endings. It feels like a punch in the gut to those of us who were big fans of the first two. It's so out of left field that I almost expect M. Night Shyamalan to be responsible for this travesty. It's almost like ending The Lord of the Rings with Frodo riding a nuke into Barad-dÃ»r with a cowboy hat on. I almost wish it would have been a Dallas-""It was all a dream"" ending.",0,2012-03-09,PLAYSTATION 3,user
bkp360,"It appears the people at BioWare forgot that first and foremost they are making entertainment. Ugly choices, steady personal loss and grief, and an ending which is, to say the least, horrific; left me feeling awlful. Like most I've anticipated this game and a return the ME universe. I wish I hadn't. I'll never go back there again. I could list all kinds of petty gripes such asI was faithful to Tali through ME1, 2 and 3 and I never got to see her face direct. Just a picture which is fine as she's hot but never that personal experience of looking directly at her... You get the idea. But these could all be forgiven if the story was satisfying but it wasn't even close. And aside from a few references to prior games and a few side plots playing out there was little sense of ME1 or ME2 affecting this game much.

dobserver,"I read a lot of the ratings posted by others and realized that a lot of the low ratings are because of the DLC. I generally don't pay for additional DLC content, but other reviewers suggested that it the content has a somewhat large impact on the story, which suggests that Bioware should have included it in the original game. That being said, the rating of the game shouldn't be deducted just because of this. This game feels very similar to Mass Effect 2. The ship, the interactions with people and even the way you travel around the world. In some ways, I think its more like an expansion than a full game. This being said, I am not yet finished the game so this is based on what I've played so far. The combat system has been suuped up. There are specific classes to specialize in which gives special abilities, which allows you to fight how you want to. This customization is definitely an improvement to the old game. The voice acting is pretty good, very similar to mass effect 2 (which was also very good) The cinematics are not bad, and the game does focus on these more than actual gameplay. Gameplay seems to have lost some depth. I can't comment on the story yet, but it seems to build on the story lore that mass effect 2 first explored. (I didn't play mass effect 1). The music and sound are pretty good. They match the cinematics and game play very well. Overall, the game isn't revolutionary. But there are improvements from Mass Effect 2. However, I feel the depth in story telling of Mass Effect 2 was better, but will see how it goes on as I continue the game...",8,2012-03-08,PLAYSTATION 3,user
halo_on,"Mass Effect 3 suffers from two major mistakes made by Bioware's game directors and I'm starting to notice an unfortunate trend in their sequels. The first problem is that ME3 plays like Dragon Age 2. Both games were rushed to market and seem to ignore what the fans loved most about the first title. The second issue is the addition of a multiplayer component to the game. It obviously detracted from time spent on the overall quality of the game. Todd Howard, game director for Skyrim put it beautifully when asked why Bethesda didn't include a cooperative feature in their latest Elder Scrolls game: ""We always look into multiplayer, put lots of ideas on the whiteboard, and it always loses. It's not that we don't like it. I can think of ways it would be a lot of fun, but at the end of the day, that dev[eloper] time is going to take away from doing the best single-player game we can, and that's where our hearts are.""

Fbh,"Of what I've played so far the game is quite good. I'm liking the story, characters and the new aditions they made to the gameplay. On one side it's a great game and, IMO, a great final chapter for one of the most important IPs of this console generation. Then, why a 5???. Because performance **** on Ps3 with no real reason for it and there are hundreds of people complaining and bioware won't even respond us. Most cinematics run at 20 fps and when there is a lot of action it can even drop to 15. Gameplay runs a bit smoother but does also have constant drops to 20fps which have been confirmed (by digital foundry) to produce controller input lag. Having the game run so badly interferes with the enjoyment of the story and gameplay and that just can't be there on a game I payed 60 bucks for like everyone else. Yes, the Ps3 hardware is hard to work with and yes the Unreal engine was built with the Xbox and PC in mind, but If you can't pull off your game on the hardware, then don't release it, that's just how it is. So if you are in the lucky situation to be ablte to choose on which system to get this game, don't get it for Ps3. And even if Ps3 is your only gaming system, I ask and recommend you to wait a bit and get an used copy. Sadly, this people won't care about the consumer until it starts hurting their wallet.

Avidita,"To those of you who reviewed this on March 6, 2012 - How can you make a fair and educated rating of the game without having played it? I for one, am in love with this game. I'm about 30 hours through now, and I don't see the end any time soon, which says a lot in terms of amount of gameplay in comparison to other releases nowadays. In addition - I have never cried as many times, or as hard, as I have while playing this game. Sure, some of the dialogue is hokey at times, but the way BioWare designed this game definitely instills you with a feeling of ""Wow, this is really the end."" That being said, my only complaint about the game thus far is that I feel as though Cerberus is the main enemy, not the Reapers. That being said, there are some things that allude to the latter, but I will not mention them here because of spoilers.",9,2012-03-08,PLAYSTATION 3,user
IcarusLives,"As usual, every single butthurt moron who calls themselves ""fans"" is complaining and shredding this game to pieces, much like the other Bioware games, but the fact is this. This is one of the best games to come out in this console generation. I've seen people comparing it to Skyrim, and saying that Skyrim is better, but it isn't. In Mass Effect 3, everything feels important. Everything you do has some end goal. In Skyrim, your side quests feel like nothing but filler, to make the game appear ""grand"" in scale. Bioware has done it again. They remain one of the top developers to ever bless our consoles, and Mass Effect 3 is not only GOTY contender, but GOTD (decade).",10,2012-03-07,PLAYSTATION 3,user

ParagonRenegade,"One of the better games I've played in the last decade; Mass Effect 3 improves on the other preceding titles in virtually all manners barring some subjective ways others may deem inaccurate or useless. To explain: The combat is much better and smoother, conversations are more realistic and just in general top-notch, the characters both new & old are vastly improved, voice acting (especially from Mark Meer) is vastly superior and the emotion runs high in the story throughout. Most importantly, the story is much better than Mass Effect 2's, although it falls short (barely) of Mass Effect 1. I strongly suggest buying it for these reasons alone, but there is more... The multiplayer, which is unexpected to say the very least, had me underwhelmed when I first saw it disclosed, but when I played the demo, and now in the retail, I have grown to see it as an integral component to the game and like the rest of it is of massive quality. The supplementary ""Galaxy at War"" is also interesting, if underdeveloped, and I would like to see it improved in future DLC. Lastly, I should mention what I found to be bad: -Animations when taking cover can sometimes glitch and freeze characters or make them look lifeless (i.e. you have full control but while on the wall they don't breath etc) -Some old friends in the textures popping up; this is rare, and happens almost universally after you finish an N7 mission. -I would have liked if it was more difficult, it's easy (to an extent) for a gamer of my skill (Average, possibly slightly above-average). -A few plot holes, easily forgivable given their minimal impact/enjoyable repercussions Other than those small gripes, the game is outstanding, and is well worth the price of the retail and even the Collector's edition; if you own an Xbox or PC (I do not recommend for Playstation due to lack of Mass Effect 1) you owe it to yourself to play -experience- Mass Effect 3 for yourself. Don't listen to the 10's who blindly love the game, or the reds/0's who give their gripes with EA/Bioware/DLC as reasons for hate, carefully evaluate what the critics say and compare it with a rental or a purchase; I promise you will not regret it.",9,2012-03-07,PLAYSTATION 3,user
Rubenh,"Painful. I loved the Mass Effect saga, but this installment utterly ruins it. It's an insult to gamers worldwide. Bioware approaches the story telling as if they are attempting to make a brain damaged turtle comprehend. Consequently, it is HIGHLY flawed, simplistic and lacking. An awful result. Addtionally, they have taken a break from anything that made the previous installments interesting and unique(choice-based storytelling; intriguing plot turns; emotional commitment) and replaced it with blatantly ostentatious cinematics that would only impress the aforementioned ''turtle-minded''. It's not just a shame, it's an insult. Bioware has gravely insulted and disappointed me by ruining what used to be such a great story. Don't go look for it and don't buy it.

thejackolantern,"I have been following 'Mass Effect' since the first game, and have been a supportive fan of the series. The game has corrected several of the animations and included multi-player, but has failed in so many other ways to sadden me to only be able to rate it a '3'. First and foremost, it seemed the MP content was more important than developing the story from the previous games, specifically the completely glossing over of 'Mass Effect 2'. The strength of any trilogy is the ability to draw all the pieces of storyline together, which ME3 did not accomplish. Secondly, the entire genre is space opera, which means that even if developers felt the endings provided were necessary, they should have included additional alternatives. The endings I feel are a large part of my problem with game 3. Third, while the idea of creating a smaller squad may appeal from logistics, the fact is, many players like the characters that were introduced previously, and have great attachments to them. By limiting their roles, and in some cases eliminating them all-together except for 'walk-on' parts, the game effectively eliminates the level of characterization we've all enjoyed. The game is bleak, the endings are bleaker, and the real issue is the apparent lack of concern that EA/BioWare has with its player base, especially console players. I cannot stress this enough: 'Mass Effect 3' feels more like an solid attempt to garner MP rather than a successful sequel and ending to a series, and it falls short of that. In some ways, the feel of ME3 is very similar to Dragon Age 2, and that's not necessarily a good thing. Could DLC correct my rating? **** I'd have to pay for the mistakes made in storytelling, design, and glitches. I'm not sure that is appropriate from a game which has been eagerly anticipated by players and fans, myself included. I think for now however, I sadly must only rate ME3 a 3, good attempt, but by no means the game it needs to be.",3,2012-03-07,PLAYSTATION 3,user

aspentitan,"Why a 5 Rating? Let's talk about this logically. First off DLC on day one. What does this mean? This means EA is mad about something and they need to settle a debt with their players or customers who buy their games. This shows a complete lack of respect or EGO on EA's part. My translation is EA is mad at customers who buy second hand. Well I wonder why players do that when on day one you cannot trust you bought a complete game without software bugs. I mean come on you expect gamers to trust you when you sell DLC on day one integral to the games plot? I give a cautionary 5 rating to the game because you broke the game with this. From here you can infer that in the future you will now release a GOTY edition with the downloadable content for $30 or less. Well I can wait making this day one release at full price a waste of money. EA, you will not win this battle if you want to claim $60 you have to be respectful of you fan/customer base and provide a solid product as with any company. You need our revenue or you will not exist. I do not need your games they are only entertainment and their are lots of games and companies products to choose from. EA look at all the zero scores and do some research on that you are making tons of people very angry. You provide broken or incomplete products then wonder why people buy used. Just have some respect, make a good game, test it, make it flawless, make it worth the money and people will buy it at full price. Make junk and of course no one wants to spend a lot of hard earned money on it. It this game good, probably yes but I'm not paying twice for one game. I'm waiting til the game implodes on you and you put out the DLC on one disc and you will get $30 from me, half the revenue you would have got for not playing your silly trickery with DLC on day one. Just bad business in my humble opinion. Don't forget on ps3 mass effect one does not exist and on DLC is only provided in PS3 mass effect 2. Why did you not provide the same on Xbox 360. Funny that both systems have lack of full game import leading up to mass effect 3. Well you choose to shaft your gamers, now their turn back, look at all the negative zero scores.

oatzsquatz,"PROS: - Shiny new cutscenes - Wonderful Clint Mansell soundtrack - Better combat, particularly melee (plays like the melee in Dragon Age 2, one button does everything), improved powers - Smarter enemy AIs CONS: - One button does everything in combat - Ridiculously **** dialogue - Forces sexuality into everything (I could give concrete examples, but I may give away spoilers). I will say this much: EDI, and, this small segment of dialogue: Shepherd: I hope you're alright, Kaiden Kaiden: Are you flirting with me, Commander? This is literal dialogue and not a joke - Rubbish, rubbish, dialogue. Cringe worthy. Nearly all the time. Some characters do save the ****show, like Garrus. - They actually used a voice changer (blatantly obvious) to use less voice actors (if you don't believe me, once you get to the Citadel you will be able to hear it) - Rehashed animations from the last game (lack of innovation) -Filters, filters everywhere -Cheap emotional pulls and attempts at emotional manipulation EVERYWHERE. It's like they used this to replace bad writing. - SEVERELY LIMITED DIALOGUE OPTIONS. If I wanted to play a shooter, I would have. Two dialogue options? Most dialogues with no options whatsoever? Poor show. -Totally retconns the lore established in the previous games Overall this game shows a shocking lack of attention to detail and blatantly ignores what the fans wanted (contrary to what the developers claim all the time. No one wanted this). The voice acting is stiff and so is the animation. Complete lack of innovation and the only thing they improved was the fighting - to add to this, they even used well-known stock images as some of their sources and the copies are glaring - look up ""winter on mars"" and you should see what I mean, if you've beaten the game. They force sexuality on the player, and if you reject it then the characters hate yours. This series has ended on a bad note. For fans of the series, it **** majorly.

Apotts,"Do yourself a favor and ignore the negative reviews that come from angry haters who have not played this game. The User score has more to do with anger about DLC and does not fairly reflect what this game has to offer. I picked up this game yesterday morning, put it in my system and spent the entire day with a giant smile on my face. The game is that good! It felt wonderful to be back in the Normandy, surrounded by old friends as well as new faces. If you enjoyed the first two games, you will have a hard time not enjoying this game... well... unless you are one of those gamers who can't handle change, and if that is the case enjoy your bitterness. Things to know that might help you decide if you want this game: 1) A lot of the negativity comes from the Day1 DLC ($10 cost), fans feel the DLC was pulled from the full game and sold separately to unfairly make a profit. After playing the DLC mission I have to agree that the DLC should have been part of the game, or at the very least it should have been cheaper. This was one of the first missions I played, and although I suppose you can do without it, I really felt it was an important part of the story. On the other hand after getting the Prothean character I have yet to be able to bring him along on a mission, for some reason he is blacked out every time. Not sure why that is, but I suppose he will unlock later on in the game, like Sebastian did in DA2, but after paying $10 extra for a character I would kinda like the option to bring him along on every mission if I should so chose. 2) The game feels more combat focused with less focus on exploration. One of the great things about the first 2 ME games was the feeling that you were on an amazing adventure and the whole galaxy was yours to discover. So far ME3 seems very limited in exploration, but I am still early into the story, so perhaps that will change. I really hope that will change, but I am starting to wonder. 3) Weapon system... kinda confusing. They keep changing this, and I am never really sure why. I was lost the first few times that I tried to equip a new weapon, maybe it is just me, but I found it very confusing and ended up accidentally missing out on opportunities to equip new weapons during the first mission. Once you get control of the ship though you are able to play with this and figure out what you need to know, but I was somewhat put off by this. 4) No more hacking. ME 1 & 2 had you doing little puzzles to hack doors and safes, and ME3 has done away with that chore. I think this was a good move, since hacking got boring after a while, but if you are someone who likes the hacking this might be missed. 5) For those people who have not played the first two games, I would recommend playing them first. I suppose you can jump into the story with ME3, but I think much of the story will be lost on you. Plus the wow moments would probably be a lot less wow if I didn't know the back story.",10,2012-03-07,PLAYSTATION 3,user

You can customize your weapons more so than the previous game, and shooting bad guys feels much more satisfying in this game than in the past games. Heart breaking decisions, your squad could be gone at any moment. The writing is as good as ever. Take a chance on this game.",10,2012-03-06,PLAYSTATION 3,user

Slaw,At time of writing a major feature of this game(the ability to carry over your character from a previous game) does not function. The vast majority will play this game to continue the story with THEIR character making it arguably the most important feature in the game. How this made it through QA or was never tested is beyond rational thought. This is tantamount to selling something you cannot deliver.,1,2012-03-06,PLAYSTATION 3,user
parrisgg,"I really liked the game. It feels quite a bit like ME2 to be honest though, the combat mechanics really have not changed very much. I was disappointed because I wanted to see a bit more, but nonetheless, I still love the game. I actually traded in terrible mw3 to get this game and I have no regrets doing it, I know I will playing the game for a while from now and attempt to get every trophy possible. One aspect I do not like is that the game is not entirely free world, the maps are somewhat small but still, how could you make space an open world because this is not SWTOR. I would recommend this game to anyone, although I would read up on the previous games if you have not played any of the others.",9,2012-03-06,PLAYSTATION 3,user

Yasuchika,"I feel awfully betrayed that the series went from and expansive sci-fi space opera with consequential choices; to a fairly streamlined action adventure with RPG elements. Its attempts at emotional manipulation are slightly hamfisted, not ineffective but very clumsily implemented and unrelated to my character's background - which I imagine Bioware has forgotten about at this point. The writing and designs for some characters also seems out of place, Vega is expected to be a bulky man but not to the extent that he's a jersey Shore cast member, the addition of Jessica Chobot and redesign for Ashley also complement this lovely little tan-orange motif. My largest qualm is with the Day 1 DLC - which I strongly oppose - by all means create new characters that are not plot-integral. But when you create a squad member who is heaily tied to the universe's lore and mystique and then aim to charge an extra $10 for it on top of the game's already hefty pricetag you know you fit a **** romance system is fine, although I'd like to be able to talk to my companions without the intention of making out with them.

While the first one was a little rough around the edges, the second was perfect. Three however, is too far. In terms of visuals, they are too dark, made to look like the current CoD games.

HelpTheBurgers,"Bioware made 2 fantastic games in Mass Effect and Mass Effec 2 where you controlled Commander Shepard. Your Shepard. In Mass Effect 3 Bioware has taken the commander back. Many choices from the first 2 games have minimal changes with some flat out retconned. The dialogue is gone, even with full decisions on it's like watching a movie instead of an interactive story. Add in mandatory DLC for the ""best"" possible on day 1 and what you get is a game that spits in the face of fans of the first 2 installments and ruins what should have been the best triology of games in the past decade",0,2012-03-06,PLAYSTATION 3,user
me-0815,"Mass Effect 1 was an exciting, innovative new type of Action-RPG. It had an epic story in a unique, diverse universe, very good writing, great characters and real choices for the player. Little is left of that. In their desire to cater to the fans of shooters and casual games, BioWare has reduced the RPG elements, trivialized the dialogue and taken away much of the character development and choices that make a proper RPG. The story that started in Mass Effect 1 as an interesting and mystic space opera has been transformed into a predictable soap opera with mostly mediocre, sometimes outright terrible, writing. It might still be better than most of the other stories in video games these days, but that's of course not very difficult, and it's nowhere near the quality that BioWare used to deliver. Probably the worst example of the inability of the writers are the endings. On the other hand, perhaps they too were imposed by EA, to reduce the required work and costs. One complaint against Mass Effect 1 was the somewhat uninspired combat system. This had already been replaced in Mass Effect 2 with a clone of the usual cover-based shooters. Not very innovative and in my opinion still quite repetitive and not very challenging, but many players seemed to enjoy it. So in that regard, Mass Effect 3 certainly delivers the expected. But that's of course not nearly enough to make it a great game, and it's also not the reason why I play BioWare games or RPGs in general.",0,2012-03-06,PLAYSTATION 3,user

BEEFLASER,"EA claimed that free, day-one DLC for new owners and online passes were meant to reclaim revenue ""lost"" to used sales. I never really agreed with those tactics; if EA thinks used sales are a problem, they should persuade the consumer to buy their games new, not twist their arms. However, it was never about used sales, it was about control. Their enemy isn't just the aftermarket, it's consumer choice, and the way they handle DLC for ME3 proves that. If you don't pay extra for the deluxe edition of Mass Effect 3, you have to shell out ten bucks ON DAY ONE for what seems like significant and interesting portion of single-player content for the game. New, used, doesn't matter, if you didn't spend extra up front, they'll juts try to squeeze it out of you later. EA are extremely anti-consumer, and as much as I love Mass Effect I'm glad they won't be able to use the series to bend me over a barrel any more.

As someone who has been a fan of their games from Baldur's Gate to Dragon Age: Origins, seeing how far they have fallen has been a painful experience. Writing has deteriorated to the most basic black and white, with most dialogues presenting only 2 options rather than 3. As was feared the series ends with a Deus Ex Machina (quite literally as the ending was almost entirely stolen from the game Deus Ex). Further evidence plagiarism of a desktop wallpaper of all things in the game's FINAL SCENE does not help Bioware's case. The whole thing seems like it was rushed with little care about the game's quality, as if they expected people to buy it automatically no matter how bad it was (and I'm sure they do). Creativity seems truly dead from that studio at this point. Do not buy this game. No not rent it, do not waste the bandwidth of pirating it.

There is also a huge lack of polish, animations are absolutely terrible and glitchy. voice acting is unbelievably bad, the lead writer, Mac Walters, is f*cking crap at his job and should be sacked. Graphics are very low quality. Skyboxes are a joke to look at, just a muddy pixelated mess Iooks more at home in the original Half-Life1, low res textures are buried under excessive amounts of shadow and poor contrast settings that can't be changed, space bar does EVERYTHING. Choices in the past game mean almost nothing, which is contrary to what was advertised. And now, the autodialog. Shepard just talks for ages on end, with absolutely no input from the player. This isn't YOUR Shep you play, it is something else. Shep often says **** things I didn't want him to, so and there's only 2 choices of dialog now, not 3-4 from the previous games.

SuperkenGaming,"Mass Effect 3 Legendary Edition Go google pictures of Mirandas butt Mass Effect 3 is the final chapter of Sheards story youre off to end the reapers, this race of beings that threaten the existence of the universe as you know it… I didn’t play the original version, but here in Mass Effect 3 you have the option to play RPG style or action style… as someone that played the last 2 games I love the choice aspect of this series so I chose to mainline the story with the rpg elements here.. choosing my dialog.. unfortunately though the game doesn’t make it hard for you to just b line to the end in about 12 hours. Why? Because this just ist the least interesting game in the trilogy.. it just is.. you already know which charcters you like in this universe.. and there aren’t really anymore to fall in love with before the big showfdown.. so I just didn’t care to do the side missions, especially with just how repetitive the main campaign felt.. why would i? I had no insentive to explore and go do more.. that being said mass Efect 3 is decently enjoyable to play through.. You will get more squadmembers as the story goes on, youll be picking out their special abilities, and they do become an important part of your arsenal.. for example Liara was a stple for me to deal with annoying shielded enemies, I loved how on command I could have her just throw any enmy in the eir right in front of me.. so it really is up to you to baance your squad of 3 to your play style.. I do wish however there was more information given to me before a mission s maybe I was more throughful about the 2nd member… if I ever had anyone different it was mostly because the tory forced it on me.. in general mass effect 3 does an awful job at pre gaming… you have to chose your loadout before you go in.. having no idea what youll be dealing with ahead of time.. it makes literally 0 sense for me to not change my loadout based on my current situation on the fly… it ultimately lead to me not relly trying out any guns after I had one I was pretty satisfied… If mass Effect 3 werent the bow ontop of a series I had to see the end of after a huge investment into 1 and 2… I probably wouldn’t have been so invested to see it through.. it lies on the shoulders of the success of the perevious games and sadly doesn’t live up to the world building standards they set… While I did enjoy going through this campaign and putting an end to this intergalactic war… by itself, mass effect 3 isnt all that great.

TheExtraGuy,"The two things that bring the Wii U version down is the fact that EA didn't even think to release the Trilogy along with this game, and they didn't even support this release with the rest of the DLC that came out for the other 3 platforms. I don't really have to mention the ending as I think everyone is well aware of it, but that's not the reason I gave it a 6. If you love the series like I do, you'll want to have this game on the Wii U just because it's the first Mass Effect game on a Nintendo system. Despite all the annoyances I have with the story not really being my own and a lot of the plot points I would have controlled in previous games just being waved off and unchangeable even with the interactive comic... I still enjoy the story! It's also the exact same gameplay as the other versions just with an added gamepad touch (pun sort of intended). It's used as a map screen mostly with a few hot keys and you can command your squad to take cover not the best use for it but you won't find it's functions on 360, PS3 or PC. I played mostly with the Pro Controller so I didn't utilise the gamepad that much. Speaking about the gamepad however, have you ever wanted to play Mass Effect 3 in bed? It's quite the experience lol You see, the gamepad does have it's brilliant uses. The online mode is somewhat baron and almost as dead as disco, you'll be searching for games for a long time unless you try to start one yourself and hope to god somebody joins, also I live in Australia so the lag was terrible as most of the servers I tried to join were in Europe. The multiplayer is fun for a bit but it gets repetitive and it feels really out of place for a game that's really a story driven experience more than anything. Sometimes it can get difficult as to where you can take cover without getting slaughtered, so it does get a little annoying when you can't find a place to take cover and you're constantly getting killed because you think you've found good cover but then an enemy decides to sneak up on you. Overall, not a horrid game at all, but it aint perfect. It's still the same executive meddled ME3 we all know. But as a Mass Effect fan who hates EA, I'm glad I have it in my collection, but I am pissed off that I can't play as the Shepard that I want and I can't stop my evil clone and have a party in my Citadel apartment with my crew!",7,2014-11-03,WII U,user
MisterShmi,"I will never forgive EA for rushing the development of this game. It pains to think about what could have been. On top of it all, they screwed over Wii U owners. What would have clearly been the definitive version is held back by a horrible comic that omits any sort of control over the events of the first 2 games. On top of it all, they will never release 1 and 2 because EA likes to screw over Nintendo fans at every possible avenue. However, I still give this game a 10 because in spite of its rushed development, this game is darn near perfection. Several of the most emotionally provocative moments in video game history are all in this game. I've never experienced such a grand storyline on such an epic scale. Thank you BioWare for the ride. I absolutely enjoyed every minute of it up until the end.

xxjerm70xx,There is not much difference from the others but if your wanting a third party game that you can play for a long time to the point of wearing it out Mass Effect 3 does it purpose! The game pad is better used as a screen to play on. From Ashes DLC and Javik is what you would expect from DLC for a RPG. Star Trek fans should have no problems getting into the story.

AwkwardTurtle42,"Mass Effect 3 on the Wii U is a good port and runs pretty well. The downside is that the first two games aren't available on the Wii U which means players are missing out on two-thirds of the story and a lot of the DLC. It's still a good game on its own but it feels a bit like catching the last few episodes of a TV series, the episodes might be good on their own but it's just a whole lot better if you start from the beginning. It also includes the ""Genesis 2"" interactive comic which is a quick recap of the main storyline in Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2. It's nice that they tried to get players up to speed with the story and not just put Mass Effect 3 onto the Wii U anyway, but turning a 40 hour game into a 10 minute comic means that unfortunately a lot of things do get missed out. Considering that Mass Effect Trilogy was released on PS3, Xbox 360 and PC at the same time as ME3 launched on the Wii U and for the same price, the ""Special Edition"" doesn't really feel all that special.

TheQuietGamer,"I played this game back when it first came out on Xbox 360. It's one of my favorite games of all time, and also one of the few games I've ever given a perfect 10/10. This port is the exact game game with the previously released DLC already installed on the disc. It's got the same fantastic campaign and awesome multiplayer, but there are a few key issues that keep this Wii U port from being the ""Special Edition"" that the title would have you believe. Most issues are little and due to the fact that EA and Bioware aren't giving this port the backing they are giving the PS3 and 36o versions. This means no DLC or patch support, the latter of which causes this port to have many bugs and glitches, mostly in the multiplayer portion of this game. But by far the biggest issue that keeps me from recommending the Wii U version over other ports is that Mass Effect 1 and 2 aren't available on the Wii U. This strips this version of one of the biggest and best part of ME 3; the ability to import you decisions from previous game to influence how the game plays out. They tried to make up for this by giving this version a digital comic that covers over the previous two games stories and lets you make some of the bigger story decisions. The problem with this is that the comic gives you no sort of context as to why they are important or how they will effect the game. Also you're not building relationships with the fantastic characters Bioware has crafted over these 3 games, so a lot of ME 3's more emotional moments are lost on the player. So as you can see you're better off buying ME 3 for a system with access to the entire trilogy to feel the full effect ME 3 can offer, especially since you can probably get the entire trilogy for the same price or cheaper than this Wii U port. However if the Wii U is the only video game system you own, then this is still a must play regardless of its faults. The campaign still has one of the best stories in video game history, sci-fi or otherwise. It's also packed with intense firefights, tough decisions, and fantastic characters. It will keep you busy for many hours, and the multiple endings will keep you coming back. The multiplayer is also fantastic, combining co-operative gameplay, with multiple character classes and races, as well as many difficulties. So if you have the option I do recommend picking up ME 3 on another system wit the entire trilogy, but like I said before if the Wii U is your only video game system then this is still a game you need to play.",8,2013-09-08,WII U,user
scorched595,"Nope, even with all of the dlc and patches, this game still ****. There isn't much to say that hasn't been said already, the gameplay is gears of war lite with broken controls, the story in this particular chapter is atrociously written, the new squadmates **** and the ending still ****. Not to be rude, but anyone who rates this highly clearly hasn't had much experience with good RPG's, or good shooters for that matter, because this game **** on both fronts, it has poor narrative, and the gameplay **** so hard that it could **** a golf ball through a garden hose.",0,2013-06-13,WII U,user
Francisalex,"Mass Effect 3 is a great addition to the Wii U library, specially because it was available since launch. It definitely keeps all the essence of the other versions and adds some interesting features through the Wii U GamePad. It's really sad that some of the DLC is not included on this version, which does not make it so special as the title suggests, but it's still Mass Effect 3, a definite must-buy for the Wii U",9,2013-02-02,WII U,user
Asonic3582,"Mass Effect has arrived in style for Wii U. Many fans have enjoyed this series on other platforms and Mass Effect 3 shows what it's all about. In addition to the main game, there's the new gamepad functionality with a convenient map for ordering allies and your special powers and some of the DLC on the other consoles is included for free. The game truly deserves a 10 but as much as I hate to say it 3 key factors hold this version back. 1. Wii U players have no access to the first 2 games resulting in a comic to catch players up on the story, while it gets the job done its not the same as playing 1 and 2 on the system. 2. Any DLC for the other platforms besides the content that's on the disc will not be available on Wii U. 3. ME3 on Wii U is the full $60 on Wii U but other platforms have it around $30 now (and the whole trilogy for $60). None of that changes the fact that this game is amazing and if the Wii U is your weapon of choice for gaming defiantly pick it up.",9,2013-01-11,WII U,user
theAngryGameCri,"The WIi U version is great - the reason it has 6.1 is probably due to all the XBOTS / PS Drones. It runs a lot smoother - it's a great experience, and the WIi U gamepad functionality really adds a new dimension to the game which I (now realised) that I lacked on the 360 version and PS3. Unfortunately, the Wii U gamepad functionality isn't as great as I would have hoped - but it's still a superior version to the others. I felt they could have added a lot more, but there is a lot of untapped potential. However, this is to be expected from a launch port - future iterations are most probably going to utilise the gamepad a lot better. However, from a game perspective, it's as great as it's always been. The ending left a bit to be desired, but the whole gameplay experience more than made up for it.",10,2012-12-23,WII U,user
yolandivisser,"It's absurd that this has a 5.8. It's better on wiiu than both the mainstream consoles. It's smoother in both graphics and controls. Everything else is the same, and since it scores so well on other consoles I smell industry buy-off corruption *******. Get this damn game!",10,2012-12-17,WII U,user
McSkittle,"Mass Effect 3 Special Edition was made for the Wii U engine. For all you Star Wars noobs you will appreciate controls. It is sad that developers are not using the Nintendo eShop for on-line content. Also I want wii motion plus controls it is epic for third Person games. Also it would be nice if Mass Effect 3 had better replayability,",8,2012-12-01,WII U,user
AdamAFD,Runs so much faster than the other two. Loads more fun and only on one disc. Graphics are much smoother and framerates only lag sometimes. This game shows you what the wii u is capable of and I cant wait to see what it brings us!,10,2012-11-28,WII U,user
ubergeekzilla,"a fantastic game. with the new extended cut mass effect 3 ends the trilogy in a great way. its epic, exciting, dramatic, its equally as good as mass effect 2. the only negatives are the journal system **** **** the gamepaly, characters, graphics, everything is top notch. the best game of 2012 and one of the best games ever overall",10,2012-11-22,WII U,user
timbers_WSU,"This game is exactly the same as the 360/PS3 counterparts with a few exceptions. The frame rate runs smoother than the PS3 version I have but the color looks off. As in it looks good but looking side by side some parts of the level looks different on the Wii U. Not bad, just different. The Wii Pad is not really put to good use here and is mainly for inventory purposes and it kind of **** not getting 1 and 2 on the Wii U. The biggest problem is EA has the audacity to change $60 for this when you can get the trilogy on other platforms for the same price. Really EA? And you can't figure out why no one likes you. I can't hate on the game too bad and feel I should rate the game on its own merit, and they at least added a 20 minute comic at the beginning to catch Wii U owners up on the story. But EA has been doing a lot of stupid things lately so I am docking 3 points. The game itself is a 9. But for the price you are better off getting it on another system. But if all you have is a Wii U, then by all means.....Pick it up.",7,2012-11-21,WII U,user
