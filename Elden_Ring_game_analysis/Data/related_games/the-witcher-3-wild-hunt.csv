horitoshi,"Легендарная игра, которую я, к сожалению, так и не пройду. Вроде и графика хорошая, и сеттинг великолепный, и персонажи живые, да и вроде сюжет ничего такой, но меня эта игра абсолютно не завлекает. Интереса в неё играть - 0, хоть иногда желание снова попробовать Ведьмак время от времени появляется. В общем, игра не для всех, но фанатам фэнтези советую.",8,2025-03-13,PC,user
fxckben,"I round up to a 10. I love this game. It has almost everything i want from a RPG game. Only things that are bothering me are: Combat I dont hate it but i dont really like it on harder difficulties its kinda fun, Pacing of the last half especially the quest with the assassination of radovid and the plot with the white frost, too many unrewarding question marks in the water in skellige and lastly that i want more content :'(. There never been a game that brought about such a big void in one after completing it. My favourite Parts about the game were: Velen and Novigrad as areas i love the atmosphere, the story with the side quest connected to it such as the baron one, the characters and kaer morhens landscape. Lastly the DLC are superb pls dont overlook them, Heart of Stone has probably the best writing i have ever witnessed in gaming and Blood and Wine is a beatiful end to geralts story.",10,2025-03-09,PC,user

Shadow2131,"Игра захватывает своим сюжетом, а возможность на него влиять впечатляет еще больше. Особенной изюменкой являются многочисленные отсылки именно к славянской мифологии, которую не часто встретишь в играх. Удивительно, но даже спустя 10 лет графика не выглядит устаревшей, а временами даже поражает. Саундтрек настолько запоминается, что хочется слушать его даже отдельно от игры.

ethancote98,"Even though it came out in 2015, The Witcher 3 remains one of the best RPGs ever made. The storytelling, side quests, and immersive world are still top-tier. If you've never played it, the updated version with enhanced graphics makes it even better",8,2025-02-27,PC,user

SouthOfBalmora,"""Hatred and prejudice will never be eradicated, and witch hunts will never be about witches."" This is the only game ever made that I would give a 10/10. It's not perfect (as no game is) but it's so close to perfection that any other score would be a disservice. This is one of very few games that deserve the title ""masterpiece"" - a journey so epic it's daunting to look back on it and consider the fact that all of that happened in the same game. Countless memorable characters, amazing quests, insane visuals, great music, atmosphere so thick you could cut it with a silver sword, and so many iconic lines that it feels like the script writers must have included everything they've previously saved for their upcoming magnum opus. Considering when it came out, who made it and what their backgrounds were - not to mention the resources they made it with - this game SHOULD have been impossible, but they did it anyway. And that doesn't even mention the DLC expansions; both of them are better than the majority of full-fledged games, with characters, storylines, settings and such variation that it puts everything else in the world of gaming to shame. Back in 2015, I remember telling myself ""I would be able to boot up this game in 10 years and still be impressed."" That has proven to be true, and something tells me the same thing will apply in another decade. Like I mentioned, it's not perfect. Roach is incredibly annoying, the controls can be funky (especially in tight spaces), the minimap's GPS can rarely be trusted, and occasionally the animations during conversations can be a bit stiff. But all of this feels like nitpicking, and are dwarfed when compared to the game as a whole. As far as I'm concerned, Wild Hunt is the peak of gaming, and question is if anything will ever be made that could rival it. I'd like to believe so, but the longer I play, the more I doubt it. There's only room in the world for so many miracles.",10,2025-01-11,PC,user

This was and will always be one of my top 3 games, one of the only games I can go back to every year or two. The choices and dialogue are what really sell it for me though. Everything is well written even contracts and side quests, there are so many formulas to find and weapons/armor to make. Probably the most unique bestiary in any game, every inch of this game was made with love. It is not perfect of course, but it's still a 10 in my book.",10,2024-11-29,PC,user
jazoritan,"It was a great game. Being the only decent looking male character felt amazing. Heard the game sticks to the lore of the books. Almost every women in temeria were pretty with bo0bs displayed here and there and they were always down to have some with Gerald. I don't know about the books but every male humans in game must have puffy cheeks and be chinless, looking somewhat deformed lorewise. Geralt can only have straight romance but other aspects of his personality can be changeable by choices in game. Game had a long playtime prolonged by some extra steps in every quests. Like that math exam that has only 3 questions but it turns out to be 1.a, 1.b... 3.a, 3.b, 3,c,3.d,3.f,......3.j etc. It was exciting with pages of dialogues.

This game represents the peak of the Witcher franchise, delivering an expansive, intricately crafted world filled with meaningful choices and complex, memorable characters. The story is rich and captivating, with Geralt’s journey feeling as personal as it is epic.What sets The Witcher 3 apart is its seamless blend of narrative and exploration—each side quest and encounter feels as detailed and significant as the main storyline. The game’s world is breathtaking, with beautiful landscapes and gritty, immersive environments that draw you in **** any RPG fan, The Witcher 3 is a must-play classic that not only defines the franchise but also sets a high standard for open-world storytelling.",10,2024-11-14,PC,user

Hochbichler,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is an action RPG and the last part of the Witcher trilogy. It was released in 2015. Right off the bat, this game is my favourite video game of all time and trust me, I've played plenty of those. After the success of Witcher 2 and the announcement that Witcher 3 would be an open-world game, I was, for the third time in a row, a bit skeptical about this game. I was not sure how well this unique Witcher would work in the open-world setting. And boy, were my worries unfounded and unnecessary. I would now like to praise some of the best aspects of this masterpiece. First and foremost, the graphics is beautiful and even today, 10 years later, it can still be breathtaking. It is really polished, and the colours work amazingly with the Witcher world. And as a bonus, it was not only beautiful, but also very friendly to those with lower end PCs. The music in this game is superb. So many beautiful original songs and themes that fit the world, the story, the atmosphere so well. The crowning jewel is how the devs were able to work with the Witcher trilogy's simple and yet brilliant main theme and include it in the game in many different variations. If the graphics and music are great, then the story and characters are just superb. The main story is so interesting and diverse that I was not bored for one second of it. It brings the story of Geralt (and yes, the Witcher is Geralt's story, not Ciri's or Yen's, as the netflix bum-diddlers would like you to believe) to an epic, intense and emotional finale. What emotion will the finale awaken in you depends on your choices in the game. But the main story is by no means the only story in The Witcher 3. No, the open-world is filled to the brim with secondary quests, witcher contracts and treasure hunts, all of which are unique and fascinating. And there is just so much of it, that the full game will take you at least 150 hours to finish. That is a massive number, considering that you are not forced (or even able really) to repeat any content. Furthermore, the mammoth length of the game does really make you fall in love with the characters, the story and the world and, at the end, it will truly feel like all these adventures were your own and not Geralt's. The characters were written with amazing respect for the lore and the story, and yet they are so diverse and funny. Consider the stories and fates of: the Bloody Baron, Triss vs. Yen rivalry, the bittersweet story of the last members of the school of the wolf, Radovid, Roach, Dijkstra and countless others. The writers have done a truly masterful job. But it is not just the human or humanoid characters. Geralt is a monster slayer and the monsters play a very important part in this story. And again, the devs have delved deep into the Witcher lore, and they crafted dozens upon dozens of unique, often terrifying, sometimes funny and always fantastic monsters. The next thing I would like to mention is the difficulty and balance. Generally, I believe the game does a great job of it, offering three pretty distinct playstyles and, of course, a great many combinations thereof. As with any RPG, if you play it right, the difficulty drops with time and, by the end, the game offers me very little challenge even on the highest difficulty, but frankly, everything else is so good, that I do not mind in the slightest. The game was released without any major bugs (a praiseworthy achievement considering it's size) and all the minor bugs were soon remedied in a series of 16 free to download patches, which were made available, one every week, after the release. Each of these patches was tied to a small in-game extra content (like a new quest, or alternative appearance for a character). What a fantastic way to patch a game. And on top of that, the devs were so sure of the quality of the game and so fair to the players, that the game was released without any sort of piracy protection whatsoever. What a classy and based move. And all these positive things I have piled upon the game, make up together the most important (and illusive) aspect of them all. The atmosphere. And in Witcher 3, it is simply perfect. All the love for the story and the world, all the dedication and hard work, all the pure unbesmirched excitement is clearly visible, nay almost tangible in the game. Fantastic. As for negatives, I have noticed a few very minor and insignificant things hardly worth mentioning. Maybe the witcher senses item glow should not be visible in the cutscenes, maybe there could be a greater variety of NPC faces and haircuts, but honestly, the game is perfect the way it is. No SJW and no Microtransactions. A full PC playthrough with no fast travel took me 180 hours. This is my favourite game of all times, bar none. And frankly, I do not even dare to hope that I should one day play a game that would rival The Witcher 3. Thank you for this transcending experience. Final Verdict: 99 %",10,2024-11-10,PC,user
KillerTeddyB3ar,"The DLCs are great, I really dislike the base game however. All in all a way too buggy, excessively long, unpolished and mechanically shallow experince for me to recommend. 4/10 base game (which is the biggest part of the game), and an 8/10 for both expansions, so a 6/10~ish for the complete package (base game + both expansions + next gen update)",6,2024-11-06,PC,user
kiozen,"*The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt* is a masterpiece that has redefined the open-world RPG genre, taking players on an epic journey as Geralt of Rivia, a professional monster hunter. The story is rich and compelling, featuring complex characters and a detailed world that responds to player choices. The main plot, centered on the search for Ciri and the looming threat of the Wild Hunt, is complemented by equally well-crafted side quests, each with its own unique and engaging storyline.Gameplay offers a fluid and tactical combat system, blending swordplay and magic into a series of strategic moves that require skill and quick reflexes. Geralt can also prepare for battles with potions, bombs, and oils, adding a layer of depth that rewards careful planning. Exploration is open and highly rewarding, with vast regions filled with secrets, monsters, and villages that react realistically to Geralt’s actions.Visually, *The Witcher 3* is breathtaking, featuring landscapes that range from lush forests to snowy mountains and vibrant cities. The art direction and environmental details are impressive, creating a world that feels genuinely alive. The soundtrack also deserves praise, with evocative melodies that perfectly accompany every moment of exploration and **** essence, *The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt* delivers an immersive, deeply satisfying RPG experience, offering a vast, intricately crafted world that invites players to lose themselves in its narrative and landscapes.",10,2024-11-06,PC,user

E_N_A,"Great game with a great story. All the characters are charismatic and interesting. Additional quests do not make you bored, but on the contrary each story is unique and addictive. The open world is great. Skellige takes a separate place in my heart. And what a great music on that location! From the minuses I can single out the wooden and not very diverse combat system. It is enough to use one or two buttons at most. But I can say that this game should definitely be played by everyone.",10,2024-11-04,PC,user

Phuz,"Glad it was only £5. What's right? Pretty much all of it. Frame rate is a bit **** and combat is average but overall pretty good all round. What's wrong? Also pretty much all of it. It's just not fun. Riding a horse for miles, trickling story. It's so slow. It's a bit like taking an average TV show, chopping it in to 2 minute segments, then dragging each bit out over half an hour. There's just nothing happening. Just getting a very slow story fed to me in piss trickles. Very fetchy. Go here kill that, go there do that. It's really just a whole pile of boring quests. Go this place, kill the guys who are snotty with you, rinse repeat in varying forms. In about 5 hours the story has done practically nothing. World building great. Got the vibe, got the feel but for a world that just isn'tany fun to be in. It's not as bad as Breath of the Wild but it's still bad.",0,2024-09-29,PC,user
Xemnas,"I played through the entire story but without the both DLC expansions (Hearts of Stone & Blood and Wine) and I have to say, I think the game is extremely overrated. The story/lore/worldbuilding/graphics are the only good points, but for that you can also just watch a cutscene compilation on YouTube without playing the game. What I absolutely didn't like was that many decision are not clearly morally according to subsequent narration such as whether one should save the children from the witches or not, although it's actually clear: The evil baron kills himself which was his own decision and for me also pretty unexpected/unrealistic, cause his wife, who groomed children for witches, died even though the curse was lifted, so from my pov it's as redemption for her sins. Or that you have the option to spare **** Junior, which in turn suggests Geralt's bad character. I think Geralt has a rather bad character he often doesn't have much empathy (except for triss, jennefer and ciri), is arrogant, bossy, selfish and nymphomanic, not exactly the best influence or role model in my opinion. The game mechanics are completely underdeveloped and the combat system is incredibly bad, I can't really stand the game.",0,2024-09-26,PC,user

Now, why only 8 points? I'm deducting points for -major bug in the DX12 port, which would not let me talk to a character needed for a major side mission. I had to temporarily switch back to DX11 to do that -absolutely horrible horse mechanics. Horse riding is probably the worst I've experienced in any game, becauseonce its stuck, its stuck.

adabhinav916,"If I were to sum up my experience with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt in one word, it would be ""masterpiece."" From the moment I delved into the richly detailed world of Geralt of Rivia, I was completely captivated. CD Projekt Red has truly outdone themselves with this epic RPG adventure.First and foremost, the world-building in The Witcher 3 is nothing short of phenomenal. Every inch of the sprawling landscape, from the bustling cities to the remote wilderness, feels meticulously crafted and alive with activity. Whether I was wandering the streets of Novigrad or exploring the dense forests of Velen, there was always something new and exciting to discover. But what truly sets The Witcher 3 apart is its storytelling. The narrative is gripping and filled with moral ambiguity, forcing players to make difficult choices that have far-reaching consequences. As Geralt, I found myself faced with decisions that challenged my sense of right and wrong, making each choice feel weighty and meaningful. Of course, none of this would matter without compelling characters to bring the world to life, and The Witcher 3 delivers in spades. From the enigmatic sorceress Yennefer to the roguish bard Dandelion, every character is expertly written and fully realized. And let's not forget about Geralt himself – a stoic yet deeply complex protagonist who I couldn't help but root for. But perhaps the most impressive aspect of The Witcher 3 is its sheer scope and attention to detail. The game is absolutely massive, with dozens of hours of main quest content and even more side quests and activities to keep players entertained. And despite its size, the game never feels bloated or overstuffed – every quest, no matter how small, feels like an essential part of the experience. Of course, no review of The Witcher 3 would be complete without mentioning its stunning visuals and immersive sound design. From the breathtaking vistas to the haunting musical score, every aspect of the game's presentation is top-notch and helps to draw players even further into its world. In conclusion, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is nothing short of a masterpiece. It's a game that sets a new standard for storytelling and world-building in the RPG genre, and one that will undoubtedly be remembered as a classic for years to come. If you haven't had the pleasure of experiencing it for yourself, do yourself a favor and dive in – you won't be disappointed.",10,2024-05-22,PC,user
Fazilrip,wow one of the best gamein historyi like everything and I played it in xbox and play and pc great game,10,2024-05-21,PC,user
Amistiel,"Witcher 3 is one of my all-time favorite games of all time, until BG3 stole the number 1 spot. Still this is a masterpiece as well! The story, the design, the soundtrack, breathtaking!",9,2024-04-29,PC,user
TJohn,"The Witcher 3 is a solid game but not a perfect game in my view. I think the Witcher 3 does a lot of things right. The sound design (including music and voice acting) is some of the best I've ever heard, and the graphics are excellent as well, even years after its release it still compares favorably to many newer titles. The world is also incredible, with tons of cool places to discover, characters to meet, quests to do, and monsters to kill. I feel like the world CD Projekt realized in this game is perhaps one of the best in gaming history. The side quests are top of the line and there were a few standout ones that I felt like were among the best quests I've ever played. I also love that the main quest has several options to deviate depending on your choices, having a few options makes the game feel so much more dynamic. Then there was Gwent... a card game within TW3 which is more than likely the best side game I've ever played. It's integrated so well into the world that you can never touch it if you'd like, yet you can also become a degenerate gambler if you want to challenging people across the land and betting large sums of money. Now despite all this praise, I did have a few gripes with TW3. For one I didn't really like the third person viewpoint or movement controls. Something about them felt kind of clunky, and it felt like I was often getting Geralt stuck in weird places due to the way it worked. I also didn't love the leveling system or its implementation. The designers kinda just filled the world with a mix of different leveled enemies all over, so you're constantly running into enemies that are either too high or too low leveled for you to fight. This can get pretty frustrating because you're constantly having to ignore some cool point of interest because the enemies are too high level. And when you're looking for level appropriate stuff you never quite know where to go since it's all jumbled together. I also don't really like how the game follows Geralt. This is more a personal complaint, but I would've had more fun if I could've created my own character with my own head canon and lore behind him. Following Geralt was exhausting at times because I didn't play the other Witcher games or read the books, so I was constantly trying to figure out what was going on. There were tons of times where some whacky character shows up in the dialogue and Geralt already has this long backstory with them that took place off screen. You as the player are wondering who this person is, what happened between them and Geralt, etc. and they will just skip explaining that and go straight to business with a passing comment or two about the past. There were like half a dozen characters where this happened and it started to get a little annoying, it felt like I was hanging out with a friend group where everyone is in on some inside joke but me, and no one will outright tell you what the joke is, so you're wasting your energy trying to figure it out, then you finally do figure it out only for there to be another inside joke that you aren't in on. This is how the Witcher 3 felt to me. It's still a great game, don't get me wrong, but these few grievances did bother me enough to take it from a 9 or 10 to an 8. Overall though this game is a great RPG game with amazing graphics, sound, quests, and of course Gwent. It's not a perfect game, but I don't think you'll be disappointed by it if you enjoy Fantasy RPGs.",8,2024-04-21,PC,user
SilverOrlov,"Of course I recommend this game. It had its minuses before, and with the big update, in my opinion, they became more numerous, but overall, this game is an indisputable masterpiece of its time, which can be played, or replayed, in 2024 too. First, the pros: Excellent overall graphics, details of objects, houses, characters. The atmosphere, dialogue and music are generally one of the two main advantages of this game, they are beautiful. The second one is the plot and side-quests, there are very few things that really change the ending, but even without branching into 10 endings, this game gives an amazing story, both general and the “monster hunt” one. The game also has a convenient inventory (it didn’t immediately become like that, I remember), easy Gwent (finally the game gave us to lower the thing that not all players needed in a full-fledged adventure, especially for those who didn’t like dead-quests in the diary), auto-leveling (an excellent mechanic for those who level-up faster than the story goes, except perhaps for some scripted enemies) and auto-oil (well, that’s just normal, it didn’t stop me from doing it myself before). I also really, really liked both story DLC's. Made with soul and for the players, both in terms of plot and in terms of exploring a new large location in the second one. As for the disadvantages, I would include torn straight bushes (this is just a failure, it constantly infuriated me to watch these fields of sticks and rectangles instead of grass and bushes), things glow after they are taken with a witcher's look, bugs with pins not disappearing on the map when you take them . Lighting candles (a separate cauldron in hell for the one who came up with this. The whole game you constantly light these candles that no one needs), the skill tree often shows garbage or a crooked, stupid description that does not correspond to reality. Often the character simply wouldn’t dive until you reloaded, and I really don’t like his jerky turns when you press movement in any direction (it was just annoying on very small ledges and roofs). Perhaps it was just with me, but all the boats on Skellige floated backward first if you pressed forward, and then forward as it should. For many, the character Leto did not appear in the designated place and because of this a very interesting quest was lost (As I read on the Internet, this is due to the fact that the saves from the 2nd part are somehow transferred incorrectly, you need to carefully do this manually). Well, and the icing on the cake: After a month of slow play, enjoying exploring the World... my game-save file disappeared. It's just that simple. I tried for almost a day to return it, but all in vain. Then I simply replayed it from the beginning, but this left a strong negative feeling in the moment. At that time, I didn’t use cloud saving because I had a negative experience in a couple of other games when it was buggy and rolled the game back to what it was before. Well... as I said, there were some disadvantages, but in general all its advantages greatly outweigh in favor of this game. So, nevertheless, I consider it as a must-have.",9,2024-04-06,PC,user

hknmrt61,"After playing for about two hours, I could tell that this game was going to become my all-time favorite. I wasn't really into this genre before, but The Witcher's storytelling is so captivating that it turned me into a fan. I believe the game's strongest aspect is its storytelling, and back when it was released, there was nothing quite like it. It feels like you're immersed in a movie, where you have control over how things unfold, but not in a godlike way—more like real life. The key to this experience is probably Geralt, since he isn't strictly good or evil, allowing you to navigate the game in a morally gray area. Admittedly, the combat did get a bit repetitive over time, but that's just something we have to accept. Since the game got old.",10,2024-01-25,PC,user

MasajaMasta,"I will tell you something. I thought this game was overrated for almost the first 100 hours (something like 1/3 of the game for me, I play slow) that I put into it... But then... I understood. I kept measuring this game and everything in it by comparing it to other titles. Then I somewhat stopped... Because I was simply getting too much of something else that was just so unbelievably high for, like, all the time. Something uncommon. And I finally understood everything. The most consistent-keep-suprising-deep-well-thought-world-and-characters than in any other video game maybe ever... Because I was playing for soo long... And the game, characters, stories... Everything kept getting better. And how all of this can also be non-linear and connected to each other in such a big game like this is... Just beyond me... Like, to this point, I didn't even think something like this on this level is even possible. Quests were almost all so interesting and tasteful and non-repeating and real like nowhere else. Like, each one, even the smallest, had a much better story than main stories in almost every game... ****, even better than movies... ( and definitely better than anything in the Netflix series but that's beside the point:) ) Like... I am not sure how to describe it... The writers aren't trying to give characters gimmicks so you could easily quickly say: ""I know, so this is THAT type of character""... It's like they don't try... they just act and speak like real people, not video game characters. Like they are from real flesh and blood. It's like this world IS real. It's like you feel them (and not in a cheap way when the writers clearly tell you how you should see their characters and you are a bad person if you aren't just assuming and believing and acknowledging what the writers with their biases want because it's all just so surface-level and stupid:) ). Like, you really feel the characters as people in this game. You understand them. The world and them are just so... Really interesting:) And from that point on... You completely understand why this is the kind of game that destroys other games for you. Makes you smart enough to see what is possible and how other companies really treat you like dumb gamers and just look down on you (especially when they don't give you stories and characters but just safe propaganda with things trying to pretend it's a story and keep using sex, race or sexual preference as shields so they can call you a bad person if you criticize something). Damn... I could just talk and talk about this game. I get why people dislike it. They just don't get it and focus on criticizing the fighting system ( play on the hardest difficulty, it's a must, I am so glad I listened to someone before and chose it ). People dislike it fast because they assume a completely wrong attitude towards it. And, unfortunately, that's pretty normal for them because they really don't have anything else so adult in gaming to compare it to. So they aren't quick to see why... This is THE GAME. I know because it also happened to me:)",10,2023-10-24,PC,user

OgnistyKamilek,"A classic nowadays and definitely a must-play. The Witcher 3 is an example for games that also try to be big but fail in terms of activity. The plot was good and the side stories were even better. The side missions were always top-notch in terms of the plot, they were interesting, and I don't know if there was a mission that made me want to finish it as quickly as possible. I always enjoyed these tasks because they were really good. Witcher orders are also missions that are worth our attention. I consider them very interesting, especially since the rewards are always on the same level. Throughout the entire game, I always had one reservation and that was the character development. I felt a bit stuck when it came to Geralt's abilities. On the one hand, I felt that how could such a badass not be even more badass? On the other hand, I explained it to myself that, in terms of immersion, Geralt already has a lot of knowledge from the beginning. Either way, I recommend the game.",9,2023-09-18,PC,user

Alias--,This game is terribly overrated. Uninspired and empty open world with exploration that consists of riding to question marks on the map. Gameplay is janky and combat is a chore.

You go into CD Projekt's restaurant, sit down in a cozy place in the corner, and then the chefs that have worked so hard for you to enjoy your time there unveil the vast amount of things they've prepared. Everything in this game clicks. From the story, the world around you, the music and the beautiful graphics to the combat itself. Another positive about this game is that you can get it for as low as 10 bucks sometimes, and It is truly one of the best if not the best experiences you can live through, If you only like this kind of games.

NZXD,"Story: The main quest of rescuing Ciri could be seen as a missed opportunity for an open world game. Wow, Geralt, look at this expansive and breathtaking map... BUT HURRY, THEY ARE ABOUT TO KILL HER! But take it easy... why not take a break and play some cards? Why not visit the tavern, share stories, and enjoy the world around you? - BUT HURRY, THEY ARE ABOUT TO KILL HER! Protagonist: Geralt is portrayed as an exceptionally skilled and cool character. Geralt is cool... I wonder if maybe a bit too much. It's common in most role-playing or open world games to start as a nobody and gradually become someone, building and defining your character along the way. This can be a highly satisfying experience. When you envision how you will design and develop your character, and finally witness their full growth, it feels amazing. It reflects all the hours and effort you've invested in the game. However, in The Witcher 3, you begin as Geralt at level 1 with 5 spells and 2 swords, and after countless hours, you end up as Geralt at level 35 with 5 spells and 2 swords. The only difference is that, mysteriously, the latter feels ineffective and unable to face any challenges, despite being Geralt of Rivia, the legendary witcher with years of experience. For instance, I can easily defeat a griffin without any issues, but then I enter an area where I supposedly shouldn't be, and a dwarf bandit kills me. At a certain point, you question whether the leveling system was necessary in this game, if it was included simply because other games have it, and if it truly aligns with what a witcher is supposed to do. If perhaps they should have focused on depth in other aspects of the game instead. Inventory and Rewards: I'll be clear: On which planet, in which corner of the known universe, is the inventory system in this game considered acceptable? How many crafting materials does Geralt carry? I often find myself not knowing what half of the items I take are for. Does the game genuinely expect me to have the energy to read and learn the purpose of each item? Instead of being a game with 5 significant options, it presents us 100, and in the end, I find myself performing the same actions in every battle. As for the open world... Rather than exploring by gazing at the horizon, I'm constantly guided by a minimap with markers indicating where to go.",6,2023-07-11,PC,user

gamakazil,"A Timeless Masterpiece - 10/10 There are very few games that have the ability to capture a player's heart and soul quite like Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt. As a yearly ritual, I find myself compelled to return to this enchanting world, and with each playthrough, my admiration for this work of art only grows. The most captivating aspect of Witcher 3 is undoubtedly its story. The narrative is rich and engaging, weaving a complex tapestry of characters and plotlines that keep you enthralled throughout the game. The attention to detail in every quest is simply astonishing, and the depth of emotion conveyed by each character is unmatched. The game effortlessly delves into themes of love, loss, and redemption, resulting in a story that resonates deeply with its players. However, a great story alone does not make a game outstanding. Witcher 3's gameplay is meticulously crafted to complement the narrative, offering an experience that is tailor-made for THE Witcher. Every aspect of the gameplay loop and character development is designed to immerse you in the world that the developers have so painstakingly created, making it impossible not to become fully invested in Geralt's journey. The combat, exploration, and RPG elements are all seamlessly integrated, allowing players to experience the game in a way that feels entirely authentic. Each element of the gameplay, from the potion brewing and monster hunting to the choices you make in dialogues, is carefully aligned with the lore and the story that the game is trying to tell. This level of commitment to immersion is what sets Witcher 3 apart from other games in the genre. From the hauntingly beautiful opening scene in White Orchard to the poignant moments shared with Yennefer in Corvo Bianco, Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt is a game that I will continue to play and cherish year after year. It is a true testament to the power of storytelling in gaming and a shining example of what can be achieved when developers pour their heart and soul into a project. If you have not yet experienced this masterpiece, I cannot recommend it highly enough.",10,2023-04-25,PC,user

Didn’t know anything about this game until one lf my friends told me to play it. First time i played it, i uninstalled the game after playing 2 hours because i didn’t find it enjoyable at first. My friend told me to keep playing so i installed the game and told myself to give it atleast a day of playing. Today i finished the whole game, every side quest, ever contracts or literally just everything. Can’t wait for Witcher 4. 100/10 game",10,2023-04-18,PC,user

Liviaaa,"What a masterpiece ****! It's like a gourmet meal for the senses, satisfying and delectable in every way. From the captivating storyline to the breathtaking graphics, this game is a true feast for gamers. The story is rich, complex, and engrossing, like a good book you just can't put down. The characters are so well-developed that you feel like you're living in their world, experiencing their joys and sorrows. And the best part? The choices you make actually matter, leading to different outcomes and endings. But it's not just the story that's impressive. The world of The Witcher 3 is vast and beautiful, with stunning landscapes and intricate details. Every corner of the map is filled with secrets, quests, and monsters to slay. And speaking of monsters, the game's creature designs are simply amazing. Combat is a perfect balance of strategy and skill, with various weapons and abilities to master. You'll need to think on your feet and adapt to each battle, making it all the more satisfying when you emerge victorious. The game is full of memorable moments that will make you laugh, cry, and everything in between.",10,2023-04-09,PC,user

gamerz4life,"The Witcher 3 was barely out before being hyped as the absolute pinnacle of RPG-gaming, a must play for everyone & you needn’t bother playing Witcher 1 or 2 before playing 3. Naturally it gets picked as 2015’s GOTY. Who knew it was possible to win more than 800 awards for a video game? Those who say these things clearly haven’t played many video games, not to mention RPGs, let alone Witcher 1&2, which are both far better than Witcher 3 Its biggest sin is being an open-world game. They did this to compete with games like Dragon Age: Inquisition (2014’s GOTY) & Elder Scrolls: Skyrim (2011’s GOTY). Too much time was spent on building this massive world that not much thought was given on how they would fill it. It was empty & incredibly tedious to trek across the map between missions. You’ve done wrong when the player chooses to fast travel everywhere rather than go on foot. You’re also forced to find a sign post in order to fast travel, you can’t just do it from the map. An open world usually means cutting meaningful quests & characters, which Witcher 3 did in spades; the biggest being no Scoia’tael/Iorveth. In addition, the AI chatter was enough to make me go mad; the same lines repeated over & over w/ the same voices. I can say them in my sleep. The cutscenes were supposed to be Dandelion but for some reason aren’t done by his voice actor, the guy doesn’t even sound close. The combat is atrocious, when you feel that the better option is to hack, slash & roll like a ballerina rather than use tactics because the enemies aren’t known for their brains. The use of potions/oils was practically nonexistent until halfway through because you don’t get the crafting diagrams & by then you’ve learned to cope w/o so you don’t even remember that you can now use them. Meditation is not to make potions but to reload your stock using alcohol in your inventory. Tutorials would have been immensely helpful rather than a block of text you’ll never remember. Negotiation is senseless, “A bit high… We’re almost there.” The upgrade system is a complete joke. What’s the point in investing in skills when you can only use a few? Getting to level 30 you can use 12 skills and yet I had many more! You literally need to use a slot in order to have food/drink heal you over time! What? That was just a given in the other games. The story absolutely requires you to have not only played the first 2 games but that you’ve read the books as well. I can’t imagine what anyone could have gotten out of this game otherwise. But even though I had the knowledge of the whole story, I felt this game’s story was super weak. They were trying to tell too much & pull in the worst parts of Sapkowski’s books. The first 2 games felt like CDPR was adding to the story of The Witcher and telling their own tale, they weren’t just making the books a game, rather they continued Geralt’s tale a few years after the books. But with this game, it felt the complete opposite. They were now pulling everything they could from the last 2 books (which were awful) & pulling phrases & jokes from every form of entertainment in the real world. It seriously hurt the story. The idea of Ciri traveling between worlds, including our own is just stupid, they could have rewritten something so much better. Instead what was once a dark fantasy is now science fiction. It was very obvious that they had a completely different writer this time around. Despite calling itself an RPG, there were no significant choices in this game. Sure there were 3 different endings for Ciri’s fate but as to how those endings were decided, it was a couple small things in conversations rather than actual decisions. It really makes you feel good when you read the wiki and see ‘You can choose whatever you want here, it makes no difference to the story.’ When a choice cutscene would randomly pop up, it felt more like a whoops we forgot to give this meaning so here’s a choice that **** either way. The game is at 4.02 & still buggy. The choice scenes are at a far lower volume than the rest of the game, it’s a miracle if you can hear them w/o subsequently blowing your eardrums out when it switches back to the actual game. There is so much clipping, things disappearing from NPC’s hands or hovering in front of them, animals including Roach would appear in the middle of a conversation with an NPC, etc. What exactly did they fix? Now how can we talk about Witcher 3 w/o mentioning the card game Gwent? What a truly horrendous, time-wasting addition. It was clearly there to pad out the game time. You’re forced into your first game to ‘learn’ the directions & I came away no wiser as how to play. All Gwent did was make me miss dice poker. In the main game alone, I completed 141 quests in 104.8 hours. I would only recommend for the serious Witcher fan b/c all I can say is thank the Eternal Fire I’m done, I’m headed back to Witcher 1&2",5,2023-04-07,PC,user

Однако сплошные положительные отзывы, как от игроков, так и от критиков заставили меня пересмотреть свои интересы и все же окунутся в мир Ведьмака. Я еще никогда так не ошибался.. С чистой совестью можно назвать Ведьмака Лучшей игрой не только от CD Projekt RED, но и вообще лучшей игрой десятилетия! Игра без изъянов, которая может выйти (а может и не выйти) раз в поколение. Настолько детальный и кропотливый созданный мир. Каждая деревушка, каждый город, каждая тропинка, каждая речка и каждая чаща ни на секунду не дает вам ощущения, того что вы сидите за монитором, а не скачете на Плотве мимо этих красот. А саундтрек усиливает эти и без того острые ощущения, идеально гармонируя с происходящим на экране. Каждый , даже второстепенный квест, сделан с любовь и в ручную.

I keep on finding myself getting hit from behind when I'm doing a combo on an enemy, the only good thing I can say about the combat is... I don't know.... Second of all it crashes a lot: I don't know why but yeah, I have one hell of a beefy computer. It can run a lot of games on Max graphics. I mean it's the same people that made that glitchy mess.

While neither three stand out as spectacular, I thought they all worked well together. The sidequests in this game are also super strong.

Mindurbidniss,"Awesome game. Game of the decade? Hell no, it's full of euro-jank and character movement and animations are nowhere near the level of Red Dead Redemption, but there's a level of agency to be found in this game that existed nowhere else at the time. Combat is incredibly ""of the time"" consisting of hit, roll, and dodge mechanics reminiscent of Assassin's Creed. This system leaves so much to be desired considering the implementation of potions and concoctions that were barely utilized, even on the Blood and Broken Bones difficulty. The graphics are also nothing to sneeze at. Released in 2015, this game still gives more graphically intense titles a run for their money. Add that to an open world, brilliant quest design, and characters with multiple levels of depth to them and you've gotten yourself a title that punches way above what was expected of it, judging by the previous. Side quests also play a large role in The Witcher 3, which is great because side quests are where this game shines. Due to multiple choices which lead to multiple outcomes, each playthrough of The Witcher 3 is different. Some side quests even surpass those that are essential to the main story with their intricacies and decisions driven pathways. Ultimately The Witcher 3 is a game to own, or at least a game to experience. The player driven choice aspect is enough to entice the curiosity of many a gamer. Is it as good as most publications would leave you to believe? No, not at all. But it is a game worth getting lost in. A game you'll play and lose track of time with. Even a title you'll find yourself returning to year after year because of the quality that lies underneath it's many flaws.",7,2023-01-05,PC,user

Ratelate7,"Had potential, but is let down by a few things. The deal-breaker for me was the implementation of some less than savoury relationships time and time again, which were so shameless and ham-fisted by the writers that I couldn't reasonably approve of. Questlines are generally samey and boring, consisting of staring at a glowing line on the ground or walking into a sequence of designated combat areas until the quest resolves itself. Most locations also follow a ""formula"", which means you're rarely going to discover a new location and find something out of the ordinary, rather than just one of the eight or so categories that new locations tend to fall under (like a monster nest or bandit camp). The characters are developed and intricate, seeing as how they've had a series of novels and games to be constructed, but there's always one or two scenes with them that sort of puts me off them as a whole. The graphics are very good for the year it was released, and it's a very polished game mechanically and thematically. Unfortunately, the ""minor things"" and ""nitpicks"" eventually build up to become very noticeable, and this means that the experience eventually becomes too cynical for me to enjoy it. The music is okay, but nothing special, with some of the tracks widely regarded as amazing seeming too emotional and movie-like for my tastes.",4,2022-12-21,PC,user

fray_bentos,"I was really excited to play this game after enjoying other open-world action-RPG games such as Zelda:BotW and OoT, AC:Origins/Odyssey, God of War (2018), Horizon: Zero Dawn, Batman Arkham games and GTA:V. I waited for the ""next-gen version"" to release. The game looks gorgeous, and some of the story and character development seems very good (though a bit long-winded for me). However, I play games to play them, not to watch them. My main bugbears are: The combat and character movement/interaction with the world is clunky, buggy, and frustrating. The inventory system is overly complicated. There is an overwhelming amount of stuff to do. Sections of the game are gated off by levels (as enemies become too tough to tackle). Ultimately, much to my surprise, I find the game dull and boring, and I am not finding it fun at all. After reading around it seems that many people have the same experience with the same issues flagged. Many of the game mechanics are very similar to in the AC games, but I often felt that they were done better in the AC games, especially the combat, inventory/loot system, and hunting for clues. Then, I hit a bug where I hit a black screen fast travelling between sign posts; a bug that apparently dates back to 2015... I uninstalled and moved on to other games in my backlog. In the future, I will look for action RPGs where the action and gameplay takes a more central role. I found Red Dead Redemption dull for similar reasons. Not for me.",3,2022-12-20,PC,user

Drakelio,"They just chose the worst way possible to deliver this ""free upgrade"". 1) They put it over (crushing) the original game code, (they could have added it as a separated game, like with the Bioshock games, or The Elders Scroll). 2) They made it mandatory. If you don't want it or if your PC was just-enough to play the original game, with these update you are screwed, as it will drain more resources and you have no choice about it. 3) They will break all the mods that you have installed, and again you can't just choose to turn the ""free upgrade"" off. 4) They took the change to also force-feed you their ""RedLauncher"", yet another annoying software that wasn't on the original game when I bought it. 5) They broke steam overlay. When I try to open it inside the game it's like it tries to do so (because it produces some kind of ""obscuring"" over the game), but fails to open it. This is more like a ""Free upgrade either you like it or not, just gulp it down (or throw the game you bought) because we say so"". This review is not about the update itself, but about screwing your customer by forcing him to do what you want. This is not a good practice and should always be criticized.",0,2022-12-13,PC,user

Chalkbrood,"How does a studio put so much money and effort into something and have it come out so wrong? The story and the writing is mostly just fine (generic high fantasy with stupidly limited options during sidequests) People drool and clap for this garbage like it's somehow revolutionary but it came out in 2017 and it fails to do things that games in 2002 were capable of. It's impossible to know where to start breaking down how awful the gameplay is so I'll just write a list of bullet points: -your horse's pathing is awful even when it's supposed to be automatic -the horse has a stamina gauge and I really cannot fathom why, it only comes up during a couple racing sidequests and those are so easy that it's pointless, so this mechanic just gets in the way of regular gameplay simply because there is a badly designed sidequest that it's relevant to -draw distance is miserable in some areas -npc dialogue is moronic and irrelevant, you will be fighting side by side with people and saving their lives for some pointlessly dull quest and they will shout things like ""sorcery! he's a witch"" -every bad thing that already exists about open world games is basically still present, most quests are shallow and bland, everybody waits for an eternity for you to do things cause you're the only person who can, etc etc etc -the basis of the game is that you are a witcher, a person who hunts monsters, and monster hunting contracts are miserably repetitive and uninteresting -there's an alchemy system that begs for your inventory to be cluttered, you will never ever remember what ingredients you need cause it's always just some flower or some blood or teeth or whatever stupid thing and it won't be relevant for 5 hours and then you'll need one if you want to craft some semi useful item, this wouldn't be so bad but you have a weight limit and inventory management is terrible in this -everything is weirdly dark, even during daytime, I found this unplayable without mods -the main character comes across like an idiot cause some moron dev decided that he should constantly be shouting out combat taunts -seriously the inventory management is awful, when you're looking at different weapons and armor it doesn't even show you a full stat comparison of what you're looking at and what you're wearing -a lot of sidequests have completely unsatisfying conclusions and it feels like it's because there are questions you're just not allowed to ask, like there's some forced stupidity so that no matter what there's something bad that happens. Save the orphans? a village is destroyed. Save the village? orphans are eaten. can you talk to the spirit that's gonna eat orphans and stop it? no. can you talk to the spirit about why it would destroy the village or ask it its motivations? no -incredibly convoluted, here is a snippet of what I did early game: I'm sent by a king to get his daughter. someone who has information about that daughter won't give it to me until I help him find his daughter and wife. I have to go ask two other people for help. one of them makes me find his goat before he helps me. then the guy with the information that I need reveals that I have to help him save the soul of his wife's miscarriage. then him and the guy with the goat ask me to go to a swamp. then I meet a little boy who knows another little boy who knows about some witches who want me to kill a creature that lives under a tree in another city. by the end of that paragraph did you remember what I originally set out to do? -weapon degradation, not necessarily a bad mechanic but it doesn't even matter in this cause there are so many weapons that are so similar that you just keep picking up so why is weapon degradation in the game? because the devs add terrible things without thinking -you gain abilities but you're capped at how many you're allowed to equip, this is like being in a sandbox and someone coming by and saying ""no no, you can't use the shovel and the bucket at the same time"", this is a terrible mechanic -seriously dialogue is terrible sometimes, ""you have to find dudu to find dandelion to find ciri"" ""I'm going to go talk to **** jr."" were two back to back pieces of dialogue, it's like the characters weren't even interacting with each other -terrible ""detective"" mechanic during monster hunts wherein you hold a button that lights up what you're supposed to do so that you don't have to use your brain. it's mind numbingly dull it's too bad, I was quite engaged and I wanted to see where the story was going but I just couldn't stomach how godawful this game was at every turn",4,2022-12-11,PC,user

Glemdal,"Best game I have every played. The characters, story and atmosphere are all amazing. Almost everything in this game feels like it was made by developers who actually cared about the game. The sidequests, especially are some of the best in modern video game history. The world is also excellent, it can sometimes even be a bit overwhelming with so many things to do. However if you just give the game the time it requires, I'm sure you will be satisfied. I'm saying this because because on my third playthrough I did literally everything in the game and that took 140!! hours. Just the mainstory takes between 50-60 hours, which in my opinion is amazing because I obviously enjoyed it so much. Everything can't be perfect though, that game will never exist. My 2 biggest criticism for the game is that the combat can sometimes feel lackluster, it doesn't get in the way for me and I mostly enjoy it but it's clear that it isn't at the same level as the writing or the atmosphere. The 2nd thing is that the final act of the main story can feel a bit rushed, I know that sounds silly after I just said that the main story takes between 50-60 hours to complete, but at least in my opinion I felt that the story moved a bit to quickly in the final act and it would have been cool to explore some more things in that act without mentioning any spoilers. To conclude, this is the best game I have ever played. I am no game-critic´, this is just an honest opinion, coming from a 21 year old guy from Sweden. No game has ever had the impact the Witcher 3 has had on me. After I finished this game I obviously played it again because you have to, but besides that I also played through both Witcher 1 and Witcher 2, and read the books. I can wholeheartedly recommend all of that, it was an amazing experience from start to finish. Thank you CD Project for letting me experience your masterpiece.",10,2022-11-25,PC,user

Прекрасный открытый мир с разными локациями. В каждой локации своя музыка, своя атмосфера, у тебя действительно возникает чувство того, что ты уехал в совсем другое место. Потрясающе прописаны все герои. Очень крутая нелинейность, ты в практически каждом квесте можешь повлиять на что-то своим выбором, иногда даже не осознавая этого. Классный саундтрек.

First launched The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt back in 2016, but then I didn't understand why I can't create my hero like in The Elder Scrolls games, or why my hero has 2 swords and 5 kinds of magic, how to choose another class. I was used to classic RPG games and I was repulsed by the game for not being able to give me a different hero. A year passed and I decided to give the game a second chance as friends were praising the game and there were very positive reviews everywhere. Bottom line - 75 hours flew by unnoticed, the game is so good that I was thinking how quickly I could fall asleep so I could start playing it again tomorrow.

Objectively speaking, the story and narrative is just surreal, the enviormental absortion is incredible, the characters are so fun, the gameplay itself is fun .... Now subjectively speaking... i never, in my life, read a book before Withcer 3, i hated it, every book assigned to me in school i would just find a way to ""review"" it in class without reading it, outside of class there was no situation i wanted to actually read, after Witcher3, i started reading the books.... the world and characters were soo good i wanted more, for me this is a very big deal. DO you know that feeling, when you go away and travel or have to move to other cities for school, college or even work, something temporary? But then you return home and feel that inner peace, knowing you are where you belong and actually wanna be? Thats how i feel about this game, i know it might sound stupid, but everytime i started a new gameplay or just log in the world, i just have that feeling, i know this streets these people... it's just...

in_sola_lupus,"The first thing you will understand and see in the game when you launch it is, of course, the graphics, it is at the highest level here. I had a lot of trouble with the high settings, but I could clearly see the pores on Geralt's skin, their rustling is visible on the wooden floor or fence, that they are not polished, but unfortunately I could not play on such settings. Then, when you start the game, you will plunge headlong into the plot, into witchy abilities, into magic, into the wars of kings and even into the problems of ordinary people. You take all the tasks from the bulletin board or they appear during your wanderings from people in trouble, but sometimes it turns out to be a trap and bandits can attack you. Tasks are divided into different types, these are: basic, additional, witcher orders, treasure hunting. The main ones are plot tasks, additional ones are tasks from the bulletin board or from people in trouble, witcher orders are tasks related to monsters, monsters, ghosts, that is, with the other world. Treasure hunt is a task for the witcher's equipment. Judging by the above, you probably realized that the world of the Witcher 3 is very open. The map is huge that even sometimes on horseback you can run for a very long time. Along the way, you may encounter abandoned villages, monsters, bandits, deserters of war, aggressive animals. The map also shows places that are unknown and there may be treasures or something worse like a monster lair, or chests tied to barrels thrown into the sea so that they do not go to the bottom, which also have a lot of useful things. There is an opportunity to move by boat on the water surface. You will also put equipment on Geralt's horse Roach, which give different effects like resistance to panic when monsters are nearby, the capacity of your bags and the speed of the Roach. Also in the game there is a mini-game called gwint - this is a card game on the board, but not an ordinary card game, each card has different strength, different abilities, where you will play either for money or for rare cards with which your additional tasks will be associated. The game has a crafting system, but without recipes and ingredients you can't collect anything worthwhile. Starting with alchemy, where you can create different drinks that give you positive effects, like accelerated regeneration, cat vision, creating bombs and oils against monsters, people and ghosts, ending with forge craft, where you can create weapons and armor for yourself. But only now you can create armor and weapons thanks to the blacksmiths that you will find in villages or cities. Blacksmiths also vary in specialization (blacksmith in weapons, blacksmith in armor) and skill level. The higher the master's level, the more high-level items he can create from your found recipes. The witcher also has a book called ""Bestiary"" in which all the monsters are listed and how to fight against them, but basically information about one of them is entered there when you kill the monster, and not before the battle with it begins, so it will be hard for you with some monsters and you will have to climb into Google.",10,2022-10-17,PC,user

Czechinator,"I wish all open world RPGs were of similar quality to this one. Immersive world, dialogue. It's rare that one feels sorry for a game village or NPC. Game decisions really change the story and have weight. ( Not like most modern RPGs where the choices are cosmetic). Combat is fun. Talents are ok. Characters that really connect with the player. Great music and ambient sounds. A sunset that takes your breath away. A beautiful world that I enjoyed wandering through. The only thing that annoyed me was the large number of question marks in the sea , which were mere boxes . And as a 100% completionist I had to collect them :D Thanks to this game I read all the books and short stories.",10,2022-08-16,PC,user

KapralDominik,"Совершенство экшн RPG во всей красе. Графическое пиршество, широкое изобилие квестов по интересу и прописанной истории соперничающие с основным сюжетом некоторых новых проектов, сеты, билды, разнообразие зелий и рун, чудовища (при чем не всегда в обличии монстров, если вы понимаете о чем я), а также море багов оставшихся грузом с релиза (куда же без них). Еще отдельного упоминания заслуживают дополнения, они в кой-то веке стоят каждой копейки (сейчас и то продаются за бесценок). Как одна из лучших игр эвер, Ведьмак заслуживает того что бы в него играть и исследовать каждый кусочек этого удивительного мира, от гор Каэр Морхена до бескрайних тайников на морских просторах Скеллиге.

LoadOfRubbish,"Прошёл эту игру 3 раза, но всё равно не смог всё исследовать. Масштабный открытый мир, в котором вроде бы много качественного и интересного контента, но всё же он кажется пустоватым. Большую часть занимают леса, равнины, и мелкие деревушки, в которых редко встречается по настоящему качественный контент. Боевая система скучна и однообразна. Спам ЛКМ, или просто нужно зажать ту же кнопку при определённом билде, на ней зацикливать внимание нету смысла. Эта игра цепляет совсем другим, а именно кинематографичностю. Камера всегда расположена отлично, высокого уровня анимации, диалоги, озвучка персонажей, вот на что в этой игре стоит обращать внимание. Каждый персонаж имеет за собой какую-то историю, поэтому рекомендую сначала прочитать книги, а только после начинать прохождение, так как будет очень много моментов в которых можно просто не понять суть. Сюжет в этой игре это просто нечто, люди которые работали над сюжетом просто гении. Была проделана настолько огромная работа, что в некоторых сайд квестах сюжет лучше чем, основной сюжет некоторых ААА проектов. Геймплей. Многие называют эту игру ""Лучшая РПГ за всю историю"", но стоит понимать, что эта игра вообще в принципе не РПГ, только разве что в моментах когда отыгрываешь ведьмака, но это происходит не часто. Я бы назвал этот жанр ""слэшер с элементами РПГ"". Боевая система в этой игре просто дно, типичный слэшер, сначала уворачиваешься, или парируешь атаки противника, бьёшь, потом опять уворачиваешься -> бьёшь, и так пока не убьёшь противника, наглядный пример это битвы с големом на низких уровнях. Выбор в этой игре есть и он влияет на события, но он довольно странный в некоторых моментах. Выбор может повлиять как на моменты не относящийся до основного сюжета, как например выбор между Трисс и Йеннифер, так и на концовку влияют некоторые выборы . В этой игре, как и в многих подобных есть настольные игры. Здесь это ККИ ""Гвинт"". Очень интересная мини-игра, которая позже переросла в самостоятельную ККИ по мотивам вселенной ведьмака. Багов в этой игре очень много, начиная просто с визуальных, заканчивая багами влияющие на геймплей. Например у меня был такой баг, что персонаж просто переставал бить, не знаю был ли у кого-то другого такой баг, но у меня он случался не часто, но всё же неприятно, чтобы решить проблему нужно было выйти из режима боя, или перезагрузить сохранение. В целом, эта игра имеет много проблем, на которые разработчики просто забили, но все эти минуса нивелирует шедевральная кинемотографичность. Все персонажи чувствуются живыми, за них переживаешь. Сценаристы просто гении, многие моменты продуманы до мельчайших деталей, в пример можно привести момент с туалетом возле замка Вроницы. В итоге моя оценка 8/10.",8,2022-06-17,PC,user

The games are based on The Witcher series of fantasy novels written by Andrzej Sapkowski. The game takes place in a fictional fantasy world based on Slavic mythology. Players control Geralt of Rivia, a monster slayer for hire known as a Witcher, and search for his adopted daughter, who is on the run from the otherworldly Wild Hunt. Players battle the game's many dangers with weapons and magic, interact with non-player characters, and complete quests to acquire experience points and gold, which are used to increase Geralt's abilities and purchase equipment.

I didn't even had high expectations for the game, because I know how overdramatic and overhyped gamers get and how they like to throw around 10/10. It is at best a slightly above average game and that's it, just like cyberpunk (after like 1.5 years of beta testing).

DovakinSkyrim,"Это лучшая игра, по моему мнению, за всю историю игровой индустрии. Здесь всё идеально: сюжет, геймплей, графика, музыкальное сопровождение, персонажи, открытый мир. Главного героя сделали как канонично почти бесчувственным, так и интересным, живым и человечным. Это невероятно. Сюжет настолько драматичный, что ты понимаешь чувства героев, и самое главное - понимаешь Геральта из Ривии - главного протагониста всей великой и воистину легендарной саги. CD Project Red умудрились почти точно перенести книжный роман пана Анджея Сапковского в серию игр. Итог: игра шедевральна и неповторима настолько, насколько шедевральна и неповторима любовь. Ведь действительно - игра дарит незабываемую эйфорию, что ассоциируется с первой любовью - самой сильной.",10,2022-03-10,PC,user

Kostas_Spirou,"An amazing journey of a monster hunter in every way possible. The main story is very well made with a great cast of characters, and the writing is fantastic, everything in the game has depth to it. The amount of content is absolutely ridiculous, at first you might get overwhelmed by all the activities the game throws at you, but exploring the map and doing side quests is definitely worth it, this game has perhaps the best side quests I've ever experienced, and the quest design is phenomenal. The dialogue options are groundbreaking, almost every quest has different outcomes and interactions, it's insane. Your actions have consequences and if you're not careful, you can miss entire questlines that can alter your experience. It's an all-around solid game, it does almost everything very well, except from the gameplay which is a little bit clunky so you'll have to get used to it, and some animations look weird. The biggest problem I have with the game personally is the amount of filler and padding in the first half of the story, it takes way too long for it to pick up, but the last few hours are just incredible. Also the boss fights are disappointingly simple and easy, no challenge whatsoever. Top Tier Open World in my opinion, it's very enjoyable from start to finish, there are so many things to do in this game. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt achieved the impossible, it's unbelievable how a small Polish studio managed to create this monster of a videogame.

Fvnfvnfvn,"One of the most engaging and interesting RPG's I've ever played, and I didn't even get to make a custom character. The Witcher 3 stands proudly above all other RPGs and rightfully so. Its brooding dark setting are beset by its colorful cast of characters and wonderful writing which can range from fairly generic at times to downright tear jerking. Gameplay - From a gameplay perspective The Witcher 3 uses a very well fleshed out system of combat, magic, and dialogue to let the player cultivate their own unique experience within Geralt's story. The combat ranges from button mashy when fighting crowds, to creative and visceral when facing boss and monster with out ever feeling grindy or unsatisfying. Geralt controls well and depending on your temperament can be quite suave and even hilarious at times. There are plethora of system available in the game as well which help to supplement the overall experience. Except Gwent... I hate Gwent. Crafting and forging not only give you stronger equipment but potions and charms which can give you advantages against the men and monsters of this world. Story - The story ranges from basic rpg go here do x formula to down right engage story lines for even some of the small quests. I often found myself compelled to complete quest with stale gameplay just to see the story outcome they would have, and I'm happy to say most are worth doing! While the main story line grows stale from time to time side quests do a great job of keeping you engaged with the game enough that it never feels like a slough or choir to complete. Although it is probably best to take your time with this one, and make sure to buy the GOTY edition for the DLCs. Probably the most fun I've had with an RPG since Mass Effect and Fallout New Vegas, The Witcher 3 strikes a cord deep with anyone looking to lose themselves and many hour of their time in it wonderous and brutal world!

Odal,"The Witcher 3 is a legendary game in the genre of RPG:s. One of the best RPG:s ever made. While it's quite linear, I think most good RPG:s tend to be. Because that's the way you build a memorable story. What makes the game so good is it's narrative driven gameplay, combined with amazing aesthetics, music, characters and setting of the game. You really feel like you are in a European Slavic- folktale. The combat is fun, the graphics (for it's time) looked amazing and every side quest is an adventure. It's not made for children - in that it doesn't shun away from grittyness, nude, and adult topics and that makes the game feel very real in a good way. The music is one of the best soundtracks to a game ever - period. It's the way it fits so perfectly with the setting while also being melodically driven. + Characters Story Environments Aesthetics The Beauty Grittyness Combat MUSIC Lenght No political agendas being pushed down your throat - A bit linear Lacks open world gameplay",9,2022-01-17,PC,user

It was just so boring. I wish there was some interesting end-goal or anything that keeps you motivated while you do these basic quests, but there aren't.

BroTheHomes,"The Witcher 3 was a game I went into not really expecting to be blown away by, I've never been good at or a fan of souls-like combat (even though it isnt really souls-like), and I often prefer PLAYING more open games that allow you to do whatever you want (like a Skyrim). But I was absolutely blown away by the quality of the story and world around you, the limitless side quests there are to do, the great characters, how you can customize the way you play, the great DLC's, how your choices in game do matter in a way that doesn't directly tell you every time that the decision you just made mattered. A game like this keeps you on your toes and ready for the next quest or next plot point. It really progresses well too, from the starting town to the end of the game, everything seems to just flow together perfectly, balancing spending a long time at one point, but not too long, to leaving more that you can explore in places you haven't been too. There are several things you can just completely miss in this game without exploration and while it wont vastly affect your story, it does indeed have some impact. Everything about this game is superb and I'm a **** for games with good story and an even bigger **** for a game where your decisions matter. This is without a shadow of doubt a must play for anybody that gamer than owns a device that can run it.",10,2022-01-02,PC,user

SaintLaZboy,This is my favorite game I've played and I've played a LOT of games. The game never gets boring over the 90 hours of gameplay that I have played which were all a blast. Over all I say its the best RPG to date. Cyberpunk 2077 was a disaster for GOG so they are making a remastered version for Witcher to makeup for the Cyberpunks console versions. the remaster edition scheduled to release sometime in 2022. The games combat system was very good and the story is my favorite story of the RPGs I've played. Witcher 3 also has the most bad ass protagonist in any game I've played. I play on a PC with a GTX 970 on ULTRA at 1080p res and hit 60-70 frames per second. The Witcher 3 also contains my favorite DLCs I've played [Hearts of stone & Blood and Wine].

ARSM,"The main issue for me is that there is no Role-Playing Game, because we have no role, but being the same Witcher. The only real change is how many allies you have in the end. But you can't build-up your own story and character, not even close. Also, the team promised to deliver the world, that is believable (quote: if you kill wolves, other animals will replace them in the area). But these far cry promises aren't in the game, so it feels static and becomes dead, if you trying to complete all quests on the map. The fighting system is very innertia-based, so you need to roll and dodge all the time, rather than just hit in proper timings. Characters are medieval and very unpleasant, there is no one you can really like, adore or care about, not even close. DLCs are great though: smaller areas, deeper stories, etc.",2,2021-11-18,PC,user

SDaV24,"12/10. Лучшая игра мире. Сюжет:Очень интересная история которая затронет вас до глубины души. Сюжетные дополнения это просто шедевр, исскуство особенно Кровь и Вино . Геймплей: Довольно понятный и интуитивный.На высоких сложностях играть комфортно и используюються все аспекты игры. Графика:Просто шедевральная для открытого мира.В 2015 как и сейчас это смотрится афигенно. CD Project Red смогли показать очень проработанный мир. Атмосфера: Велен с его болотами просто шикарен и передает всю напряжееность войны. Новиград прекраснейший город выполненый в европейском стиле, когда ходиш по не му то получаеш сплошное удовольствие. Что касаеться Туссента, то здесь слова излишни это просто самая атмосферная локация во всех играх в которые я играл. Персонажи: Проработаны не только главные герои но и НПС в второстепенных квестах. Одним из таках является Кровавый Барон, боже это легенданый чел.Это просто именно тот персонаж историю которого все кто поиграл в эту игру запомнят на всю жизнь. Концовки: Все концовки хорошие по своему. Особенно та где Геральт остается без Цири. Просто берет за душу. Вариативность действий:Да єто РПГ , но не классическая в понимании того кем ты хочеш стать. Здесь не так, здесь ты отыгрываеш роль заранее прописанного героя котого раскрывали на протяжении большого количества времени. И хотя ты играеш за заранее прописаного героя, то как ты будеш влиять на этот мир зависит от тебя. Рекомендации:Однозначно рекомендую потратить все свои деньги и купить Ведьмака, а лучше все три части с DLC, потому что Ведьмак это не игра это исскуство,подобное которому мы уже не скоро увидим, а может и вовсе не увидим!",10,2021-10-31,PC,user

Las físicas son horribles, sobre todo las del caballo, con el cual te vas a pasar pegándote en cada esquina. Las pantallas de carga a veces son muy largas. En definitiva me pareció un juego agotador a más no poder. Lo que si es cierto es que tiene un mundo muy vasto y complejo y sí eres alguien que adora juegos largos con mucho que explorar y hacer, sin duda lo vas a disfrutar.

UncleEd,"I had enjoyed the original Witcher, but disliked the second game for its poor gameplay. As much as Witcher 3 generally follows the Witcher 2 formula, it is a big step up from it. Again, the gameplay is passable at best, but the more accessible open world design and removal of QTEs really help it. Movement is a bit clunky and combat is really nothing special. Yes, you can prepare potions, use signs, enchant your weapons etc. but it won’t take you long to figure out that repeatedly dodging and hitting will get you through the entire game. As a game adapted from fantasy novel series, you won’t be surprised to find great lore here, similar to previous games. There is a good variety of monsters and many encounters feel unique. Where the Witcher 3 shines though, are the cutscenes. They are very well made and watching the cutscenes (you will watch them very often) will feel like watching a pretty good fantasy themed tv show. Character development for all the characters including the insignificant side characters is very good. Overall, the game suffers from the same burnout that most open world games do. You have a map filled with question marks and generic fetch quests. Some of the best quests are secondary quests, whereas some of the worst fetch quests are within the main questline. So, you will never know what quests are worth doing and which ones you should skip, which results in completing pretty much every quest you get, which then causes burnout. Save some exceptions, I often felt like in one of the MMORPGs released in early 2000s where the game felt like homework. On the other hand, completing my homework was often rewarded with a great cutscene, which was a joy to watch. 8.5/10",9,2021-10-12,PC,user

Bushido95,"Я краб... э... кхм, крайне доволен. По сей день в игре отличная графика и не потому что она какая-то невероятная или это второе пришествие ""Crysis"", а потому что это довольно эстетично смотрится, что как мне кажется очень важно в каждой игре из-за той же эстетичности первый ведьмак по сей день графически вполне очаровательный. В DLC Кровь и Вино я даже перестал пользоваться быстрым перемещением чтоб просто наслаждаться видами как можно дольше. Геймплей увлекательный можно потеряться во времени изучая мир. Большая часть второстепенных квестов в игре на высоком уровне и ничем не уступают основным, а где-то превосходят. Многие жалуются на боевую систему, но плохой её назвать трудно как по мне она приятная без заморочек и даже чувствуются удары чего не скажешь о второй части ведьмака, но это уже другая история. Тебя не заставляют зачищать всю карту ты можешь проходить игру так как тебе этого хочется да есть сайд квесты которые можно провалить в случае неверного порядка прохождения, но последовательность интуитивно понятна. Снова упомяну DLC Кровь и Вино потому что именно там в Туссенте находится приятнее всего я получил больше всего положительных эмоции именно там. Не рекомендую ничего скипать и это также относится ко всем письмам, книгам, заметкам что представлены в игре потому что это помогает в погружении и дает ответы хоть и обрывками на некоторые интересные вопросы, что возникают по ходу игры. Атмосфера темного фэнтези присутствует на действительно высочайшем уровне и музыки в игре довольно много и она отлично вписывается под атмосферу, локации и во время битвы, а некоторые треки уже в моем плейлисте. Из минусов я бы вкратце упомянул плотву, лодку, баги и иногда скорость озвучки чудит, но это всё так не важно и ни одному олдфагу никогда не мешало главный минус для меня опишу ниже. Как и подавляющее число геймеров я познакомился со вселенной ведьмака именно с 3 части, что вызывало много вопросов по типу кто все эти люди? что вообще тут происходит? Проблема в том, что если вы даже играли в прошлые части серии, то и там вы не получите ответов на половину возникших вопросов. Основной сюжет игры при всем желании не получается оценить выше чем средний... бесспорно есть интересные, захватывающие, забавные, трогательные моменты в процессе продвижения по сюжетной линии, но после прохождения игры я так и не понял мотива Жалкой Охоты и их диснеевского злодея Эредина. На фоне других антагонистов из двух DLC Эредин это какая-то шутка. То к чему мы приходит к концу игры вызывает недоумение я даже удивился, что игра внезапно закончилась на этом моменте. Учитывая всё это и невероятно качественные DLC я всё таки остался очень доволен и получил море удовольствия. Это и правда одна из лучших игр всех времен.",10,2021-09-27,PC,user

DeniMars,"Не понимаю такого повального восторга от этой игры. Она плоха во всем, от кривого неудобного управления, до псевдо-искусственного открытого мира. На начальной локации ставить врагов с черепом на голове, которые убивают с 1-2 ударов, игрока, который только-только учится играть и привыкает к неудобному корявому управлению, это верх некомпетентности разработчиков. Смысл тогда от открытости мира, если меня насильно толкают по сюжету, а на всех значках вопросов отвешивают завышенные по уровню враги. Ну либо там просто копипаста места силы да гнезда. Нет смысла исследовать локации. Идти строго по сюжету и все, ну и делайте тогда коридорную, сюжетно-ориентированную игру. Дерганная камера, от которой голова кружиться начинает, особенно когда ГГ лезет по лестнице. Максимально убогая однообразная боевка. Ни стелса, ни каких то различий в оружии. Все сводится к маханию мечом и вечным перекатам. Даже знаки и те неудобно использовать. Через меню. В том же Ассассине умения (считай знаки) и то проще и продуманней реализованы. Вне боя Геральт за все цепляется, поворачивается как танк на месте, вечно куда то несется и упирается во все подряд. Играть невозможно. 80% всего геймплея это кат-сцены, от которых через время уже начинаешь уставать и тянет зевать. Инвентарь настолько запутанный, что черт ногу сломит. За что ей завышают так оценки, мне не понятно. Она плоха вообще во всем. Глупые НПС, которые тебя вечно толкают и в тебя врезаются, а спутники прижимаются к тебе и трутся об тебя, мешаясь постоянно. Да и НПС пустые болванки, декорации с одинаковыми лицами, которые по сути не несут никакой пользы в игре, только создают помехи. Мини карта с мелкими значками на которой ничерта не видно. Переоцененная игра. Единственно, за что можно накинуть баллы, так только за музыку и неплохие пейзажи ну и может быть сами квесты и их повествование.",6,2021-09-17,PC,user

All of the big areas are filled with detailed locations that you might even miss after your 10th playthrough. The side quests are one of the essential parts of the game in which there are no repeating elements and each one are unique and a joy to experience.

Gameplay itself sometimes may seem repetitive, due to scope of the content (all these endless question marks on Skellige) but most of it is optional.

IAmKesha,"I started this game with sceptic vision. Was thinking it's just another one blockbuster. Fortunately, I have mistaken. This is so epic game, with very dramatic story, such a perfect characters, wonderful and harmony-like music, the music is so good that I have set several tracks on the alarm. Incredible graphic, nature is so charming! I just fell in love with this game. Very good designed DLC's. Especially Blood and Wine. Toussaint. It's like a mix of France and Italy. Perfect balance. Great architecture. Nature - I have no words on this way... Okay, I swear, technically, I think these are not DLC's, those an another games. 70 hours on main campaign I spent. +50h on DLC's. Yea, it's just a game... P.S. Greetings from Russia epta!",10,2021-08-06,PC,user
Surma,"I think the game has gotten a little bit overhyped (not much). After playing through Cyberpunk 2077, I wanted to check out what this game was about, and I am able to recognize so many features that Cyberpunk 2077 got supposedly trashed for. Someone said in Cyberpunk 98% of dialogues don't lead to different outcome. Well that's kinda same for Witcher 3 as well. Just like in Cyberpunk 2077 you're mostly just able to get more information about the quest itself and surrounding areas. Maybe that style of RPG is more suitable for fantasy game where it's more interesting to have talks about fantasy creatures invading your areas than some gang members. Another thing was that the leveling system felt kinda boring and there's not really much there to maintain my interest in the game. The quests however and the atmosphere of vast open fields and well crafted dialogues is what is keeping me interested the game. I think there's just too many menu tips being shoved at you the same time when you first start the game, especially crafting system. I think for content, this game is 10/10 masterpiece, but for gameplay mechanics, I think this is around 8 category, and sure, maybe too mechanical game would ruin some of the fun in this type of game.",9,2021-08-04,PC,user

Witcher 3 released in 2015, that is after all the other hit games were already released, including Skyrim that came out 2011.

They probably feel personally attacked if someone appreciates an actually thoroughly good game, such as The Witcher 3, over their only-excellent-when-modded-favourite game Skyrim. Some people seem to bash the combat, and I'm pretty sure these individuals just went with ""red build"" and didn't bother delving into the several possible builds which really make a difference on how you approach the combat. It's actually good. The game was released in 2015, so the graphics aren't too up to date anymore, but still very beautiful. Luckily there are mods to bump up the graphics quite a bit if your PC can handle it. The story and narrative are truly masterclass.

Reviewer102,"The game deserves the attention for the vast open world that the game offers you to explore . The story is written well and characters are well fleshed out . The graphics are great and soundtrack is immersive . There are so many ways to praise this game . But enough of that as I'm sure you can find more of that by other reviewers . This game by definition is still 'overated.' People are too scared to vocalize that this game has its issues in fear of being downvoted or attacked by fans of this game series . Truth is , the combat is lacking . You dodge back and strike . You do this again and again . Combat becomes boring and a chore . The story as described above is well written no doubt but it lacks in good pacing . The story fails in pacing as you are bombarded with story after story without having time to digest the stories . It makes the stories unmemorable . The story starts off very strong as it hypes you up for an epic journey to find Ciri . But it just dissolves into nothing but unnecessarily long talks . Yes , the talking in this game is long but the talks aren't very interesting . That is the problem . Not going to sugar coat it . Romance in the game is for horny men and is cheap perfume . Not like that is 'bad,' but it somewhat gets old after a while . It is like real life marriage almost . Pretty accurate as some may say . The villains in Witcher 3 is terribly cliché . They are the stereotypical bad guys with bulky armor . They aren't that interesting as a whole . There are some villans that are intriguing no doubt though . They are so forgettable in general . Yes this game is based on a series of books written by Andrzej Sapkowski so CDPR can't do much about the villans other than change the way they are visually portrayed in the game . Witcher 3 should have not won GOTY . Games like MGSV should have won as MGSV actually had an epic story and amazing gameplay . Though MGSV comes with its flaws it still does the job better at least in gameplay where Witcher 3 lacks heavily . The game is overated and overhyped beyond understand but it indeed deserves the attention but only a fraction of it . This is why this review is a mixed score .",7,2021-06-30,PC,user

gwynbleidd27,This is the best gaming experience ever and I don't think I will ever enjoy a game this much. I loved medieval games and directly picked the witcher 3 after I saw so many people love it. Played about 8 hours then uninstalled it because I was a dumbass and didn't know how to read the book keira gives you so I was stuck and couldn't continue the main quets (I WAS DUMB I know) after some time I tried it again and from that day I have played it for about 800 hours with more than 6 playthroughs this game is just a masterpiece. the soundtrack the characters the main quests the side quests the world the atmosphere are all just perfect. I will never forget when I first got to Skellige which was a whole new region with its own people and tradition and the beautiful environment and the soundtrack that made me just walk around. This game is in my opinion is the best game of all time! 100% Recommended,10,2021-06-26,PC,user

ashwathama199,"When I first played Witcher 3, I absolutely had no idea about it. I thought of it as a Graphic Marvel, Purchased a 960 GTX in order to play it, and was blown by the graphics. But that was it, the game never interested me except for its last missions, couldn't get even a single bit of the story. Didnt even realise I did the bad ending, never touched the DLC, uninstalled the game, considered it average, and called it a day. After 4 years, decided to pick it up again, thanx to Steam which offered Tremendous discounts on these games. I first explored The story of Witcher 1, played Witcher 2 along with all side quests, found it good, Then started Witcher 3, did research about good ending, and finished almost every side quest and Question Mark. And I am happy to tell..... my opinion about this Franchise has completely changed. Witcher 3 is one of the best games ever created, which puts forward an Amazing Game of Thrones like politics on one side, and a heartwarming Journey of a Witcher- Geralt of Rivia, on the other. The unique thing about this game is the neutral nature of the protagonist, the game allows you to make choices and decide on his behalf not only in Main Quests but also in almost 3/4ths of a hundreds of non-repititive Side Quests this game has to offer, Witcher 3 perfectly demonstrates the feeling of being a contract monster killer despised by the society for its heartless nature ( which it might not be ). This is supplemented by beautiful soundtrack comprising of Folk music which adds charm to almost every kind of scene, be it a fight, romance, celebrations or some tragedy. The well developed characters, the complex chemistry between Geralt, Yennefer and Triss, and the love of Geralt for Ciri ( whom he considers his daughter ) makes it one of the most memorable games ever witnessed. The combat system manages to avoid monotony unlike most of the other RPGs where over repititive combat has always been an atrocious feature. It still astonishes me how this massive game manages to have 76 unique endings, I think no other game has ever pulled it off. Besides for some of its horrible glitches and optimisation issues, CD Projekt Red has done a tremendous Job in creating this Flawless Masterpiece, hats off from my side. Can't wait to continue with the DLC which adds almost 50 hrs of content to a game which is already very long. I think it is never late to start exploring its beauty, since this work is beyond its time. I RATE IT 9.7/10",10,2021-06-16,PC,user

Not to say that it is a bad game, just doesn't feel as perfect as ppl make it to be. The open world is in the UbiSoft school of Design, filled with world breaking jank that could srsly ruin some1's immersion. Its like they tried to mix AC and Skyrim in moderate doses, but still failed to find a great balance. Combat feels like its out of a 2005 game. There's still that horse running into a wall thingy there. Really bad. The story is pretty good though, with some really well written side quests. This is mainly what stands out for the game. There are a ton of quests to undertake and delve deeper into the lore of the world. This is mainly where the game shines. Maybe its just that I played RDR2 b4 this, character movement here feels clunky and unnatural and horse riding here is terrible compared to it.

The story is bombastic open-ended and hole-ridden nonsense - even as a fantasy title - but has loads of sex and cynicism mixed in which impresses people, I guess? If you're thinking this game is going to be a big step up from Witcher 2, you're going to be disappointed. Much of the amateurish jank is still here.

wokenoodle,"Witcher 3 is often praised for it's plot and how player choice impacts it, yet I don't feel like this praise is earned. It has mostly good dialog, interesting and charismatic characters (both leads and minor ones), somewhat effective set-pieces, but the story itself (except for the Velen chapter, which is the only one everyone tends to bring up) is kinda lacklustre. As soon as you get to Novigrad, plot treads start abruptly appearing only to lead pretty much nowhere and leave no real consequence (witch hunts, Radovid, gangs), pacing is off and characters start to crack up with small inconsistencies (mainly, Dandelion). These issues will be alleviated with Skellige's focused side plot and soft mental reset granted by the new map, but after Battle at Kaer Morhen they kick back in like an obstinate mule with a newfound force of rushing to conclude broad plot threads that shouldn't've been there in the first place. Sprinkled with some awful resolutions of essential story arks (Dijkstra, Avallac'h) and absolutely pathetic main villain - you got a really, really mixed bag of a plot, which is mostly remembered well for the Velen chapter everyone was so blow away by. My other criticisms of Witcher 3 are much less controversial: combat is too basic for such a long game, character progression inclines to highly specialise in a few from already not that many options, and enemies rarely require you to step out of that chosen specialisation. Loot system is garbage (literally). Alchemy is a double edged sword: I really appreciate that consumables replenish (it's one of the best design choices in the game), but being able to pop a decoctions whenever you want really takes away from the planning gameplay, while knowing his enemy and preparing accordingly should be one of the key witcher's abilities. And the worst offender is the dumbed down, streamlined and formulaic, almost automatic in nature gameplay loop that became pure torture towards last ten ours of my playthrough. Witcher Sense is one of the most overused and non-engaging mechanics I've ever encountered in a videogame. None of what I just said renders the game unplayable or even not fun, it's just really uninspired, mediocre and lacks coherent brave vision. The real beauty of Witcher 3, what I consider the reason people fell in love with this game, the strength of CDPR that came to be the highlight even in the disastrous Cyberpunk 2077, is the world and atmosphere. Novigrad is the best videogame city I've ever been to, you won't find more lifelike countryside than White Orchard, everything in this game looks stylish, feels evocative, sounds enthralling and plays damn immersively, even with all the grudges I hold agains it. I might not had the best gaming experience, but it was a great time - time, spent as Geralt of Rivia in wondrous, magical and dangerous lands. To sum it all up, Witcher 3 is a mediocre open world action RPG, that stole the industry spotlight for all the wrong reasons, but you won't regret loosing yourself in it for a hundred hours.",7,2021-05-06,PC,user

Mpbpl,"Sidenote: DLC has Giant Spiders! For those who suffer from Arachnophobia there is a mod on the internet. What can be told about this game that has not been said? This game created a netflix series, and put the work of Andrzej Sapkowski together with Lord Of The Rings as the biggest fantasy series worldwide, and it is easy to understand why! This is CD Project Red Magnum Opus, the graphics are astounding, the setpieces are amazing, the world feels alive, all the cities, residents, farmers, monsters, everything seems to be there for a reason and because of it the immersion on this world is instant. The characters are timeless, even those that you might not like have a backstory that makes you understand them at least. The side characters? they have the same treatment! The villains? they have the same too! Nothing and no one was created in this game just to be there! The voice acting is spot on! I can hear their voices even when I read the books. The story is really intriguing and if never played a witcher game, saw the series or read the books, it don't matter, they give enough information to make you not feel lost and at the same time not too much to feel overwhelmed.

It's so obvious why this game is actually famous and that's female nudity and this game has tons of it. I have absolutely nothing against female nudity in video games, but if that's your main selling point, then it becomes a problem. It's the exact same reason why Cyberpunk sold over 13 million copies. They said game has naked females and automatically every nerd ever pre-ordered it. It's almost pathetic how easy it is to sell your game. Just put naked females into it and it can be emptiest, most buggy game possible, but it had female nudity and sells over 13 million regardless. That's why games are dying, thanks to companies like CDproject. They over promote their games with sex and nudity, while actual game/gameplay is extremely outdated.",0,2021-04-21,PC,user
AltumSilentium,"Достойная Action RPG, полагаю понравится всем любителям жанра и в особенности фанатам книжной саги. CDPR RED очень умело продолжают с небольшими коррективами историю книг, увлекая игрока в историю. Остаться равнодушным к судьбам персонажей почти невозможно. Таким образом, сюжет, персонажи, диалоги возносят эту игру над многими другими проектами. В тоже время боевая система и развитие персонажа довольно таки ""ограничены"". Безусловно это оправдывается с лорной стороны, но разнообразия билдов вы тут не найдёте, а боевка не сможет удивить.

I had a sad loss that put me away from gaming for a whole year. but when I returned to gaming this was the game that felt like resurrection from death. completed on April 2018. but never forgotten. the music, story, characters, nature, and life in the game is something can't be found in any other game. I just completed Blood & Wine DLC on PC after telling myself that I had put the game on the shelve of memories. and dear readers you know what? this game is just a the best masterpiece a gamer can play. even now on 2021, no company will make such a game with passion.

Vegito901,"Ok now I got to be honest in this one. At first I felt At the beginning I felt that the game was too overwhelming, too big and too adult for me because I came from Skyrim, and to make a comparison was impossible because they were the ''two greats'' of the genre. I watched an advice video about the game. When I came back I was excited, and when I left White Orchard.... 210 hours are the number of hours I have played. I've played the main campaign 2 times and I'm waiting for the next-gen update to play the DLC's again. The world of The Witcher 3, the Continent, is plagued with evilness, hunger, suffering, sadness and war, that's what you see, and the folklore and richness of the world will make all this stuff charming. Thanks to the huge amount of different and side quests, enemies, how the world reacts to you and your decisions (nothing to do with Skyrim by the way), the beauty of the game itself, the characters, the story, even the gameplay, everything! This game will catch you, and when you finish it you will realize that you played the best game ever. And that if you used your time for something worthwhile. 5000 characters are too few to be able to express all the love and respect I have for this game, all the affection I have acquired for the characters and how I enjoyed the main campaign. But maybe they are enough to talk about the DLC's. Hearts of Stone is fantastic and introduces you to one of the best villains of the saga of video games, I do not want to detail more because although it is worthwhile, what I want to talk more than anything is the second DLC. And even so, it's a sin not to buy the whole game. Blood and Wine... Imagine a place where you gather the most beautiful of French, Italian and Spanish culture. That beautiful music, those colors, that attitude of the inhabitants of Toussaint... after wars and suffering, after death, you arrive in a world full of life, wealth, abundance and nobility. Someone who has a strong European identity would cry from happiness if such a place existed. Toussaint is magnificent, and I repeat it because I measure my words, MAGNIFICENT. A year after playing the DLC I am still humming the songs, I even have them downloaded on my phone and know how to play them on instrument. I already loved The Witcher 3, it was already the best game I'd ever played in my life, and then came Toussaint.... It's a near perfect game. It's magnificent. It's wonderful.

It is a very violent game, characters seem old and depressed and full of personal issues and problems. To sum it up: Pros: 1) Graphics were good at the time the game came out. Cons: 1) A depressive and sad game 2) Too much violence without good reason 3) World is just too large 4) Fighting system is unresponsive and is hugely based on stats rather than skill. 5) Characters are very boring 6) Depressive Music...",2,2021-03-30,PC,user

egorsv1,"Я фанат книг и игр про Ведьмака. И если вы не читали книг, не играли в первую и вторую часть, то вы не получите никогда тех эмоций от этой игры, которые получает игрок ознакомившийся с этой вселенной! Ну а что касается уже самой игры это просто шедевр. В третьей части появилась офигенная графика, геймплей, огромный открытый мир (в общем все довели до ума). Каждая минута игры в третьего Ведьмака доставляет удовольствие, да что уж тут - не всегда хочется включать игру пока не послушаешь песню ""В поле спят мотыльки"". Ну и саундтрек, конечно, создает неповторимую атмосферу, это касается как основной игры так и DLC (Больше всего запомнилась песня о Гюнтере О'Диме). Сюжет. (БЕЗ СПОЙЛЕРОВ) Что касается него тут тоже можно говорить бесконечно, опять же для фанатов вселенной именно он на первом месте. Наконец-то появляются Йен, Цири и многие другие важные пер-сы саги. Еще есть такая тема, что канон ли сюжет игр о Ведьмаке, я могу с уверенностью сказать, что для меня это канон. Да, в игре присутствуют концовки и другие выборы по ходу игры (Это же RPG), вот тут конечно можно и поспорить по поводу каноничности тех или других выборов. Но все равно даже после прохождения на одну концовку, хочется пройти на другую - вот в этом и фишка. И еще круто, что есть переносы сейвов из второй части, опять же не знакомые с вселенной думают это не сильно важно, а для фанов это формирует окружающий мир, смотря на результат принятых решений, ну и можно встретить старых друзей из 2-ой части)). И стоит упоминуть огромную, огромную кучу интересных доп. квестов и ведьмачьих заказов. DLC. Есть еще и 2 Дополнения ""Каменные сердца"", ""Кровь и вино"".

MurphyBrandon,"I enjoyed The Witcher 3. It's pretty good. I'll give it 8 out of 10 points. It's not flawless, though. I have five main issues with The Witcher 3: 1. The movement is not smooth. Geralt and Roach get stuck awkwardly on objects at the worst times. 2. Fast travel isn't as convenient as it could be, and I am tired of hearing the narrator repeat the same line every time I switch regions. 3. There's too much sexual objectification of women. 4. The list of achievements is not user-friendly. There are multiple achievements that have very specific requirements, and many of them can be easily missed by accident which would force a player to replay the whole game to earn all of them. Given the length of this game, that is not nice for the players. 5. When my screen is at full brightness and max gamma, I still have trouble seeing anything in the dark caves.

OncomingStorm12,"I have recently finished the Witcher 3 (I know, I'm late). And...I have some things to say absolutely. **** probably the best RPG game you'll ever play. There's a reason many, in fact, like, 97% of people would swear that this is the best game ever **** I agree. Some...some things, I would like to point out: 1. The combat, is not the best in the Witcher 3, but it is absolutely enjoyable as heck, once you get into it properly. Like, around the 10-12 hour mark is when the game will truly reveal to you, in terms of mechanics and gameplay. It is not the best, again, but remember that this is NOT Medieval Combat Simulator, its Witcher 3, a narrative-driven RPG. 2. ****, better to say, narrative, is insanely good. Hearts Of Stone is the best story I have ever experienced, and main story is amazing too. Some parts...sure, some parts slack off a bit but the game more than makes up for it in the subsequent parts. Act 2 and ending of Act 3 are adrenaline-rushes, whereas Act 1 and first half of Act 3 builds the tension up. 3. I've seen plenty of people claim that ""wItcHeR 3 iS noT aN rPg"", and frankly, I would say they do not know what an RPG means. RPG means that you get to role-play and build your character's personality as you like, not about getting to slaughter absolutely everybody you see on the street. In that, Witcher 3 is as much of an RPG as any other of the same genre. You can be a rude bastard, or a polite and helpful Witcher. You can even build and role-play any of **** wait, I think it was six, schools of Witchers (like me, for eg, am running a Bear School Tank build and I need to focus on strength and alchemy to role-play an Ursine Witcher...) 4. ALTHOUGH combat is not the best, there's still crazy depth to the combat system, and I could probably spend and entire small book outlining and pointing every single minute detail bout the system. All in all, don't listen to the negatives, they are mostly pointing out points that are not even supposed to be pointed out, like how the story doesn't connect to Witcher 2, blah blah blah. Most of what they say is utter nonsense. I had this same notion too that Witcher 3 was not good enough because it is famous, and such, but then I got into it and man. It is now my favorite game of all time, along with the rest of the like, 97-98% of gamers. When they say that this is the greatest game ever made, that is exactly how this game deserves to be referred to. Go ahead and buy it. You most certainly won't be disappointed.",10,2021-02-23,PC,user

samstrummer90,"¿Por qué witcher 3 no es un 10? Por como insulta a los jugadores con detalles de dejadez. En el mapa del tutorial hay un ciudadano que no encarga acabar con un fantasma y luego nos dice que es muy pobre, hasta ahí todo correcto para dejarnos las opción típica de hacer de buen samaritano, pero si después registramos su casa y le robamos en la cara, porque la propiedad privada no existe en este juego, vemos que en un saco en mitad del salón hay una esmeralda del tamaño de un puño y un glifo de magia. Y eso se repite durante todo el juego. El sistema de loot es nefasto en general. ¿Por qué no es un 9? Por el muro invisible de nivel que tiene el juego. En el tutorial somos capaces de matar grifos, sumergidos, huargos, humanos y apariciones pero poco después de haber matado un grifo del tamaño de un elefante no somos capaces de acabar con un miliciano mediocre ni con un enano de sacabuche según llegamos a la primera gran ciudad. Eso no tiene ningún sentido y arruina la inmersión. Habría sido mucho más lógico dar un nivel a cada enemigo, si un grifo es nivel 20, lo es siempre, si un miliciano es nivel 3, lo es siempre. El maestro en esto es Gothic 2 y Witcher peca de abusar del modo fácil y cutre de asignar niveles porque sí a los enemigos. El problema se ve también a la inversa cuando tenemos demasiado nivel para una misión y un gran monstruo que debería ser un desafío se convierte en una chorrada que ni siquiera nos da experiencia.

The movement can feel clunky at time, but that is easy to ignore because the rest of the game is so good. Your choices influence the story in major ways, and a lot of rpg games say this but end up not doing much (Cyberpunk 2077). But choices you make even right in the beginning of the game, have consequences, making this one of the most immersive games I have played. Truly stunning what CD Projekt Red managed to pull off and definitely worth a buy in 2021.",9,2021-02-18,PC,user
VogelFubar,"A lot will find this comment annoying and will find it not helpful, but to be honest, the game is waaaay too overhyped. Nothing is so special about it, even the dialogue mechanism. We have found that also in Mass Effect and Skyrim. The world of Witcher is very normal, nothing so special whether with the Atmosphere or the Landscape. I have played it until the last mission, and the fact is, i couldn't play it anymore and lost my appetite of going forward. I uninstalled it and never get back to it again. To be so overhyped about a game is not a bad thing, but too much of a thing can be harmful, just like drinking Alcohol. sorry, but I'd rather buy WinRar.",2,2021-02-17,PC,user

Gryzorz,"It took me several attemps at this game to get hooked. I initially thought ""moving feels choppy, combat system is different from what I'm used to"". I was also afraid of the grinding phase. Even though I was not impressed with the main story, once I finished it, I eventually proceeded to play to ""Hearts of Stone"", and slowly began to discover the real narrative genius. At the same time, I had also perfected a light armor built I really enjoyed. After finihing this awesome extension, I was now eager to jump into ""Blood and Wine"", and I took another punch in the face. Maybe it's because I'm getting older, but I grew more and more impressed with the writing/filming/acting of all of it. I'm an old gamer, I've played many games to the point of being unimpressed most of the time (that's what happened at the beginning I think and why I had trouble getting hooked), but this game is going to give me a long-lasting impression.

Tyson14,"The game has a huge content which gives you many hours of play and I consider that the game should not be considered as RPG, it should be considered as an open world adventure: -The best feature of the game and for what it is widely recognized is for the large number of missions it has and of which many have very interesting stories, in addition to the enormous amount of dialogues and cinematics and the possibility of deciding on various missions, Some with low impact and others that impact other missions in the future or even in the history and lore of our campaign, so I consider that the extremely positive criticisms of the game are justified and it is already among my favorite games. -It has a system of ""talents"" to specialize in various styles of combat, in addition to alchemy and crafts to create armor, weapons and potions -Has a lot of enemies and monsters -The extension of the map is quite large and the setting is incredible with variable landscapes and different villages, towns and even a complete city full of citizens -It has a card game that I really liked where you have to play with different innkeepers, vendors and game characters to improve your deck of cards Bad features: -The combat is simple to be an adventure game and the AI of the enemies is also simple and you can avoid combats only with ease just by running a little but it is compensating with the large number and variety of enemies that there are in addition to customization of the statistics and combat of our character but it is compensating with the large number of enemies -Without counting the missions of the game, basically there is no open world, the NPCS throughout the towns and cities do not do anything except for some that have some routine, they cannot even be attacked and the guards are decorative, so without missions there is nothing to do -This filling of cinematics that are not cinematics properly, if not dialogues with changes of lights and cameras, sometimes becomes tedious and time consuming",10,2021-02-13,PC,user

mrPinx,"Игра в целом неплоха, однако главный минус это отношение разработчиков к старым игрокам. На пк есть возможность загрузки старых сохранений в последущие версии игры. Т.е прошел первую часть загрузил во вторую, далее в третью. Сюжет первой части и геймплей для тех времен был очень крут. Я проходил Ведьмака 1 много раз и каждый раз было круто. Когда вышел Ведьмак 2, перенос вещей и упоминание об Адда было неплохим решением, потому что весь Ведьмак 2 это попытка вспомнить прошлое плюс политические предпосылки. И вот мы добираемся до Ведьмака 3. Есть изменения затрагивающие персонажей, однако проходя игру за Нильфгаард , совершенно непонятно куда делась Адда? И когда упоминают, что Темерия стала вассальным государством, почему не говорят об Анаис, дочери Фольтеста. Что с ней? Сам Эмгыр или Радовид убили её что-ли? Есть возможность встретить старых персонажей. Впринципе все нелохо однако вы выпускаете 2 ДЛС ""Каменные сердца"" и ""Кровь и вино"". Т.е. Ведьмак 1 я проходил выбирая шани, Геральт сам много раз говорил, что ненавидит магию и порталы, и как бы логично, что Шани лучший вариант. Шани в свою очередь утверждает, что не может быть с Геральтом по причине, что он ведьмак и постоянно не дома. Но блять! В диалоге с Трисс есть возможность сказать, что ведьмаку все надоело и он просто хочет жить как обычно. Почему перед выпуском ""Кровь и вино"" нельзя было добавить такую же функцию для Шани. Т.е. с Трисс он может жить, а с Шани нет? ОМГ! Проходя все части игры, я надеялся на тот финал, который хотел. Но разработчики сами решают как правильно и все равно на игроков. Графика, боевая система и прочее пойдет. The game is generally not bad, but the main disadvantage is the attitude of the developers towards old players. On the pc, it is possible to load old saves into future versions of the game. Ie I went through the first part and loaded it into the second, then into the third. The plot of the first part and the gameplay for those times was very cool. I've done The Witcher 1 many times and every time it was cool. When The Witcher 2 came out, transferring things and mentioning Add was not a bad decision, because the whole Witcher 2 is an attempt to remember the past plus political background. And now we get to The Witcher 3. There are changes affecting the characters, but passing the game for Nilfgaard, it is completely incomprehensible where Adda went? And when they mention that Temeria has become a vassal state, why don't they talk about Anais, the daughter of Foltest. What with her? Did Emhyr himself or Radovid kill her or what? There is an opportunity to meet old characters. In principle, everything is not good, however you release 2 DLS ""Stone Hearts"" and ""Blood and Wine"". Those. The Witcher 1 I went through choosing Shani, Geralt himself said many times that he hates magic and portals, and it seems logical that Shani is the best option. Shani, in turn, claims that he cannot be with Geralt for the reason that he is a witcher and is constantly not at home. But **** In dialogue with Triss, there is an opportunity to say that the witcher is tired of everything and he just wants to live as usual. Why was it impossible to add the same function for Shani before the release of ""Blood and Wine"". Those. he can live with Triss, but not with Shani? OMG! Going through all parts of the game, I hoped for the ending that I wanted. But the developers decide for themselves how to do it correctly and all the same to the players. Graphics, combat system and stuff will go.",7,2021-01-30,PC,user

There never been a game that brought about such a big void in one after completing it.

SouthOfBalmora,"""Hatred and prejudice will never be eradicated, and witch hunts will never be about witches."" This is the only game ever made that I would give a 10/10. It's not perfect (as no game is) but it's so close to perfection that any other score would be a disservice. This is one of very few games that deserve the title ""masterpiece"" - a journey so epic it's daunting to look back on it and consider the fact that all of that happened in the same game. Countless memorable characters, amazing quests, insane visuals, great music, atmosphere so thick you could cut it with a silver sword, and so many iconic lines that it feels like the script writers must have included everything they've previously saved for their upcoming magnum opus. Considering when it came out, who made it and what their backgrounds were - not to mention the resources they made it with - this game SHOULD have been impossible, but they did it anyway. And that doesn't even mention the DLC expansions; both of them are better than the majority of full-fledged games, with characters, storylines, settings and such variation that it puts everything else in the world of gaming to shame. Back in 2015, I remember telling myself ""I would be able to boot up this game in 10 years and still be impressed."" That has proven to be true, and something tells me the same thing will apply in another decade. Like I mentioned, it's not perfect. Roach is incredibly annoying, the controls can be funky (especially in tight spaces), the minimap's GPS can rarely be trusted, and occasionally the animations during conversations can be a bit stiff. But all of this feels like nitpicking, and are dwarfed when compared to the game as a whole. As far as I'm concerned, Wild Hunt is the peak of gaming, and question is if anything will ever be made that could rival it. I'd like to believe so, but the longer I play, the more I doubt it.

Hochbichler,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is an action RPG and the last part of the Witcher trilogy. It was released in 2015. Right off the bat, this game is my favourite video game of all time and trust me, I've played plenty of those. After the success of Witcher 2 and the announcement that Witcher 3 would be an open-world game, I was, for the third time in a row, a bit skeptical about this game. I was not sure how well this unique Witcher would work in the open-world setting. And boy, were my worries unfounded and unnecessary. I would now like to praise some of the best aspects of this masterpiece. First and foremost, the graphics is beautiful and even today, 10 years later, it can still be breathtaking. It is really polished, and the colours work amazingly with the Witcher world. And as a bonus, it was not only beautiful, but also very friendly to those with lower end PCs. The music in this game is superb. So many beautiful original songs and themes that fit the world, the story, the atmosphere so well. The crowning jewel is how the devs were able to work with the Witcher trilogy's simple and yet brilliant main theme and include it in the game in many different variations. If the graphics and music are great, then the story and characters are just superb. The main story is so interesting and diverse that I was not bored for one second of it. It brings the story of Geralt (and yes, the Witcher is Geralt's story, not Ciri's or Yen's, as the netflix bum-diddlers would like you to believe) to an epic, intense and emotional finale. What emotion will the finale awaken in you depends on your choices in the game. But the main story is by no means the only story in The Witcher 3. No, the open-world is filled to the brim with secondary quests, witcher contracts and treasure hunts, all of which are unique and fascinating. And there is just so much of it, that the full game will take you at least 150 hours to finish. That is a massive number, considering that you are not forced (or even able really) to repeat any content. Furthermore, the mammoth length of the game does really make you fall in love with the characters, the story and the world and, at the end, it will truly feel like all these adventures were your own and not Geralt's. The characters were written with amazing respect for the lore and the story, and yet they are so diverse and funny. Consider the stories and fates of: the Bloody Baron, Triss vs. Yen rivalry, the bittersweet story of the last members of the school of the wolf, Radovid, Roach, Dijkstra and countless others. The writers have done a truly masterful job. But it is not just the human or humanoid characters. Geralt is a monster slayer and the monsters play a very important part in this story. And again, the devs have delved deep into the Witcher lore, and they crafted dozens upon dozens of unique, often terrifying, sometimes funny and always fantastic monsters. The next thing I would like to mention is the difficulty and balance. Generally, I believe the game does a great job of it, offering three pretty distinct playstyles and, of course, a great many combinations thereof. As with any RPG, if you play it right, the difficulty drops with time and, by the end, the game offers me very little challenge even on the highest difficulty, but frankly, everything else is so good, that I do not mind in the slightest. The game was released without any major bugs (a praiseworthy achievement considering it's size) and all the minor bugs were soon remedied in a series of 16 free to download patches, which were made available, one every week, after the release. Each of these patches was tied to a small in-game extra content (like a new quest, or alternative appearance for a character). What a fantastic way to patch a game. And on top of that, the devs were so sure of the quality of the game and so fair to the players, that the game was released without any sort of piracy protection whatsoever. What a classy and based move. And all these positive things I have piled upon the game, make up together the most important (and illusive) aspect of them all. The atmosphere. And in Witcher 3, it is simply perfect. All the love for the story and the world, all the dedication and hard work, all the pure unbesmirched excitement is clearly visible, nay almost tangible in the game. Fantastic. As for negatives, I have noticed a few very minor and insignificant things hardly worth mentioning. Maybe the witcher senses item glow should not be visible in the cutscenes, maybe there could be a greater variety of NPC faces and haircuts, but honestly, the game is perfect the way it is. No SJW and no Microtransactions. A full PC playthrough with no fast travel took me 180 hours. This is my favourite game of all times, bar none. And frankly, I do not even dare to hope that I should one day play a game that would rival The Witcher 3. Thank you for this transcending experience. Final Verdict: 99 %",10,2024-11-10,PC,user

kiozen,"*The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt* is a masterpiece that has redefined the open-world RPG genre, taking players on an epic journey as Geralt of Rivia, a professional monster hunter. The story is rich and compelling, featuring complex characters and a detailed world that responds to player choices. The main plot, centered on the search for Ciri and the looming threat of the Wild Hunt, is complemented by equally well-crafted side quests, each with its own unique and engaging storyline.Gameplay offers a fluid and tactical combat system, blending swordplay and magic into a series of strategic moves that require skill and quick reflexes. Geralt can also prepare for battles with potions, bombs, and oils, adding a layer of depth that rewards careful planning. Exploration is open and highly rewarding, with vast regions filled with secrets, monsters, and villages that react realistically to Geralt’s actions.Visually, *The Witcher 3* is breathtaking, featuring landscapes that range from lush forests to snowy mountains and vibrant cities. The art direction and environmental details are impressive, creating a world that feels genuinely alive. The soundtrack also deserves praise, with evocative melodies that perfectly accompany every moment of exploration and **** essence, *The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt* delivers an immersive, deeply satisfying RPG experience, offering a vast, intricately crafted world that invites players to lose themselves in its narrative and landscapes.",10,2024-11-06,PC,user

The open world is great. Skellige takes a separate place in my heart. And what a great music on that location! From the minuses I can single out the wooden and not very diverse combat system.

Phuz,"Glad it was only £5. What's right? Pretty much all of it. Frame rate is a bit **** and combat is average but overall pretty good all round. What's wrong? Also pretty much all of it. It's just not fun. Riding a horse for miles, trickling story. It's so slow. It's a bit like taking an average TV show, chopping it in to 2 minute segments, then dragging each bit out over half an hour. There's just nothing happening. Just getting a very slow story fed to me in piss trickles. Very fetchy. Go here kill that, go there do that. It's really just a whole pile of boring quests. Go this place, kill the guys who are snotty with you, rinse repeat in varying forms. In about 5 hours the story has done practically nothing. World building great. Got the vibe, got the feel but for a world that just isn'tany fun to be in. It's not as bad as Breath of the Wild but it's still bad.",0,2024-09-29,PC,user
Xemnas,"I played through the entire story but without the both DLC expansions (Hearts of Stone & Blood and Wine) and I have to say, I think the game is extremely overrated. The story/lore/worldbuilding/graphics are the only good points, but for that you can also just watch a cutscene compilation on YouTube without playing the game. What I absolutely didn't like was that many decision are not clearly morally according to subsequent narration such as whether one should save the children from the witches or not, although it's actually clear: The evil baron kills himself which was his own decision and for me also pretty unexpected/unrealistic, cause his wife, who groomed children for witches, died even though the curse was lifted, so from my pov it's as redemption for her sins. Or that you have the option to spare **** Junior, which in turn suggests Geralt's bad character. I think Geralt has a rather bad character he often doesn't have much empathy (except for triss, jennefer and ciri), is arrogant, bossy, selfish and nymphomanic, not exactly the best influence or role model in my opinion. The game mechanics are completely underdeveloped and the combat system is incredibly bad, I can't really stand the game.",0,2024-09-26,PC,user

I had to temporarily switch back to DX11 to do that -absolutely horrible horse mechanics. Horse riding is probably the worst I've experienced in any game, becauseonce its stuck, its stuck.

adabhinav916,"If I were to sum up my experience with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt in one word, it would be ""masterpiece."" From the moment I delved into the richly detailed world of Geralt of Rivia, I was completely captivated. CD Projekt Red has truly outdone themselves with this epic RPG adventure.First and foremost, the world-building in The Witcher 3 is nothing short of phenomenal. Every inch of the sprawling landscape, from the bustling cities to the remote wilderness, feels meticulously crafted and alive with activity. Whether I was wandering the streets of Novigrad or exploring the dense forests of Velen, there was always something new and exciting to discover. But what truly sets The Witcher 3 apart is its storytelling. The narrative is gripping and filled with moral ambiguity, forcing players to make difficult choices that have far-reaching consequences. As Geralt, I found myself faced with decisions that challenged my sense of right and wrong, making each choice feel weighty and meaningful. Of course, none of this would matter without compelling characters to bring the world to life, and The Witcher 3 delivers in spades. From the enigmatic sorceress Yennefer to the roguish bard Dandelion, every character is expertly written and fully realized. And let's not forget about Geralt himself – a stoic yet deeply complex protagonist who I couldn't help but root for. But perhaps the most impressive aspect of The Witcher 3 is its sheer scope and attention to detail. The game is absolutely massive, with dozens of hours of main quest content and even more side quests and activities to keep players entertained. And despite its size, the game never feels bloated or overstuffed – every quest, no matter how small, feels like an essential part of the experience. Of course, no review of The Witcher 3 would be complete without mentioning its stunning visuals and immersive sound design. From the breathtaking vistas to the haunting musical score, every aspect of the game's presentation is top-notch and helps to draw players even further into its world. In conclusion, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is nothing short of a masterpiece. It's a game that sets a new standard for storytelling and world-building in the RPG genre, and one that will undoubtedly be remembered as a classic for years to come. If you haven't had the pleasure of experiencing it for yourself, do yourself a favor and dive in – you won't be disappointed.",10,2024-05-22,PC,user

TJohn,"The Witcher 3 is a solid game but not a perfect game in my view. I think the Witcher 3 does a lot of things right. The sound design (including music and voice acting) is some of the best I've ever heard, and the graphics are excellent as well, even years after its release it still compares favorably to many newer titles. The world is also incredible, with tons of cool places to discover, characters to meet, quests to do, and monsters to kill. I feel like the world CD Projekt realized in this game is perhaps one of the best in gaming history. The side quests are top of the line and there were a few standout ones that I felt like were among the best quests I've ever played. I also love that the main quest has several options to deviate depending on your choices, having a few options makes the game feel so much more dynamic. Then there was Gwent... a card game within TW3 which is more than likely the best side game I've ever played. It's integrated so well into the world that you can never touch it if you'd like, yet you can also become a degenerate gambler if you want to challenging people across the land and betting large sums of money. Now despite all this praise, I did have a few gripes with TW3. For one I didn't really like the third person viewpoint or movement controls. Something about them felt kind of clunky, and it felt like I was often getting Geralt stuck in weird places due to the way it worked. I also didn't love the leveling system or its implementation. The designers kinda just filled the world with a mix of different leveled enemies all over, so you're constantly running into enemies that are either too high or too low leveled for you to fight. This can get pretty frustrating because you're constantly having to ignore some cool point of interest because the enemies are too high level. And when you're looking for level appropriate stuff you never quite know where to go since it's all jumbled together. I also don't really like how the game follows Geralt. This is more a personal complaint, but I would've had more fun if I could've created my own character with my own head canon and lore behind him. Following Geralt was exhausting at times because I didn't play the other Witcher games or read the books, so I was constantly trying to figure out what was going on. There were tons of times where some whacky character shows up in the dialogue and Geralt already has this long backstory with them that took place off screen. You as the player are wondering who this person is, what happened between them and Geralt, etc. and they will just skip explaining that and go straight to business with a passing comment or two about the past. There were like half a dozen characters where this happened and it started to get a little annoying, it felt like I was hanging out with a friend group where everyone is in on some inside joke but me, and no one will outright tell you what the joke is, so you're wasting your energy trying to figure it out, then you finally do figure it out only for there to be another inside joke that you aren't in on. This is how the Witcher 3 felt to me. It's still a great game, don't get me wrong, but these few grievances did bother me enough to take it from a 9 or 10 to an 8. Overall though this game is a great RPG game with amazing graphics, sound, quests, and of course Gwent. It's not a perfect game, but I don't think you'll be disappointed by it if you enjoy Fantasy RPGs.",8,2024-04-21,PC,user
SilverOrlov,"Of course I recommend this game. It had its minuses before, and with the big update, in my opinion, they became more numerous, but overall, this game is an indisputable masterpiece of its time, which can be played, or replayed, in 2024 too. First, the pros: Excellent overall graphics, details of objects, houses, characters. The atmosphere, dialogue and music are generally one of the two main advantages of this game, they are beautiful. The second one is the plot and side-quests, there are very few things that really change the ending, but even without branching into 10 endings, this game gives an amazing story, both general and the “monster hunt” one. The game also has a convenient inventory (it didn’t immediately become like that, I remember), easy Gwent (finally the game gave us to lower the thing that not all players needed in a full-fledged adventure, especially for those who didn’t like dead-quests in the diary), auto-leveling (an excellent mechanic for those who level-up faster than the story goes, except perhaps for some scripted enemies) and auto-oil (well, that’s just normal, it didn’t stop me from doing it myself before). I also really, really liked both story DLC's. Made with soul and for the players, both in terms of plot and in terms of exploring a new large location in the second one. As for the disadvantages, I would include torn straight bushes (this is just a failure, it constantly infuriated me to watch these fields of sticks and rectangles instead of grass and bushes), things glow after they are taken with a witcher's look, bugs with pins not disappearing on the map when you take them . Lighting candles (a separate cauldron in hell for the one who came up with this. The whole game you constantly light these candles that no one needs), the skill tree often shows garbage or a crooked, stupid description that does not correspond to reality. Often the character simply wouldn’t dive until you reloaded, and I really don’t like his jerky turns when you press movement in any direction (it was just annoying on very small ledges and roofs). Perhaps it was just with me, but all the boats on Skellige floated backward first if you pressed forward, and then forward as it should. For many, the character Leto did not appear in the designated place and because of this a very interesting quest was lost (As I read on the Internet, this is due to the fact that the saves from the 2nd part are somehow transferred incorrectly, you need to carefully do this manually). Well, and the icing on the cake: After a month of slow play, enjoying exploring the World... my game-save file disappeared. It's just that simple. I tried for almost a day to return it, but all in vain. Then I simply replayed it from the beginning, but this left a strong negative feeling in the moment. At that time, I didn’t use cloud saving because I had a negative experience in a couple of other games when it was buggy and rolled the game back to what it was before. Well... as I said, there were some disadvantages, but in general all its advantages greatly outweigh in favor of this game. So, nevertheless, I consider it as a must-have.",9,2024-04-06,PC,user

I wasn't really into this genre before, but The Witcher's storytelling is so captivating that it turned me into a fan. I believe the game's strongest aspect is its storytelling, and back when it was released, there was nothing quite like it. It feels like you're immersed in a movie, where you have control over how things unfold, but not in a godlike way—more like real life. The key to this experience is probably Geralt, since he isn't strictly good or evil, allowing you to navigate the game in a morally gray area.

The gameplay is dull, the world is boring, there is zero urge to explore because everything is already marked with a symbol on the map.

The story is amazing - its long, detailed, features well-defined characters and doesn't lack heartbreaking moments or epic fight scenes. It is a perfect continuation of not just the previous games, but the entire Witcher Saga. Its graphics were already stunning in 2015, but are now far better with the next-gen update. The scenery of this games is insanely good - you can almost feel the climate changing yourself as you traversethe swamplands of Velen, through the plains of Novigrad and Oxenfurt, the gorgeous Skellige islands and Kaer Morhen in the far north. I cannot express with words how great this aspect of the game is. The music perfectly fits in with the slavic feel (obviously) the game has.

MasajaMasta,"I will tell you something. I thought this game was overrated for almost the first 100 hours (something like 1/3 of the game for me, I play slow) that I put into it... But then... I understood. I kept measuring this game and everything in it by comparing it to other titles. Then I somewhat stopped... Because I was simply getting too much of something else that was just so unbelievably high for, like, all the time. Something uncommon. And I finally understood everything. The most consistent-keep-suprising-deep-well-thought-world-and-characters than in any other video game maybe ever... Because I was playing for soo long... And the game, characters, stories... Everything kept getting better. And how all of this can also be non-linear and connected to each other in such a big game like this is... Just beyond me... Like, to this point, I didn't even think something like this on this level is even possible. Quests were almost all so interesting and tasteful and non-repeating and real like nowhere else. Like, each one, even the smallest, had a much better story than main stories in almost every game... ****, even better than movies... ( and definitely better than anything in the Netflix series but that's beside the point:) ) Like... I am not sure how to describe it... The writers aren't trying to give characters gimmicks so you could easily quickly say: ""I know, so this is THAT type of character""... It's like they don't try... they just act and speak like real people, not video game characters. Like they are from real flesh and blood. It's like this world IS real. It's like you feel them (and not in a cheap way when the writers clearly tell you how you should see their characters and you are a bad person if you aren't just assuming and believing and acknowledging what the writers with their biases want because it's all just so surface-level and stupid:) ). Like, you really feel the characters as people in this game. You understand them. The world and them are just so... Really interesting:) And from that point on... You completely understand why this is the kind of game that destroys other games for you. Makes you smart enough to see what is possible and how other companies really treat you like dumb gamers and just look down on you (especially when they don't give you stories and characters but just safe propaganda with things trying to pretend it's a story and keep using sex, race or sexual preference as shields so they can call you a bad person if you criticize something). Damn... I could just talk and talk about this game. I get why people dislike it. They just don't get it and focus on criticizing the fighting system ( play on the hardest difficulty, it's a must, I am so glad I listened to someone before and chose it ). People dislike it fast because they assume a completely wrong attitude towards it. And, unfortunately, that's pretty normal for them because they really don't have anything else so adult in gaming to compare it to. So they aren't quick to see why... This is THE GAME. I know because it also happened to me:)",10,2023-10-24,PC,user

OgnistyKamilek,"A classic nowadays and definitely a must-play. The Witcher 3 is an example for games that also try to be big but fail in terms of activity. The plot was good and the side stories were even better. The side missions were always top-notch in terms of the plot, they were interesting, and I don't know if there was a mission that made me want to finish it as quickly as possible. I always enjoyed these tasks because they were really good. Witcher orders are also missions that are worth our attention. I consider them very interesting, especially since the rewards are always on the same level. Throughout the entire game, I always had one reservation and that was the character development. I felt a bit stuck when it came to Geralt's abilities. On the one hand, I felt that how could such a badass not be even more badass? On the other hand, I explained it to myself that, in terms of immersion, Geralt already has a lot of knowledge from the beginning. Either way, I recommend the game.",9,2023-09-18,PC,user

NZXD,"Story: The main quest of rescuing Ciri could be seen as a missed opportunity for an open world game. Wow, Geralt, look at this expansive and breathtaking map... BUT HURRY, THEY ARE ABOUT TO KILL HER! But take it easy... why not take a break and play some cards? Why not visit the tavern, share stories, and enjoy the world around you? - BUT HURRY, THEY ARE ABOUT TO KILL HER! Protagonist: Geralt is portrayed as an exceptionally skilled and cool character. Geralt is cool... I wonder if maybe a bit too much. It's common in most role-playing or open world games to start as a nobody and gradually become someone, building and defining your character along the way. This can be a highly satisfying experience. When you envision how you will design and develop your character, and finally witness their full growth, it feels amazing. It reflects all the hours and effort you've invested in the game. However, in The Witcher 3, you begin as Geralt at level 1 with 5 spells and 2 swords, and after countless hours, you end up as Geralt at level 35 with 5 spells and 2 swords. The only difference is that, mysteriously, the latter feels ineffective and unable to face any challenges, despite being Geralt of Rivia, the legendary witcher with years of experience. For instance, I can easily defeat a griffin without any issues, but then I enter an area where I supposedly shouldn't be, and a dwarf bandit kills me. At a certain point, you question whether the leveling system was necessary in this game, if it was included simply because other games have it, and if it truly aligns with what a witcher is supposed to do. If perhaps they should have focused on depth in other aspects of the game instead. Inventory and Rewards: I'll be clear: On which planet, in which corner of the known universe, is the inventory system in this game considered acceptable? How many crafting materials does Geralt carry? I often find myself not knowing what half of the items I take are for. Does the game genuinely expect me to have the energy to read and learn the purpose of each item? Instead of being a game with 5 significant options, it presents us 100, and in the end, I find myself performing the same actions in every battle. As for the open world... Rather than exploring by gazing at the horizon, I'm constantly guided by a minimap with markers indicating where to go.",6,2023-07-11,PC,user

gamakazil,"A Timeless Masterpiece - 10/10 There are very few games that have the ability to capture a player's heart and soul quite like Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt. As a yearly ritual, I find myself compelled to return to this enchanting world, and with each playthrough, my admiration for this work of art only grows. The most captivating aspect of Witcher 3 is undoubtedly its story. The narrative is rich and engaging, weaving a complex tapestry of characters and plotlines that keep you enthralled throughout the game. The attention to detail in every quest is simply astonishing, and the depth of emotion conveyed by each character is unmatched. The game effortlessly delves into themes of love, loss, and redemption, resulting in a story that resonates deeply with its players. However, a great story alone does not make a game outstanding. Witcher 3's gameplay is meticulously crafted to complement the narrative, offering an experience that is tailor-made for THE Witcher. Every aspect of the gameplay loop and character development is designed to immerse you in the world that the developers have so painstakingly created, making it impossible not to become fully invested in Geralt's journey. The combat, exploration, and RPG elements are all seamlessly integrated, allowing players to experience the game in a way that feels entirely authentic. Each element of the gameplay, from the potion brewing and monster hunting to the choices you make in dialogues, is carefully aligned with the lore and the story that the game is trying to tell. This level of commitment to immersion is what sets Witcher 3 apart from other games in the genre. From the hauntingly beautiful opening scene in White Orchard to the poignant moments shared with Yennefer in Corvo Bianco, Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt is a game that I will continue to play and cherish year after year. It is a true testament to the power of storytelling in gaming and a shining example of what can be achieved when developers pour their heart and soul into a project. If you have not yet experienced this masterpiece, I cannot recommend it highly enough.",10,2023-04-25,PC,user

The choices you make actually matter, leading to different outcomes and endings. But it's not just the story that's impressive. The world of The Witcher 3 is vast and beautiful, with stunning landscapes and intricate details. Every corner of the map is filled with secrets, quests, and monsters to slay. And speaking of monsters, the game's creature designs are simply amazing. Combat is a perfect balance of strategy and skill, with various weapons and abilities to master. You'll need to think on your feet and adapt to each battle, making it all the more satisfying when you emerge victorious.

gamerz4life,"The Witcher 3 was barely out before being hyped as the absolute pinnacle of RPG-gaming, a must play for everyone & you needn’t bother playing Witcher 1 or 2 before playing 3. Naturally it gets picked as 2015’s GOTY. Who knew it was possible to win more than 800 awards for a video game? Those who say these things clearly haven’t played many video games, not to mention RPGs, let alone Witcher 1&2, which are both far better than Witcher 3 Its biggest sin is being an open-world game. They did this to compete with games like Dragon Age: Inquisition (2014’s GOTY) & Elder Scrolls: Skyrim (2011’s GOTY). Too much time was spent on building this massive world that not much thought was given on how they would fill it. It was empty & incredibly tedious to trek across the map between missions. You’ve done wrong when the player chooses to fast travel everywhere rather than go on foot. You’re also forced to find a sign post in order to fast travel, you can’t just do it from the map. An open world usually means cutting meaningful quests & characters, which Witcher 3 did in spades; the biggest being no Scoia’tael/Iorveth. In addition, the AI chatter was enough to make me go mad; the same lines repeated over & over w/ the same voices. I can say them in my sleep. The cutscenes were supposed to be Dandelion but for some reason aren’t done by his voice actor, the guy doesn’t even sound close. The combat is atrocious, when you feel that the better option is to hack, slash & roll like a ballerina rather than use tactics because the enemies aren’t known for their brains. The use of potions/oils was practically nonexistent until halfway through because you don’t get the crafting diagrams & by then you’ve learned to cope w/o so you don’t even remember that you can now use them. Meditation is not to make potions but to reload your stock using alcohol in your inventory. Tutorials would have been immensely helpful rather than a block of text you’ll never remember. Negotiation is senseless, “A bit high… We’re almost there.” The upgrade system is a complete joke. What’s the point in investing in skills when you can only use a few? Getting to level 30 you can use 12 skills and yet I had many more! You literally need to use a slot in order to have food/drink heal you over time! What? That was just a given in the other games. The story absolutely requires you to have not only played the first 2 games but that you’ve read the books as well. I can’t imagine what anyone could have gotten out of this game otherwise. But even though I had the knowledge of the whole story, I felt this game’s story was super weak. They were trying to tell too much & pull in the worst parts of Sapkowski’s books. The first 2 games felt like CDPR was adding to the story of The Witcher and telling their own tale, they weren’t just making the books a game, rather they continued Geralt’s tale a few years after the books. But with this game, it felt the complete opposite. They were now pulling everything they could from the last 2 books (which were awful) & pulling phrases & jokes from every form of entertainment in the real world. It seriously hurt the story. The idea of Ciri traveling between worlds, including our own is just stupid, they could have rewritten something so much better. Instead what was once a dark fantasy is now science fiction. It was very obvious that they had a completely different writer this time around. Despite calling itself an RPG, there were no significant choices in this game. Sure there were 3 different endings for Ciri’s fate but as to how those endings were decided, it was a couple small things in conversations rather than actual decisions. It really makes you feel good when you read the wiki and see ‘You can choose whatever you want here, it makes no difference to the story.’ When a choice cutscene would randomly pop up, it felt more like a whoops we forgot to give this meaning so here’s a choice that **** either way. The game is at 4.02 & still buggy. The choice scenes are at a far lower volume than the rest of the game, it’s a miracle if you can hear them w/o subsequently blowing your eardrums out when it switches back to the actual game. There is so much clipping, things disappearing from NPC’s hands or hovering in front of them, animals including Roach would appear in the middle of a conversation with an NPC, etc. What exactly did they fix? Now how can we talk about Witcher 3 w/o mentioning the card game Gwent? What a truly horrendous, time-wasting addition. It was clearly there to pad out the game time. You’re forced into your first game to ‘learn’ the directions & I came away no wiser as how to play. All Gwent did was make me miss dice poker. In the main game alone, I completed 141 quests in 104.8 hours. I would only recommend for the serious Witcher fan b/c all I can say is thank the Eternal Fire I’m done, I’m headed back to Witcher 1&2",5,2023-04-07,PC,user

Однако сплошные положительные отзывы, как от игроков, так и от критиков заставили меня пересмотреть свои интересы и все же окунутся в мир Ведьмака. Я еще никогда так не ошибался.. С чистой совестью можно назвать Ведьмака Лучшей игрой не только от CD Projekt RED, но и вообще лучшей игрой десятилетия! Игра без изъянов, которая может выйти (а может и не выйти) раз в поколение. Настолько детальный и кропотливый созданный мир. Каждая деревушка, каждый город, каждая тропинка, каждая речка и каждая чаща ни на секунду не дает вам ощущения, того что вы сидите за монитором, а не скачете на Плотве мимо этих красот. А саундтрек усиливает эти и без того острые ощущения, идеально гармонируя с происходящим на экране. Каждый , даже второстепенный квест, сделан с любовь и в ручную.

The story is well written and keeps you awake all the time, each cut scene feels like you are watching a movie. The gameplay is excellent is what you expect from an RPG game. The game has a unique feeling that it builds an atmosphere for the player and you feel that you are part of this journey.

Witcher 3 has the best side quests, contracts, graphics, combat and much more compared to the older games, though I find the main story alright, not super good.

The main quest kept me interested throughout the entire playthrough, and barely faltered. I also love the exploration, combat, and leveling of this game. While neither three stand out as spectacular, I thought they all worked well together. The sidequests in this game are also super strong. Witcher 3 isn't on the same level as New Vegas in terms of sidequests in my opinion, but it's easily the game that has come closest. It's an overall super strong package that offers hundreds of hours of content. I absolutely love this game, and I cannot recommend it enough.",10,2023-01-08,PC,user

Mindurbidniss,"Awesome game. Game of the decade? Hell no, it's full of euro-jank and character movement and animations are nowhere near the level of Red Dead Redemption, but there's a level of agency to be found in this game that existed nowhere else at the time. Combat is incredibly ""of the time"" consisting of hit, roll, and dodge mechanics reminiscent of Assassin's Creed. This system leaves so much to be desired considering the implementation of potions and concoctions that were barely utilized, even on the Blood and Broken Bones difficulty. The graphics are also nothing to sneeze at. Released in 2015, this game still gives more graphically intense titles a run for their money. Add that to an open world, brilliant quest design, and characters with multiple levels of depth to them and you've gotten yourself a title that punches way above what was expected of it, judging by the previous. Side quests also play a large role in The Witcher 3, which is great because side quests are where this game shines. Due to multiple choices which lead to multiple outcomes, each playthrough of The Witcher 3 is different. Some side quests even surpass those that are essential to the main story with their intricacies and decisions driven pathways. Ultimately The Witcher 3 is a game to own, or at least a game to experience. The player driven choice aspect is enough to entice the curiosity of many a gamer. Is it as good as most publications would leave you to believe? No, not at all. But it is a game worth getting lost in. A game you'll play and lose track of time with. Even a title you'll find yourself returning to year after year because of the quality that lies underneath it's many flaws.",7,2023-01-05,PC,user

Ratelate7,"Had potential, but is let down by a few things. The deal-breaker for me was the implementation of some less than savoury relationships time and time again, which were so shameless and ham-fisted by the writers that I couldn't reasonably approve of. Questlines are generally samey and boring, consisting of staring at a glowing line on the ground or walking into a sequence of designated combat areas until the quest resolves itself. Most locations also follow a ""formula"", which means you're rarely going to discover a new location and find something out of the ordinary, rather than just one of the eight or so categories that new locations tend to fall under (like a monster nest or bandit camp). The characters are developed and intricate, seeing as how they've had a series of novels and games to be constructed, but there's always one or two scenes with them that sort of puts me off them as a whole. The graphics are very good for the year it was released, and it's a very polished game mechanically and thematically. Unfortunately, the ""minor things"" and ""nitpicks"" eventually build up to become very noticeable, and this means that the experience eventually becomes too cynical for me to enjoy it. The music is okay, but nothing special, with some of the tracks widely regarded as amazing seeming too emotional and movie-like for my tastes.",4,2022-12-21,PC,user

fray_bentos,"I was really excited to play this game after enjoying other open-world action-RPG games such as Zelda:BotW and OoT, AC:Origins/Odyssey, God of War (2018), Horizon: Zero Dawn, Batman Arkham games and GTA:V. I waited for the ""next-gen version"" to release. The game looks gorgeous, and some of the story and character development seems very good (though a bit long-winded for me). However, I play games to play them, not to watch them. My main bugbears are: The combat and character movement/interaction with the world is clunky, buggy, and frustrating. The inventory system is overly complicated. There is an overwhelming amount of stuff to do. Sections of the game are gated off by levels (as enemies become too tough to tackle). Ultimately, much to my surprise, I find the game dull and boring, and I am not finding it fun at all. After reading around it seems that many people have the same experience with the same issues flagged. Many of the game mechanics are very similar to in the AC games, but I often felt that they were done better in the AC games, especially the combat, inventory/loot system, and hunting for clues. Then, I hit a bug where I hit a black screen fast travelling between sign posts; a bug that apparently dates back to 2015... I uninstalled and moved on to other games in my backlog. In the future, I will look for action RPGs where the action and gameplay takes a more central role. I found Red Dead Redemption dull for similar reasons. Not for me.",3,2022-12-20,PC,user

Drakelio,"They just chose the worst way possible to deliver this ""free upgrade"". 1) They put it over (crushing) the original game code, (they could have added it as a separated game, like with the Bioshock games, or The Elders Scroll). 2) They made it mandatory. If you don't want it or if your PC was just-enough to play the original game, with these update you are screwed, as it will drain more resources and you have no choice about it. 3) They will break all the mods that you have installed, and again you can't just choose to turn the ""free upgrade"" off. 4) They took the change to also force-feed you their ""RedLauncher"", yet another annoying software that wasn't on the original game when I bought it. 5) They broke steam overlay. When I try to open it inside the game it's like it tries to do so (because it produces some kind of ""obscuring"" over the game), but fails to open it. This is more like a ""Free upgrade either you like it or not, just gulp it down (or throw the game you bought) because we say so"".

Chalkbrood,"How does a studio put so much money and effort into something and have it come out so wrong? The story and the writing is mostly just fine (generic high fantasy with stupidly limited options during sidequests) People drool and clap for this garbage like it's somehow revolutionary but it came out in 2017 and it fails to do things that games in 2002 were capable of. It's impossible to know where to start breaking down how awful the gameplay is so I'll just write a list of bullet points: -your horse's pathing is awful even when it's supposed to be automatic -the horse has a stamina gauge and I really cannot fathom why, it only comes up during a couple racing sidequests and those are so easy that it's pointless, so this mechanic just gets in the way of regular gameplay simply because there is a badly designed sidequest that it's relevant to -draw distance is miserable in some areas -npc dialogue is moronic and irrelevant, you will be fighting side by side with people and saving their lives for some pointlessly dull quest and they will shout things like ""sorcery! he's a witch"" -every bad thing that already exists about open world games is basically still present, most quests are shallow and bland, everybody waits for an eternity for you to do things cause you're the only person who can, etc etc etc -the basis of the game is that you are a witcher, a person who hunts monsters, and monster hunting contracts are miserably repetitive and uninteresting -there's an alchemy system that begs for your inventory to be cluttered, you will never ever remember what ingredients you need cause it's always just some flower or some blood or teeth or whatever stupid thing and it won't be relevant for 5 hours and then you'll need one if you want to craft some semi useful item, this wouldn't be so bad but you have a weight limit and inventory management is terrible in this -everything is weirdly dark, even during daytime, I found this unplayable without mods -the main character comes across like an idiot cause some moron dev decided that he should constantly be shouting out combat taunts -seriously the inventory management is awful, when you're looking at different weapons and armor it doesn't even show you a full stat comparison of what you're looking at and what you're wearing -a lot of sidequests have completely unsatisfying conclusions and it feels like it's because there are questions you're just not allowed to ask, like there's some forced stupidity so that no matter what there's something bad that happens. Save the orphans? a village is destroyed. Save the village? orphans are eaten. can you talk to the spirit that's gonna eat orphans and stop it? no. can you talk to the spirit about why it would destroy the village or ask it its motivations? no -incredibly convoluted, here is a snippet of what I did early game: I'm sent by a king to get his daughter. someone who has information about that daughter won't give it to me until I help him find his daughter and wife. I have to go ask two other people for help. one of them makes me find his goat before he helps me. then the guy with the information that I need reveals that I have to help him save the soul of his wife's miscarriage. then him and the guy with the goat ask me to go to a swamp. then I meet a little boy who knows another little boy who knows about some witches who want me to kill a creature that lives under a tree in another city. by the end of that paragraph did you remember what I originally set out to do? -weapon degradation, not necessarily a bad mechanic but it doesn't even matter in this cause there are so many weapons that are so similar that you just keep picking up so why is weapon degradation in the game? because the devs add terrible things without thinking -you gain abilities but you're capped at how many you're allowed to equip, this is like being in a sandbox and someone coming by and saying ""no no, you can't use the shovel and the bucket at the same time"", this is a terrible mechanic -seriously dialogue is terrible sometimes, ""you have to find dudu to find dandelion to find ciri"" ""I'm going to go talk to **** jr."" were two back to back pieces of dialogue, it's like the characters weren't even interacting with each other -terrible ""detective"" mechanic during monster hunts wherein you hold a button that lights up what you're supposed to do so that you don't have to use your brain. it's mind numbingly dull it's too bad, I was quite engaged and I wanted to see where the story was going but I just couldn't stomach how godawful this game was at every turn",4,2022-12-11,PC,user

Glemdal,"Best game I have every played. The characters, story and atmosphere are all amazing. Almost everything in this game feels like it was made by developers who actually cared about the game. The sidequests, especially are some of the best in modern video game history. The world is also excellent, it can sometimes even be a bit overwhelming with so many things to do. However if you just give the game the time it requires, I'm sure you will be satisfied. I'm saying this because because on my third playthrough I did literally everything in the game and that took 140!! hours. Just the mainstory takes between 50-60 hours, which in my opinion is amazing because I obviously enjoyed it so much. Everything can't be perfect though, that game will never exist. My 2 biggest criticism for the game is that the combat can sometimes feel lackluster, it doesn't get in the way for me and I mostly enjoy it but it's clear that it isn't at the same level as the writing or the atmosphere. The 2nd thing is that the final act of the main story can feel a bit rushed, I know that sounds silly after I just said that the main story takes between 50-60 hours to complete, but at least in my opinion I felt that the story moved a bit to quickly in the final act and it would have been cool to explore some more things in that act without mentioning any spoilers. To conclude, this is the best game I have ever played. I am no game-critic´, this is just an honest opinion, coming from a 21 year old guy from Sweden. No game has ever had the impact the Witcher 3 has had on me. After I finished this game I obviously played it again because you have to, but besides that I also played through both Witcher 1 and Witcher 2, and read the books. I can wholeheartedly recommend all of that, it was an amazing experience from start to finish. Thank you CD Project for letting me experience your masterpiece.",10,2022-11-25,PC,user

A year passed and I decided to give the game a second chance as friends were praising the game and there were very positive reviews everywhere.

But then you return home and feel that inner peace, knowing you are where you belong and actually wanna be?

I had a lot of trouble with the high settings, but I could clearly see the pores on Geralt's skin, their rustling is visible on the wooden floor or fence, that they are not polished, but unfortunately I could not play on such settings. Then, when you start the game, you will plunge headlong into the plot, into witchy abilities, into magic, into the wars of kings and even into the problems of ordinary people. You take all the tasks from the bulletin board or they appear during your wanderings from people in trouble, but sometimes it turns out to be a trap and bandits can attack you. Tasks are divided into different types, these are: basic, additional, witcher orders, treasure hunting. The main ones are plot tasks, additional ones are tasks from the bulletin board or from people in trouble, witcher orders are tasks related to monsters, monsters, ghosts, that is, with the other world. Treasure hunt is a task for the witcher's equipment. Judging by the above, you probably realized that the world of the Witcher 3 is very open. The map is huge that even sometimes on horseback you can run for a very long time. Along the way, you may encounter abandoned villages, monsters, bandits, deserters of war, aggressive animals. The map also shows places that are unknown and there may be treasures or something worse like a monster lair, or chests tied to barrels thrown into the sea so that they do not go to the bottom, which also have a lot of useful things. There is an opportunity to move by boat on the water surface. You will also put equipment on Geralt's horse Roach, which give different effects like resistance to panic when monsters are nearby, the capacity of your bags and the speed of the Roach. Also in the game there is a mini-game called gwint - this is a card game on the board, but not an ordinary card game, each card has different strength, different abilities, where you will play either for money or for rare cards with which your additional tasks will be associated. The game has a crafting system, but without recipes and ingredients you can't collect anything worthwhile. Starting with alchemy, where you can create different drinks that give you positive effects, like accelerated regeneration, cat vision, creating bombs and oils against monsters, people and ghosts, ending with forge craft, where you can create weapons and armor for yourself. But only now you can create armor and weapons thanks to the blacksmiths that you will find in villages or cities. Blacksmiths also vary in specialization (blacksmith in weapons, blacksmith in armor) and skill level. The higher the master's level, the more high-level items he can create from your found recipes. The witcher also has a book called ""Bestiary"" in which all the monsters are listed and how to fight against them, but basically information about one of them is entered there when you kill the monster, and not before the battle with it begins, so it will be hard for you with some monsters and you will have to climb into Google.",10,2022-10-17,PC,user

Die Quests sind wirklich genial, die Story hat einen sehr gut durchdachten Faden, sie bleibt spannend und ist komplex. Ich hatte so viel Lust mit Geralt durch´s Land zu ziehen, dass ich alles gemacht habe, inklusive alle DLC-Enden. Die DLC´s sind auch super, im ersten bleibt man zwar größtenteils einfach auf der Hauptmap, aber im Zweiten hat man nochmal eine echt große Welt in der es auch von Nebenquests nochmal ordentlich viele gibt. Das konnte schon ein Standalone sein. Geralt ist auch einer meiner Top 5 Videospielcharaktere geworden, es ist bei allen schwer zu sagen, wer auf welchem Platz ist, also kann ich nur sagen von den Charakteren, der Story und dem Gameplay her 1A mit Sternchen, perfektes Game!",10,2022-09-06,PC,user

briiiz,游戏从方方面面描绘了一个生动的猎魔人世界，从主线到支线，再到各个地方藏匿的文本资料，无一不是在塑造这个世界观，玩家探索这个世界的流程设计的十分优秀，尤其是他的支线设计，一方面都会引向一处新的地点供玩家探索，另一方面会需要玩家更具自身道德标准和已有信息来作出抉择，而这个抉择又会很大程度影响后面发展，给人一种这是自己创造的故事的代入感，也让杰洛特成为了一个被玩家所塑造的角色。 但是巫师也不是完美无缺，他登场的角色中有大量来自前作和原著的人物，而人物关系却又经常不解释，同时一部分动画演出有些跳脱，让玩家经常会出现暂时不理解剧情的情况，好在可以查看图鉴来帮助理解,10,2022-08-31,PC,user

Dudesssr,"Ведьмак 3 Срать Охота The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt это лучшая action/RPG в 2015 году. CD Projekt RED переплюнули практически всех в плане визуала. Сюжет Начало сюжета достаточно спорное если играть после второго Ведьмака, но это не значит пролог плохой наоборот там своя атмосфера. Сюжет хорошо закрепляет и заканчивает трилогию. Однако фанатам Анджея Сапковского сюжет может не зайти так как стиль повествования не тот. Графоний Как било написано сверху CD Projekt RED переплюнули практически всех. При работе над игрой «Ведьмак 3: Дикая Охота», с помощью ZBrush создавались детализированные модели персонажей с большим количеством полигонов, что занимало две-три недели работы художника в зависимости от сложности модели что достойно похвали. Геймплей Обычный RPG можно бегать, прыгать нажмите пробел, ездить верхом, переступать или обходить бордюр даже плавать можно. На прохождение основного сюжета игры требуется около 50 часов а, если проходить второстепенные квесты 100—120 часов.

LoadOfRubbish,"Прошёл эту игру 3 раза, но всё равно не смог всё исследовать. Масштабный открытый мир, в котором вроде бы много качественного и интересного контента, но всё же он кажется пустоватым. Большую часть занимают леса, равнины, и мелкие деревушки, в которых редко встречается по настоящему качественный контент. Боевая система скучна и однообразна. Спам ЛКМ, или просто нужно зажать ту же кнопку при определённом билде, на ней зацикливать внимание нету смысла. Эта игра цепляет совсем другим, а именно кинематографичностю. Камера всегда расположена отлично, высокого уровня анимации, диалоги, озвучка персонажей, вот на что в этой игре стоит обращать внимание. Каждый персонаж имеет за собой какую-то историю, поэтому рекомендую сначала прочитать книги, а только после начинать прохождение, так как будет очень много моментов в которых можно просто не понять суть. Сюжет в этой игре это просто нечто, люди которые работали над сюжетом просто гении. Была проделана настолько огромная работа, что в некоторых сайд квестах сюжет лучше чем, основной сюжет некоторых ААА проектов. Геймплей. Многие называют эту игру ""Лучшая РПГ за всю историю"", но стоит понимать, что эта игра вообще в принципе не РПГ, только разве что в моментах когда отыгрываешь ведьмака, но это происходит не часто. Я бы назвал этот жанр ""слэшер с элементами РПГ"". Боевая система в этой игре просто дно, типичный слэшер, сначала уворачиваешься, или парируешь атаки противника, бьёшь, потом опять уворачиваешься -> бьёшь, и так пока не убьёшь противника, наглядный пример это битвы с големом на низких уровнях. Выбор в этой игре есть и он влияет на события, но он довольно странный в некоторых моментах. Выбор может повлиять как на моменты не относящийся до основного сюжета, как например выбор между Трисс и Йеннифер, так и на концовку влияют некоторые выборы . В этой игре, как и в многих подобных есть настольные игры. Здесь это ККИ ""Гвинт"". Очень интересная мини-игра, которая позже переросла в самостоятельную ККИ по мотивам вселенной ведьмака. Багов в этой игре очень много, начиная просто с визуальных, заканчивая багами влияющие на геймплей. Например у меня был такой баг, что персонаж просто переставал бить, не знаю был ли у кого-то другого такой баг, но у меня он случался не часто, но всё же неприятно, чтобы решить проблему нужно было выйти из режима боя, или перезагрузить сохранение. В целом, эта игра имеет много проблем, на которые разработчики просто забили, но все эти минуса нивелирует шедевральная кинемотографичность. Все персонажи чувствуются живыми, за них переживаешь. Сценаристы просто гении, многие моменты продуманы до мельчайших деталей, в пример можно привести момент с туалетом возле замка Вроницы. В итоге моя оценка 8/10.",8,2022-06-17,PC,user

Great game loved every bit of it the world is beautifully made, quests are unique and even some are quiet funny, it has a lot of markers on every map and can get sometimes tedious if you want to complete it (looking at Skellige).

It is the sequel to the 2011 game The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings and the third and final main game in The Witcher video game series, played in an open world with a third-person perspective. The games are based on The Witcher series of fantasy novels written by Andrzej Sapkowski. The game takes place in a fictional fantasy world based on Slavic mythology. Players control Geralt of Rivia, a monster slayer for hire known as a Witcher, and search for his adopted daughter, who is on the run from the otherworldly Wild Hunt. Players battle the game's many dangers with weapons and magic, interact with non-player characters, and complete quests to acquire experience points and gold, which are used to increase Geralt's abilities and purchase equipment. The game's story has three possible endings, determined by the player's choices at key points in the narrative.",10,2022-03-21,PC,user

Give yourself a shield, use the right consumable for the given enemy type, and that's basically it. The character progression is just unsatisfying and boring. I got 8 hours play time and just quit. I didn't even had high expectations for the game, because I know how overdramatic and overhyped gamers get and how they like to throw around 10/10. It is at best a slightly above average game and that's it, just like cyberpunk (after like 1.5 years of beta testing).

Главного героя сделали как канонично почти бесчувственным, так и интересным, живым и человечным. Это невероятно. Сюжет настолько драматичный, что ты понимаешь чувства героев, и самое главное - понимаешь Геральта из Ривии - главного протагониста всей великой и воистину легендарной саги. CD Project Red умудрились почти точно перенести книжный роман пана Анджея Сапковского в серию игр. Итог: игра шедевральна и неповторима настолько, насколько шедевральна и неповторима любовь.

Kostas_Spirou,"An amazing journey of a monster hunter in every way possible. The main story is very well made with a great cast of characters, and the writing is fantastic, everything in the game has depth to it. The amount of content is absolutely ridiculous, at first you might get overwhelmed by all the activities the game throws at you, but exploring the map and doing side quests is definitely worth it, this game has perhaps the best side quests I've ever experienced, and the quest design is phenomenal. The dialogue options are groundbreaking, almost every quest has different outcomes and interactions, it's insane. Your actions have consequences and if you're not careful, you can miss entire questlines that can alter your experience. It's an all-around solid game, it does almost everything very well, except from the gameplay which is a little bit clunky so you'll have to get used to it, and some animations look weird. The biggest problem I have with the game personally is the amount of filler and padding in the first half of the story, it takes way too long for it to pick up, but the last few hours are just incredible. Also the boss fights are disappointingly simple and easy, no challenge whatsoever. Top Tier Open World in my opinion, it's very enjoyable from start to finish, there are so many things to do in this game. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt achieved the impossible, it's unbelievable how a small Polish studio managed to create this monster of a videogame.

Fvnfvnfvn,"One of the most engaging and interesting RPG's I've ever played, and I didn't even get to make a custom character. The Witcher 3 stands proudly above all other RPGs and rightfully so. Its brooding dark setting are beset by its colorful cast of characters and wonderful writing which can range from fairly generic at times to downright tear jerking. Gameplay - From a gameplay perspective The Witcher 3 uses a very well fleshed out system of combat, magic, and dialogue to let the player cultivate their own unique experience within Geralt's story. The combat ranges from button mashy when fighting crowds, to creative and visceral when facing boss and monster with out ever feeling grindy or unsatisfying. Geralt controls well and depending on your temperament can be quite suave and even hilarious at times. There are plethora of system available in the game as well which help to supplement the overall experience. Except Gwent... I hate Gwent. Crafting and forging not only give you stronger equipment but potions and charms which can give you advantages against the men and monsters of this world. Story - The story ranges from basic rpg go here do x formula to down right engage story lines for even some of the small quests. I often found myself compelled to complete quest with stale gameplay just to see the story outcome they would have, and I'm happy to say most are worth doing! While the main story line grows stale from time to time side quests do a great job of keeping you engaged with the game enough that it never feels like a slough or choir to complete. Although it is probably best to take your time with this one, and make sure to buy the GOTY edition for the DLCs. Probably the most fun I've had with an RPG since Mass Effect and Fallout New Vegas, The Witcher 3 strikes a cord deep with anyone looking to lose themselves and many hour of their time in it wonderous and brutal world!

chen122114,"该作之所以被封神,主要是因为其认真写故事的态度——不管是主线还是支线亦或是地图上的一个问号,都可能有一段荡气回肠的精彩故事。但本作的主线剧情其实并没有多么精彩,就像《美国末日》那样,胜叙事方式以及整个巫师世界的氛围塑造及背景把控。 但该作还是有很多缺点的,地图上数不清的问号（尤其是群岛,简直噩梦）,僵硬的战斗系统和打击感,劝退的新手指引,落后的npc模式,都有可能让你错过这部作品。 但总之还是推荐每一位喜欢ARPG的玩家人手年度版,毕竟是真的便宜,万一喜欢上了,那你获得的,将是整个世界。 5.25改五星 这个游戏真的是越回味,滋味越浓厚,一定会回来二周目的。",9,2022-01-22,PC,user

Odal,"The Witcher 3 is a legendary game in the genre of RPG:s. One of the best RPG:s ever made. While it's quite linear, I think most good RPG:s tend to be. Because that's the way you build a memorable story. What makes the game so good is it's narrative driven gameplay, combined with amazing aesthetics, music, characters and setting of the game. You really feel like you are in a European Slavic- folktale. The combat is fun, the graphics (for it's time) looked amazing and every side quest is an adventure. It's not made for children - in that it doesn't shun away from grittyness, nude, and adult topics and that makes the game feel very real in a good way. The music is one of the best soundtracks to a game ever - period. It's the way it fits so perfectly with the setting while also being melodically driven. + Characters Story Environments Aesthetics The Beauty Grittyness Combat MUSIC Lenght No political agendas being pushed down your throat - A bit linear Lacks open world gameplay",9,2022-01-17,PC,user
GoldenKeys,"Don't get me wrong, i'm not here to hate, but i have to honest. In my opinion Witcher 3 is extremely boring game. Like, very, very boring. Endless emotionless dialogue, pretty basic RPG open world and overall just nothing in this game motivated me to keep going, to get to the next quest, to meet next character, nothing. It was just so boring. I wish there was some interesting end-goal or anything that keeps you motivated while you do these basic quests, but there aren't. I have always been fighting against Nudity censorship in movies and video games, so that was nice that they had it, but that's not enough to have good game. Graphics are decent by 2015 standards, but everything else is just meh.",2,2022-01-15,PC,user

Bochenki,"Do not get me wrong - it is a very good game. Incredible story, great characters, it is like a TV Show, but better. My problem is that I actually enjoy the story more than the gameplay itself. Maybe it's because I don't have experience with complicated, RPG mechanics, tons of items you can take with you, potions and spells. I am probably the weird one, but I would enjoy the game more as a simple point-and-click as it is just confusing to me.",7,2022-01-13,PC,user

OmerKaya,"Music and story is almost perfect and graphics are well done for 2015 but anything else is questionable like game play and other mechanics. You can basically rob anyone and they don't mind at all. Even tho combat have few other elements, it is spamming most of the time. We are trying to find our adopted daughter which is running away from wild hunt but we have time for countless gwent games, contracts and business women if you know what I mean. I really cant complain other than these. Game almost made everything else perfect big open world dialogs with variety of options. Choices and consequences. Good story telling.",8,2022-01-11,PC,user

Game-master1,"My scores for this game Story : /10 The game has a story that has introduced me to its world. By watching the Witcher series and playing Witcher 1 and 2, you can enjoy the game more. Graphics : 10/10 The game graphics are great and there will be a graphic update for this game. Musics : /10 The music of the game is very soothing and the songs show the misery of the people of that time. Details : 10/10 The details of the game are almost natural and acceptable. I did not see any shortage in the details of the game. Game play : 10/10 The gameplay was great and in hard mode, you have to do everything to kill animals, monsters and spirits Variety : 10/10 In the variety of games, I think that gwent Cards will suffice Characterization : 10/10 The game characters are made as if you live in that time.

LiedVogel,"Open World RPG, the choices you make follow you later so think wisely . Good narrative which **** you in and makes you feel a part of. So much to cover and side quests galore. Has a Skyrim and Dragon Age feel but more realistic in the outcomes of choices made and the encounters you stumble on at random, which is bueno. Atmosphere and music is awesome. I could not find anything that was not enjoyable about this and always find myself picking it back up. You can tell a lot of thought was put into here and this was worth every damn penny, hands down very awesome play.",10,2022-01-03,PC,user

BroTheHomes,"The Witcher 3 was a game I went into not really expecting to be blown away by, I've never been good at or a fan of souls-like combat (even though it isnt really souls-like), and I often prefer PLAYING more open games that allow you to do whatever you want (like a Skyrim). But I was absolutely blown away by the quality of the story and world around you, the limitless side quests there are to do, the great characters, how you can customize the way you play, the great DLC's, how your choices in game do matter in a way that doesn't directly tell you every time that the decision you just made mattered. A game like this keeps you on your toes and ready for the next quest or next plot point. It really progresses well too, from the starting town to the end of the game, everything seems to just flow together perfectly, balancing spending a long time at one point, but not too long, to leaving more that you can explore in places you haven't been too. There are several things you can just completely miss in this game without exploration and while it wont vastly affect your story, it does indeed have some impact. Everything about this game is superb and I'm a **** for games with good story and an even bigger **** for a game where your decisions matter. This is without a shadow of doubt a must play for anybody that gamer than owns a device that can run it.",10,2022-01-02,PC,user

SaintLaZboy,This is my favorite game I've played and I've played a LOT of games. The game never gets boring over the 90 hours of gameplay that I have played which were all a blast. Over all I say its the best RPG to date. Cyberpunk 2077 was a disaster for GOG so they are making a remastered version for Witcher to makeup for the Cyberpunks console versions. the remaster edition scheduled to release sometime in 2022. The games combat system was very good and the story is my favorite story of the RPGs I've played. Witcher 3 also has the most bad ass protagonist in any game I've played. I play on a PC with a GTX 970 on ULTRA at 1080p res and hit 60-70 frames per second. The Witcher 3 also contains my favorite DLCs I've played [Hearts of stone & Blood and Wine]. In conclusion this is my favorite and best game I have played.,10,2021-12-28,PC,user

ARSM,"The main issue for me is that there is no Role-Playing Game, because we have no role, but being the same Witcher. The only real change is how many allies you have in the end. But you can't build-up your own story and character, not even close. Also, the team promised to deliver the world, that is believable (quote: if you kill wolves, other animals will replace them in the area). But these far cry promises aren't in the game, so it feels static and becomes dead, if you trying to complete all quests on the map. The fighting system is very innertia-based, so you need to roll and dodge all the time, rather than just hit in proper timings. Characters are medieval and very unpleasant, there is no one you can really like, adore or care about, not even close. DLCs are great though: smaller areas, deeper stories, etc.",2,2021-11-18,PC,user

SDaV24,"12/10. Лучшая игра мире. Сюжет:Очень интересная история которая затронет вас до глубины души. Сюжетные дополнения это просто шедевр, исскуство особенно Кровь и Вино . Геймплей: Довольно понятный и интуитивный.На высоких сложностях играть комфортно и используюються все аспекты игры. Графика:Просто шедевральная для открытого мира.В 2015 как и сейчас это смотрится афигенно. CD Project Red смогли показать очень проработанный мир. Атмосфера: Велен с его болотами просто шикарен и передает всю напряжееность войны. Новиград прекраснейший город выполненый в европейском стиле, когда ходиш по не му то получаеш сплошное удовольствие. Что касаеться Туссента, то здесь слова излишни это просто самая атмосферная локация во всех играх в которые я играл. Персонажи: Проработаны не только главные герои но и НПС в второстепенных квестах. Одним из таках является Кровавый Барон, боже это легенданый чел.Это просто именно тот персонаж историю которого все кто поиграл в эту игру запомнят на всю жизнь. Концовки: Все концовки хорошие по своему. Особенно та где Геральт остается без Цири. Просто берет за душу. Вариативность действий:Да єто РПГ , но не классическая в понимании того кем ты хочеш стать. Здесь не так, здесь ты отыгрываеш роль заранее прописанного героя котого раскрывали на протяжении большого количества времени. И хотя ты играеш за заранее прописаного героя, то как ты будеш влиять на этот мир зависит от тебя.

UncleEd,"I had enjoyed the original Witcher, but disliked the second game for its poor gameplay. As much as Witcher 3 generally follows the Witcher 2 formula, it is a big step up from it. Again, the gameplay is passable at best, but the more accessible open world design and removal of QTEs really help it. Movement is a bit clunky and combat is really nothing special. Yes, you can prepare potions, use signs, enchant your weapons etc. but it won’t take you long to figure out that repeatedly dodging and hitting will get you through the entire game. As a game adapted from fantasy novel series, you won’t be surprised to find great lore here, similar to previous games. There is a good variety of monsters and many encounters feel unique. Where the Witcher 3 shines though, are the cutscenes. They are very well made and watching the cutscenes (you will watch them very often) will feel like watching a pretty good fantasy themed tv show. Character development for all the characters including the insignificant side characters is very good. Overall, the game suffers from the same burnout that most open world games do. You have a map filled with question marks and generic fetch quests. Some of the best quests are secondary quests, whereas some of the worst fetch quests are within the main questline. So, you will never know what quests are worth doing and which ones you should skip, which results in completing pretty much every quest you get, which then causes burnout. Save some exceptions, I often felt like in one of the MMORPGs released in early 2000s where the game felt like homework. On the other hand, completing my homework was often rewarded with a great cutscene, which was a joy to watch. 8.5/10",9,2021-10-12,PC,user

Kelen,"9/10 ️ - Amazing (after 256 hours of playing & completing the game twice) Great game, great characters, great stories! The tasks are amazing and it is a pleasure to travel the world. I went through several times to see different endings. Each of them is very rewarding. The main storyline is good, but sometimes it's too slow. The feeling that you are still a few steps behind and that everyone else knows more is a bit tiring. Great views, good graphics, and all this is accompanied by well-matched music",9,2021-10-09,PC,user

Bushido95,"Я краб... э... кхм, крайне доволен. По сей день в игре отличная графика и не потому что она какая-то невероятная или это второе пришествие ""Crysis"", а потому что это довольно эстетично смотрится, что как мне кажется очень важно в каждой игре из-за той же эстетичности первый ведьмак по сей день графически вполне очаровательный. В DLC Кровь и Вино я даже перестал пользоваться быстрым перемещением чтоб просто наслаждаться видами как можно дольше. Геймплей увлекательный можно потеряться во времени изучая мир. Большая часть второстепенных квестов в игре на высоком уровне и ничем не уступают основным, а где-то превосходят. Многие жалуются на боевую систему, но плохой её назвать трудно как по мне она приятная без заморочек и даже чувствуются удары чего не скажешь о второй части ведьмака, но это уже другая история. Тебя не заставляют зачищать всю карту ты можешь проходить игру так как тебе этого хочется да есть сайд квесты которые можно провалить в случае неверного порядка прохождения, но последовательность интуитивно понятна. Снова упомяну DLC Кровь и Вино потому что именно там в Туссенте находится приятнее всего я получил больше всего положительных эмоции именно там. Не рекомендую ничего скипать и это также относится ко всем письмам, книгам, заметкам что представлены в игре потому что это помогает в погружении и дает ответы хоть и обрывками на некоторые интересные вопросы, что возникают по ходу игры. Атмосфера темного фэнтези присутствует на действительно высочайшем уровне и музыки в игре довольно много и она отлично вписывается под атмосферу, локации и во время битвы, а некоторые треки уже в моем плейлисте. Из минусов я бы вкратце упомянул плотву, лодку, баги и иногда скорость озвучки чудит, но это всё так не важно и ни одному олдфагу никогда не мешало главный минус для меня опишу ниже. Как и подавляющее число геймеров я познакомился со вселенной ведьмака именно с 3 части, что вызывало много вопросов по типу кто все эти люди? что вообще тут происходит? Проблема в том, что если вы даже играли в прошлые части серии, то и там вы не получите ответов на половину возникших вопросов. Основной сюжет игры при всем желании не получается оценить выше чем средний... бесспорно есть интересные, захватывающие, забавные, трогательные моменты в процессе продвижения по сюжетной линии, но после прохождения игры я так и не понял мотива Жалкой Охоты и их диснеевского злодея Эредина. На фоне других антагонистов из двух DLC Эредин это какая-то шутка. То к чему мы приходит к концу игры вызывает недоумение я даже удивился, что игра внезапно закончилась на этом моменте. Учитывая всё это и невероятно качественные DLC я всё таки остался очень доволен и получил море удовольствия. Это и правда одна из лучших игр всех времен.",10,2021-09-27,PC,user

DeniMars,"Не понимаю такого повального восторга от этой игры. Она плоха во всем, от кривого неудобного управления, до псевдо-искусственного открытого мира. На начальной локации ставить врагов с черепом на голове, которые убивают с 1-2 ударов, игрока, который только-только учится играть и привыкает к неудобному корявому управлению, это верх некомпетентности разработчиков. Смысл тогда от открытости мира, если меня насильно толкают по сюжету, а на всех значках вопросов отвешивают завышенные по уровню враги. Ну либо там просто копипаста места силы да гнезда. Нет смысла исследовать локации. Идти строго по сюжету и все, ну и делайте тогда коридорную, сюжетно-ориентированную игру. Дерганная камера, от которой голова кружиться начинает, особенно когда ГГ лезет по лестнице. Максимально убогая однообразная боевка. Ни стелса, ни каких то различий в оружии. Все сводится к маханию мечом и вечным перекатам. Даже знаки и те неудобно использовать. Через меню. В том же Ассассине умения (считай знаки) и то проще и продуманней реализованы. Вне боя Геральт за все цепляется, поворачивается как танк на месте, вечно куда то несется и упирается во все подряд. Играть невозможно. 80% всего геймплея это кат-сцены, от которых через время уже начинаешь уставать и тянет зевать. Инвентарь настолько запутанный, что черт ногу сломит. За что ей завышают так оценки, мне не понятно. Она плоха вообще во всем. Глупые НПС, которые тебя вечно толкают и в тебя врезаются, а спутники прижимаются к тебе и трутся об тебя, мешаясь постоянно. Да и НПС пустые болванки, декорации с одинаковыми лицами, которые по сути не несут никакой пользы в игре, только создают помехи. Мини карта с мелкими значками на которой ничерта не видно. Переоцененная игра. Единственно, за что можно накинуть баллы, так только за музыку и неплохие пейзажи ну и может быть сами квесты и их повествование.",6,2021-09-17,PC,user

Stamacho,"The sheer pleasure and bafflement you experience after playing this game are unexplainable. I don't know any other game that has done everything right except The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. The first time when you ride with Vesemir in the glamorous sunsets of White Orchard, The foggy swamps of Velen, snowy landscapes of Skellige, the beggers and crowded streets of Novigrad, The magnificent castle of Kaer Morhen and accompanied by one of the best video game soundtracks ever created are only one of the few reasons to revisit this game even today. All of the big areas are filled with detailed locations that you might even miss after your 10th playthrough. The side quests are one of the essential parts of the game in which there are no repeating elements and each one are unique and a joy to experience. There are tons of memorable characters and quests that will stick to your mind for the rest of your life.

Dnische,"Easy one of the best games i've ever played. Not flawless but still iconic. Story ( the strongest part of Witcher 3 ) is so awesome, i can barely name games with narration and dialogs that good. Especially i'd like to point out the postmodern component of it, screenwriters perfectly conveyed the ideas and concepts laid down in the books. Gameplay itself sometimes may seem repetitive, due to scope of the content (all these endless question marks on Skellige) but most of it is optional. At the same time the main quest provides very intense and lush adventure, full of memorable moments and characters. Can't find reasons to hate it . 9/10 by far",9,2021-08-29,PC,user

Surma,"I think the game has gotten a little bit overhyped (not much). After playing through Cyberpunk 2077, I wanted to check out what this game was about, and I am able to recognize so many features that Cyberpunk 2077 got supposedly trashed for. Someone said in Cyberpunk 98% of dialogues don't lead to different outcome. Well that's kinda same for Witcher 3 as well. Just like in Cyberpunk 2077 you're mostly just able to get more information about the quest itself and surrounding areas. Maybe that style of RPG is more suitable for fantasy game where it's more interesting to have talks about fantasy creatures invading your areas than some gang members. Another thing was that the leveling system felt kinda boring and there's not really much there to maintain my interest in the game. The quests however and the atmosphere of vast open fields and well crafted dialogues is what is keeping me interested the game. I think there's just too many menu tips being shoved at you the same time when you first start the game, especially crafting system. I think for content, this game is 10/10 masterpiece, but for gameplay mechanics, I think this is around 8 category, and sure, maybe too mechanical game would ruin some of the fun in this type of game.",9,2021-08-04,PC,user

They probably feel personally attacked if someone appreciates an actually thoroughly good game, such as The Witcher 3, over their only-excellent-when-modded-favourite game Skyrim.

Reviewer102,"The game deserves the attention for the vast open world that the game offers you to explore . The story is written well and characters are well fleshed out . The graphics are great and soundtrack is immersive . There are so many ways to praise this game . But enough of that as I'm sure you can find more of that by other reviewers . This game by definition is still 'overated.' People are too scared to vocalize that this game has its issues in fear of being downvoted or attacked by fans of this game series . Truth is , the combat is lacking . You dodge back and strike . You do this again and again . Combat becomes boring and a chore . The story as described above is well written no doubt but it lacks in good pacing . The story fails in pacing as you are bombarded with story after story without having time to digest the stories . It makes the stories unmemorable . The story starts off very strong as it hypes you up for an epic journey to find Ciri . But it just dissolves into nothing but unnecessarily long talks . Yes , the talking in this game is long but the talks aren't very interesting . That is the problem . Not going to sugar coat it . Romance in the game is for horny men and is cheap perfume . Not like that is 'bad,' but it somewhat gets old after a while . It is like real life marriage almost . Pretty accurate as some may say . The villains in Witcher 3 is terribly cliché . They are the stereotypical bad guys with bulky armor . They aren't that interesting as a whole . There are some villans that are intriguing no doubt though . They are so forgettable in general . Yes this game is based on a series of books written by Andrzej Sapkowski so CDPR can't do much about the villans other than change the way they are visually portrayed in the game . Witcher 3 should have not won GOTY . Games like MGSV should have won as MGSV actually had an epic story and amazing gameplay . Though MGSV comes with its flaws it still does the job better at least in gameplay where Witcher 3 lacks heavily . The game is overated and overhyped beyond understand but it indeed deserves the attention but only a fraction of it . This is why this review is a mixed score .",7,2021-06-30,PC,user

gwynbleidd27,This is the best gaming experience ever and I don't think I will ever enjoy a game this much. I loved medieval games and directly picked the witcher 3 after I saw so many people love it. Played about 8 hours then uninstalled it because I was a dumbass and didn't know how to read the book keira gives you so I was stuck and couldn't continue the main quets (I WAS DUMB I know) after some time I tried it again and from that day I have played it for about 800 hours with more than 6 playthroughs this game is just a masterpiece. the soundtrack the characters the main quests the side quests the world the atmosphere are all just perfect. I will never forget when I first got to Skellige which was a whole new region with its own people and tradition and the beautiful environment and the soundtrack that made me just walk around.

ashwathama199,"When I first played Witcher 3, I absolutely had no idea about it. I thought of it as a Graphic Marvel, Purchased a 960 GTX in order to play it, and was blown by the graphics. But that was it, the game never interested me except for its last missions, couldn't get even a single bit of the story. Didnt even realise I did the bad ending, never touched the DLC, uninstalled the game, considered it average, and called it a day. After 4 years, decided to pick it up again, thanx to Steam which offered Tremendous discounts on these games. I first explored The story of Witcher 1, played Witcher 2 along with all side quests, found it good, Then started Witcher 3, did research about good ending, and finished almost every side quest and Question Mark. And I am happy to tell..... my opinion about this Franchise has completely changed. Witcher 3 is one of the best games ever created, which puts forward an Amazing Game of Thrones like politics on one side, and a heartwarming Journey of a Witcher- Geralt of Rivia, on the other. The unique thing about this game is the neutral nature of the protagonist, the game allows you to make choices and decide on his behalf not only in Main Quests but also in almost 3/4ths of a hundreds of non-repititive Side Quests this game has to offer, Witcher 3 perfectly demonstrates the feeling of being a contract monster killer despised by the society for its heartless nature ( which it might not be ). This is supplemented by beautiful soundtrack comprising of Folk music which adds charm to almost every kind of scene, be it a fight, romance, celebrations or some tragedy. The well developed characters, the complex chemistry between Geralt, Yennefer and Triss, and the love of Geralt for Ciri ( whom he considers his daughter ) makes it one of the most memorable games ever witnessed. The combat system manages to avoid monotony unlike most of the other RPGs where over repititive combat has always been an atrocious feature. It still astonishes me how this massive game manages to have 76 unique endings, I think no other game has ever pulled it off. Besides for some of its horrible glitches and optimisation issues, CD Projekt Red has done a tremendous Job in creating this Flawless Masterpiece, hats off from my side. Can't wait to continue with the DLC which adds almost 50 hrs of content to a game which is already very long. I think it is never late to start exploring its beauty, since this work is beyond its time. I RATE IT 9.7/10",10,2021-06-16,PC,user

Matrix4333,"Good game story-wise, but gameplay is actual garbage. I completed every single quest in starting location and still only level 3. Can't do anything in next location, Vizima is supposed to be for level 5, but 2nd quest already level 9 enemies, which I can't kill... I use counter like potions and right sword... I improved everything I could, but I had barely 300 crowns at that point... Played on 3/4 difficulty and it is not like I Am not new to RPG either. It is AC bs design and grind fest, side quests mostly uninteresting... Combat system: - only items matters skill is irrelevant - when you attack at the same time, you get damage and you can't parry... - parry gets you stunned useless - you can evade attacks, but again if you attack at the same time there is nothing you can do and you get damage for free Also some enemies don't show in bestiary...",5,2021-06-03,PC,user

Tryve,"I don't know why I couldn't get into this game. I tried countless times to see the epic greatness of the game from effusive praise and glowing reviews all over the place. Not to say that it is a bad game, just doesn't feel as perfect as ppl make it to be. The open world is in the UbiSoft school of Design, filled with world breaking jank that could srsly ruin some1's immersion. Its like they tried to mix AC and Skyrim in moderate doses, but still failed to find a great balance. Combat feels like its out of a 2005 game. There's still that horse running into a wall thingy there. Really bad. The story is pretty good though, with some really well written side quests. This is mainly what stands out for the game. There are a ton of quests to undertake and delve deeper into the lore of the world. This is mainly where the game shines. Maybe its just that I played RDR2 b4 this, character movement here feels clunky and unnatural and horse riding here is terrible compared to it. If I played this b4 rdr2 I would probably be acclaiming it like everyone else. My overall score would be arnd 5.5, but since meta doesn't do half reviews 6'll HV to do.",6,2021-05-28,PC,user

praXismaXimus,"An obvious pastiche of Assassin's Creed, Skyrim, and the Far Cry games - and is reaching to achieve the quality of any of them. Basic mechanics are lacking - character movement is like a tugboat piloted by a drunk, the levelling and inventory systems are incredibly half-assed, and enemy levels are literally all over the map. The story is bombastic open-ended and hole-ridden nonsense - even as a fantasy title - but has loads of sex and cynicism mixed in which impresses people, I guess? If you're thinking this game is going to be a big step up from Witcher 2, you're going to be disappointed. Much of the amateurish jank is still here. Many of the cinematic cutscenes are impressive, really nice music, and some solid sidequests with good variety, but this is really just a 6/10 game with high-ish production values.",7,2021-05-24,PC,user

wokenoodle,"Witcher 3 is often praised for it's plot and how player choice impacts it, yet I don't feel like this praise is earned. It has mostly good dialog, interesting and charismatic characters (both leads and minor ones), somewhat effective set-pieces, but the story itself (except for the Velen chapter, which is the only one everyone tends to bring up) is kinda lacklustre. As soon as you get to Novigrad, plot treads start abruptly appearing only to lead pretty much nowhere and leave no real consequence (witch hunts, Radovid, gangs), pacing is off and characters start to crack up with small inconsistencies (mainly, Dandelion). These issues will be alleviated with Skellige's focused side plot and soft mental reset granted by the new map, but after Battle at Kaer Morhen they kick back in like an obstinate mule with a newfound force of rushing to conclude broad plot threads that shouldn't've been there in the first place. Sprinkled with some awful resolutions of essential story arks (Dijkstra, Avallac'h) and absolutely pathetic main villain - you got a really, really mixed bag of a plot, which is mostly remembered well for the Velen chapter everyone was so blow away by. My other criticisms of Witcher 3 are much less controversial: combat is too basic for such a long game, character progression inclines to highly specialise in a few from already not that many options, and enemies rarely require you to step out of that chosen specialisation. Loot system is garbage (literally). Alchemy is a double edged sword: I really appreciate that consumables replenish (it's one of the best design choices in the game), but being able to pop a decoctions whenever you want really takes away from the planning gameplay, while knowing his enemy and preparing accordingly should be one of the key witcher's abilities. And the worst offender is the dumbed down, streamlined and formulaic, almost automatic in nature gameplay loop that became pure torture towards last ten ours of my playthrough. Witcher Sense is one of the most overused and non-engaging mechanics I've ever encountered in a videogame. None of what I just said renders the game unplayable or even not fun, it's just really uninspired, mediocre and lacks coherent brave vision. The real beauty of Witcher 3, what I consider the reason people fell in love with this game, the strength of CDPR that came to be the highlight even in the disastrous Cyberpunk 2077, is the world and atmosphere. Novigrad is the best videogame city I've ever been to, you won't find more lifelike countryside than White Orchard, everything in this game looks stylish, feels evocative, sounds enthralling and plays damn immersively, even with all the grudges I hold agains it. I might not had the best gaming experience, but it was a great time - time, spent as Geralt of Rivia in wondrous, magical and dangerous lands. To sum it all up, Witcher 3 is a mediocre open world action RPG, that stole the industry spotlight for all the wrong reasons, but you won't regret loosing yourself in it for a hundred hours.",7,2021-05-06,PC,user

Mpbpl,"Sidenote: DLC has Giant Spiders! For those who suffer from Arachnophobia there is a mod on the internet. What can be told about this game that has not been said? This game created a netflix series, and put the work of Andrzej Sapkowski together with Lord Of The Rings as the biggest fantasy series worldwide, and it is easy to understand why! This is CD Project Red Magnum Opus, the graphics are astounding, the setpieces are amazing, the world feels alive, all the cities, residents, farmers, monsters, everything seems to be there for a reason and because of it the immersion on this world is instant. The characters are timeless, even those that you might not like have a backstory that makes you understand them at least. The side characters? they have the same treatment! The villains? they have the same too! Nothing and no one was created in this game just to be there! The voice acting is spot on! I can hear their voices even when I read the books. The story is really intriguing and if never played a witcher game, saw the series or read the books, it don't matter, they give enough information to make you not feel lost and at the same time not too much to feel overwhelmed.

It's so obvious why this game is actually famous and that's female nudity and this game has tons of it. I have absolutely nothing against female nudity in video games, but if that's your main selling point, then it becomes a problem. It's the exact same reason why Cyberpunk sold over 13 million copies. They said game has naked females and automatically every nerd ever pre-ordered it. It's almost pathetic how easy it is to sell your game. Just put naked females into it and it can be emptiest, most buggy game possible, but it had female nudity and sells over 13 million regardless. That's why games are dying, thanks to companies like CDproject. They over promote their games with sex and nudity, while actual game/gameplay is extremely outdated.",0,2021-04-21,PC,user
AltumSilentium,"Достойная Action RPG, полагаю понравится всем любителям жанра и в особенности фанатам книжной саги. CDPR RED очень умело продолжают с небольшими коррективами историю книг, увлекая игрока в историю. Остаться равнодушным к судьбам персонажей почти невозможно. Таким образом, сюжет, персонажи, диалоги возносят эту игру над многими другими проектами. В тоже время боевая система и развитие персонажа довольно таки ""ограничены"". Безусловно это оправдывается с лорной стороны, но разнообразия билдов вы тут не найдёте, а боевка не сможет удивить.

Vegito901,"Ok now I got to be honest in this one. At first I felt At the beginning I felt that the game was too overwhelming, too big and too adult for me because I came from Skyrim, and to make a comparison was impossible because they were the ''two greats'' of the genre. I watched an advice video about the game. When I came back I was excited, and when I left White Orchard.... 210 hours are the number of hours I have played. I've played the main campaign 2 times and I'm waiting for the next-gen update to play the DLC's again. The world of The Witcher 3, the Continent, is plagued with evilness, hunger, suffering, sadness and war, that's what you see, and the folklore and richness of the world will make all this stuff charming. Thanks to the huge amount of different and side quests, enemies, how the world reacts to you and your decisions (nothing to do with Skyrim by the way), the beauty of the game itself, the characters, the story, even the gameplay, everything! This game will catch you, and when you finish it you will realize that you played the best game ever. And that if you used your time for something worthwhile. 5000 characters are too few to be able to express all the love and respect I have for this game, all the affection I have acquired for the characters and how I enjoyed the main campaign. But maybe they are enough to talk about the DLC's. Hearts of Stone is fantastic and introduces you to one of the best villains of the saga of video games, I do not want to detail more because although it is worthwhile, what I want to talk more than anything is the second DLC. And even so, it's a sin not to buy the whole game. Blood and Wine... Imagine a place where you gather the most beautiful of French, Italian and Spanish culture. That beautiful music, those colors, that attitude of the inhabitants of Toussaint... after wars and suffering, after death, you arrive in a world full of life, wealth, abundance and nobility. Someone who has a strong European identity would cry from happiness if such a place existed. Toussaint is magnificent, and I repeat it because I measure my words, MAGNIFICENT. A year after playing the DLC I am still humming the songs, I even have them downloaded on my phone and know how to play them on instrument. I already loved The Witcher 3, it was already the best game I'd ever played in my life, and then came Toussaint.... It's a near perfect game. It's magnificent. It's wonderful.

It is a very violent game, characters seem old and depressed and full of personal issues and problems. To sum it up: Pros: 1) Graphics were good at the time the game came out. Cons: 1) A depressive and sad game 2) Too much violence without good reason 3) World is just too large 4) Fighting system is unresponsive and is hugely based on stats rather than skill. 5) Characters are very boring 6) Depressive Music...",2,2021-03-30,PC,user

Каждая минута игры в третьего Ведьмака доставляет удовольствие, да что уж тут - не всегда хочется включать игру пока не послушаешь песню ""В поле спят мотыльки"". Ну и саундтрек, конечно, создает неповторимую атмосферу, это касается как основной игры так и DLC (Больше всего запомнилась песня о Гюнтере О'Диме). Сюжет. (БЕЗ СПОЙЛЕРОВ) Что касается него тут тоже можно говорить бесконечно, опять же для фанатов вселенной именно он на первом месте. Наконец-то появляются Йен, Цири и многие другие важные пер-сы саги. Еще есть такая тема, что канон ли сюжет игр о Ведьмаке, я могу с уверенностью сказать, что для меня это канон. Да, в игре присутствуют концовки и другие выборы по ходу игры (Это же RPG), вот тут конечно можно и поспорить по поводу каноничности тех или других выборов. Но все равно даже после прохождения на одну концовку, хочется пройти на другую - вот в этом и фишка. И еще круто, что есть переносы сейвов из второй части, опять же не знакомые с вселенной думают это не сильно важно, а для фанов это формирует окружающий мир, смотря на результат принятых решений, ну и можно встретить старых друзей из 2-ой части)). И стоит упоминуть огромную, огромную кучу интересных доп. квестов и ведьмачьих заказов. DLC. Есть еще и 2 Дополнения ""Каменные сердца"", ""Кровь и вино"". В общем они офигенны и проходятся как отдельные игры. Любимая вселенная, любимая игра!",10,2021-03-28,PC,user

MurphyBrandon,"I enjoyed The Witcher 3. It's pretty good. I'll give it 8 out of 10 points. It's not flawless, though. I have five main issues with The Witcher 3: 1. The movement is not smooth. Geralt and Roach get stuck awkwardly on objects at the worst times. 2. Fast travel isn't as convenient as it could be, and I am tired of hearing the narrator repeat the same line every time I switch regions. 3. There's too much sexual objectification of women. 4. The list of achievements is not user-friendly. There are multiple achievements that have very specific requirements, and many of them can be easily missed by accident which would force a player to replay the whole game to earn all of them. Given the length of this game, that is not nice for the players. 5. When my screen is at full brightness and max gamma, I still have trouble seeing anything in the dark caves. I use the torch and can only see 3 feet in front of the character.",8,2021-03-23,PC,user
Dom007,"This is one of the best games ever made. It does everything a great RPG should do. It provides a memorable storyline with an amazing cast of characters, an amazing soundtrack and a beautiful open world. The combat whilst pretty average is more than good enough thanks to an amazing variety of enemies and bosses. It has amazing side quests with outstanding variety and on top of all this it has two of the best gaming dlc's ever made making the game even better. There is sometimes the odd glitch or bug in this game that may take away from the experience and I will point out the rather iffy lock on system and swimming controls both of which could have been improved on, but overall this game is no doubt a masterpiece. Why can't more modern video games be like this?",10,2021-03-22,PC,user

OncomingStorm12,"I have recently finished the Witcher 3 (I know, I'm late). And...I have some things to say absolutely. **** probably the best RPG game you'll ever play. There's a reason many, in fact, like, 97% of people would swear that this is the best game ever **** I agree. Some...some things, I would like to point out: 1. The combat, is not the best in the Witcher 3, but it is absolutely enjoyable as heck, once you get into it properly. Like, around the 10-12 hour mark is when the game will truly reveal to you, in terms of mechanics and gameplay. It is not the best, again, but remember that this is NOT Medieval Combat Simulator, its Witcher 3, a narrative-driven RPG. 2. ****, better to say, narrative, is insanely good. Hearts Of Stone is the best story I have ever experienced, and main story is amazing too. Some parts...sure, some parts slack off a bit but the game more than makes up for it in the subsequent parts. Act 2 and ending of Act 3 are adrenaline-rushes, whereas Act 1 and first half of Act 3 builds the tension up. 3. I've seen plenty of people claim that ""wItcHeR 3 iS noT aN rPg"", and frankly, I would say they do not know what an RPG means. RPG means that you get to role-play and build your character's personality as you like, not about getting to slaughter absolutely everybody you see on the street. In that, Witcher 3 is as much of an RPG as any other of the same genre. You can be a rude bastard, or a polite and helpful Witcher. You can even build and role-play any of **** wait, I think it was six, schools of Witchers (like me, for eg, am running a Bear School Tank build and I need to focus on strength and alchemy to role-play an Ursine Witcher...) 4. ALTHOUGH combat is not the best, there's still crazy depth to the combat system, and I could probably spend and entire small book outlining and pointing every single minute detail bout the system. All in all, don't listen to the negatives, they are mostly pointing out points that are not even supposed to be pointed out, like how the story doesn't connect to Witcher 2, blah blah blah. Most of what they say is utter nonsense. I had this same notion too that Witcher 3 was not good enough because it is famous, and such, but then I got into it and man. It is now my favorite game of all time, along with the rest of the like, 97-98% of gamers. When they say that this is the greatest game ever made, that is exactly how this game deserves to be referred to. Go ahead and buy it. You most certainly won't be disappointed.",10,2021-02-23,PC,user

samstrummer90,"¿Por qué witcher 3 no es un 10? Por como insulta a los jugadores con detalles de dejadez. En el mapa del tutorial hay un ciudadano que no encarga acabar con un fantasma y luego nos dice que es muy pobre, hasta ahí todo correcto para dejarnos las opción típica de hacer de buen samaritano, pero si después registramos su casa y le robamos en la cara, porque la propiedad privada no existe en este juego, vemos que en un saco en mitad del salón hay una esmeralda del tamaño de un puño y un glifo de magia. Y eso se repite durante todo el juego. El sistema de loot es nefasto en general. ¿Por qué no es un 9? Por el muro invisible de nivel que tiene el juego. En el tutorial somos capaces de matar grifos, sumergidos, huargos, humanos y apariciones pero poco después de haber matado un grifo del tamaño de un elefante no somos capaces de acabar con un miliciano mediocre ni con un enano de sacabuche según llegamos a la primera gran ciudad. Eso no tiene ningún sentido y arruina la inmersión. Habría sido mucho más lógico dar un nivel a cada enemigo, si un grifo es nivel 20, lo es siempre, si un miliciano es nivel 3, lo es siempre. El maestro en esto es Gothic 2 y Witcher peca de abusar del modo fácil y cutre de asignar niveles porque sí a los enemigos. El problema se ve también a la inversa cuando tenemos demasiado nivel para una misión y un gran monstruo que debería ser un desafío se convierte en una chorrada que ni siquiera nos da experiencia. Por todo lo demás. Un juego soberbio con muchísimas horas de diversión, dlc espectaculares y un apartado técnico y gráfico bastante respetable.",8,2021-02-19,PC,user
GreenSmiley14,"The best RPG I have ever played. The story and narrative are a little confusing when you first start, but as you get into it you will start to understand more and more. Graphics are stunning, even to this day with foliage rendering unlike anything I've ever seen. The combat is simple, but addictive and gets the job done. The movement can feel clunky at time, but that is easy to ignore because the rest of the game is so good. Your choices influence the story in major ways, and a lot of rpg games say this but end up not doing much (Cyberpunk 2077). But choices you make even right in the beginning of the game, have consequences, making this one of the most immersive games I have played. Truly stunning what CD Projekt Red managed to pull off and definitely worth a buy in 2021.",9,2021-02-18,PC,user
VogelFubar,"A lot will find this comment annoying and will find it not helpful, but to be honest, the game is waaaay too overhyped. Nothing is so special about it, even the dialogue mechanism. We have found that also in Mass Effect and Skyrim. The world of Witcher is very normal, nothing so special whether with the Atmosphere or the Landscape. I have played it until the last mission, and the fact is, i couldn't play it anymore and lost my appetite of going forward. I uninstalled it and never get back to it again. To be so overhyped about a game is not a bad thing, but too much of a thing can be harmful, just like drinking Alcohol. sorry, but I'd rather buy WinRar.",2,2021-02-17,PC,user

Gryzorz,"It took me several attemps at this game to get hooked. I initially thought ""moving feels choppy, combat system is different from what I'm used to"". I was also afraid of the grinding phase. Even though I was not impressed with the main story, once I finished it, I eventually proceeded to play to ""Hearts of Stone"", and slowly began to discover the real narrative genius. At the same time, I had also perfected a light armor built I really enjoyed. After finihing this awesome extension, I was now eager to jump into ""Blood and Wine"", and I took another punch in the face. Maybe it's because I'm getting older, but I grew more and more impressed with the writing/filming/acting of all of it. I'm an old gamer, I've played many games to the point of being unimpressed most of the time (that's what happened at the beginning I think and why I had trouble getting hooked), but this game is going to give me a long-lasting impression.

Tyson14,"The game has a huge content which gives you many hours of play and I consider that the game should not be considered as RPG, it should be considered as an open world adventure: -The best feature of the game and for what it is widely recognized is for the large number of missions it has and of which many have very interesting stories, in addition to the enormous amount of dialogues and cinematics and the possibility of deciding on various missions, Some with low impact and others that impact other missions in the future or even in the history and lore of our campaign, so I consider that the extremely positive criticisms of the game are justified and it is already among my favorite games. -It has a system of ""talents"" to specialize in various styles of combat, in addition to alchemy and crafts to create armor, weapons and potions -Has a lot of enemies and monsters -The extension of the map is quite large and the setting is incredible with variable landscapes and different villages, towns and even a complete city full of citizens -It has a card game that I really liked where you have to play with different innkeepers, vendors and game characters to improve your deck of cards Bad features: -The combat is simple to be an adventure game and the AI of the enemies is also simple and you can avoid combats only with ease just by running a little but it is compensating with the large number and variety of enemies that there are in addition to customization of the statistics and combat of our character but it is compensating with the large number of enemies -Without counting the missions of the game, basically there is no open world, the NPCS throughout the towns and cities do not do anything except for some that have some routine, they cannot even be attacked and the guards are decorative, so without missions there is nothing to do -This filling of cinematics that are not cinematics properly, if not dialogues with changes of lights and cameras, sometimes becomes tedious and time consuming",10,2021-02-13,PC,user

mrPinx,"Игра в целом неплоха, однако главный минус это отношение разработчиков к старым игрокам. На пк есть возможность загрузки старых сохранений в последущие версии игры. Т.е прошел первую часть загрузил во вторую, далее в третью. Сюжет первой части и геймплей для тех времен был очень крут. Я проходил Ведьмака 1 много раз и каждый раз было круто. Когда вышел Ведьмак 2, перенос вещей и упоминание об Адда было неплохим решением, потому что весь Ведьмак 2 это попытка вспомнить прошлое плюс политические предпосылки. И вот мы добираемся до Ведьмака 3. Есть изменения затрагивающие персонажей, однако проходя игру за Нильфгаард , совершенно непонятно куда делась Адда? И когда упоминают, что Темерия стала вассальным государством, почему не говорят об Анаис, дочери Фольтеста. Что с ней? Сам Эмгыр или Радовид убили её что-ли? Есть возможность встретить старых персонажей. Впринципе все нелохо однако вы выпускаете 2 ДЛС ""Каменные сердца"" и ""Кровь и вино"". Т.е. Ведьмак 1 я проходил выбирая шани, Геральт сам много раз говорил, что ненавидит магию и порталы, и как бы логично, что Шани лучший вариант. Шани в свою очередь утверждает, что не может быть с Геральтом по причине, что он ведьмак и постоянно не дома. Но блять! В диалоге с Трисс есть возможность сказать, что ведьмаку все надоело и он просто хочет жить как обычно. Почему перед выпуском ""Кровь и вино"" нельзя было добавить такую же функцию для Шани. Т.е. с Трисс он может жить, а с Шани нет? ОМГ! Проходя все части игры, я надеялся на тот финал, который хотел. Но разработчики сами решают как правильно и все равно на игроков. Графика, боевая система и прочее пойдет. The game is generally not bad, but the main disadvantage is the attitude of the developers towards old players. On the pc, it is possible to load old saves into future versions of the game. Ie I went through the first part and loaded it into the second, then into the third. The plot of the first part and the gameplay for those times was very cool. I've done The Witcher 1 many times and every time it was cool. When The Witcher 2 came out, transferring things and mentioning Add was not a bad decision, because the whole Witcher 2 is an attempt to remember the past plus political background. And now we get to The Witcher 3. There are changes affecting the characters, but passing the game for Nilfgaard, it is completely incomprehensible where Adda went? And when they mention that Temeria has become a vassal state, why don't they talk about Anais, the daughter of Foltest. What with her? Did Emhyr himself or Radovid kill her or what? There is an opportunity to meet old characters. In principle, everything is not good, however you release 2 DLS ""Stone Hearts"" and ""Blood and Wine"". Those. The Witcher 1 I went through choosing Shani, Geralt himself said many times that he hates magic and portals, and it seems logical that Shani is the best option. Shani, in turn, claims that he cannot be with Geralt for the reason that he is a witcher and is constantly not at home. But **** In dialogue with Triss, there is an opportunity to say that the witcher is tired of everything and he just wants to live as usual. Why was it impossible to add the same function for Shani before the release of ""Blood and Wine"". Those. he can live with Triss, but not with Shani? OMG! Going through all parts of the game, I hoped for the ending that I wanted. But the developers decide for themselves how to do it correctly and all the same to the players. Graphics, combat system and stuff will go.",7,2021-01-30,PC,user

Dzhani,"The Witcher 3 is a great example **** with amazingly executed aspects of the game. Open world: The world in the third part of Witcher is huge, especially with the DLC’s. It has a big variety of landscapes with their specifics. You can find yourself on Skellige islands as in the duchy of Toussaint. Every part of the world has something to entertain you with. You can find something regulair as a monster nest to a big and interesting side quest (clearing out the monster nests is not that bad as it may sound btw). Gameplay: All the fights are interesting to have and as you are upgrading they will get more variable. The upgrade system is good structured. From the very beginning of the game you will have to chose which signs, battle style, etc. you want to use. As you come to the end of the main storyline, you will then already be able to have very different parts of skills upgraded. The game can be very difficult if you want it to be it. But if you are only interested in the story’s, then you can change it to the storyline difficulty. Story’s: Those are great in the Witcher 3. All of them. As in the main story as in the side quests. For example of a side quest, you will be overthrowing the king and investigating the attack on the feast. Oh and don’t forget about the main DLC’s story’s, they are great, as great or almost on the same level as the main storyline for sure. Extra: There are a few more interesting activity’s such as horse racing or fist fight or gwent (a card game in the Witcher’s world). I know that not all of you find reading as interesting as the activity’s listed above, but reading in this game will learn you more about the world of Witcher. There is also the bestiary where you can read new information about the creatures and the persons you have met earlier. As concluding I will give this game the 10/10, it is my favourite one!",10,2021-01-07,PC,user

Zailer,"A gorgeous quest design bogged down by the dated gameplay. The quests of the Witcher 3, be it the main story or side quests or DLC quests, are arguably the best quests in the RPGs ever. Gameplay and melee, however, are so bad it feels like they were taken straight from Gothic or Gothic 3 - super-clunky animations, dumb and uncomfortable melee mechanics, and the worst of it all, these stupid red barells what were probably taken straight from GTA San Andreas and explode unexpectedly in the heat of the fight. Although I rate it as 8, I'm hardly dissapointed - this 82 million dollars game being compared to Red Dead Redemption 2 and nominated as game of the decade drags unrealistic expectations from me. It's not even top 10 of 2010's for me.",8,2021-01-06,PC,user
Sanciny,"This game has a strong place in my heart although it is not perfect game. Here's why. + story + characters + romance + dialogue choices that have impact on whole story + immersive world of witchers and monsters + graphics in general + soundtrack + many options how to upgrade your characters (different builds for signs, sword play and so on) + huge amount of equipment (swords, armor sets, decoctions...) + huge amount of other items (food, books, letters...) + quality DLCs + a lot of very well done and unique monsters + interesting side quests + not only one possible end of the story + you may want to play it again (with different build or story choices) + tons of downloadable mods - some animations (in cutscenes for example) - very unrealistic and strange wind behaviour (can be fixed by mod) - repetitive faces - swordplay from horse - not very smart NPCs - game save logic sometimes (it saves your game before dialogue, after which there is a boss fight. So if you get killed, you need to get through whole dialogue again.)",10,2021-01-06,PC,user

awagam34,"10/10 ŚWIAT Świat w Wiedźminie 3 jest przedstawiony świetnie, jak nie najlepiej w całej serii. Jedynie pierwsza odsłona podejmuje walkę. Mrok, masa odcieni szarości w pomieszaniu z słowiańskim klimatem(który ostatnio wywołuje tyle kontrowersji) Sprawdza się świetnie. Oczywiście nie chodzi mi tu o grafikę, o której zaraz. Chodzi mi o postacie, książki, lokacje, dialogii. DIALOGI Najlepszy polski dubbing. To jest pewne. I nie chodzi mi tylko o gry ale a jakiekolwiek dzieło kultury. Postacie mają świetnie dobrane głosy, widać że wiedzą o co chodzi i są spójne. Oczywiście dubbing samego Geralta jest fenomenalny, a to ważny wymóg żeby polubić bohatera. Poza samymi głosami ważne jest to jak dialogii są napisane, a to jeszcze wyższy poziom zaawansowania. Bezkompromisowe dialogii napisane w sposób dojrzały, książkowy wręcz. Postacie nie traktują gracza jak dziecko, któremu wszystko trzeba podać na tacy. A i czasami przy*******ą solidnm k***a, co na pewno cieszy polskich graczy. SYSTM WALKI Jest. FABUŁA Poszukiwania Ciri i powolne odkrywanie co ją łączy z dzikim gonem wyszło świetnie w tej produkcji. Fabuła jest bardzo ciekawa, zawiła, posiada wiele małych detali, nawiazań. Przedewszystkim jest też bardzo realiatczna. Gracz czuje że taka historia mogłaby się zdażyć w świecie wiedźmina. Niektorzy narzekają na motyw ratowania świata przez Geralta. Mi to osobiście nie przeszkadza, a jeżeli komus tak to zapraszam do lektury nastęonego akapitu. ZADANIA POBOCZNE CD Project chwaliło się tym, że udało im sie uniknąć zadań ""Fedexowych"", czyli zadań typu: przynieś, podaj, pozamiataj. Każdy quest w Wiedźminie 3 ma swoją własną historię oraz własne zagadki. Często te historie są bardzo przyziemne, swojskie. Przypominają przygody Geralta z czasów dwóch pierwszych tomów opowiadań. OTWARTY ŚWIAT Jest to chyba najlepiej zrealizowany świat w grach. Każdy centymetr Velen, Skellige czy Novigrady jest zaprojektowany z olbrzymią dbałością. Każdy krzak, każde drzewo, każda szafka w każdym domu. To wszysto ma sens i jest niesamowicie spójne. Mapa jest pełna pytajników do zbadania... Nie pojawiają się one jednak znikąd. Musimy najpierw przeczytać tablicę ogłoszeniową która nam opisuje gdzie dane miejsce się znajduje i co możemy tam znaleźć. Teoretycznie nie trzeba używać minimapy(pomysł na nsstępne przejście gry?) Najbardziej mi jednak zaimponowało to, że na Geralta czeka masa skarbów i sekretów które nie są zaznaczone na mapie. Czasami jest to element budujący klimat, opuszczona chata, zwłoki pary kochanków z listem leżącym zaraz obok. Niekiedy jednak jest to skrzynka z świetnymi przedmiotami leżąca pod jakimś zawalonym drzewem. GRAFIKA Nie bez przyczyny trzecia odsłona przygód Geralta do dziś jest używana jako benchmark we wszelkiego rodzaju testach. Najmocniejszą stroną grafiki jest odwzorowanie natury. Piękne lasy kołyszące się na wietrze, Realistyczne chmury, na które odziałowuje wiatr. Trawy, pola, łąki to wszystko stoi na najwyższym poziomie.",10,2021-01-04,PC,user

ChrisWhiteWolf,"This game is a masterpiece, I cannot say enough good things about it. The gameplay is solid, combat is incredible, the soundtrack is FAN--TASTIC, the graphics are some of the best I have ever seen, the game looks BEAUTIFUL, characters, story, voice acting are all incredible. There is so much to do and explore in this amazing world and 95% of it is fun, unlike most big RPGs like this, where half the content is grindy, repetitive and boring. I seriously cannot put into words how incredible of an experience this game is, so I won't even attempt and I'll try to keep this short. The only bad thing I can say about this game are the glitches, but I haven't run into a single gamebreaking one yet, and CDPR seem to be doing everything they can to fix those ASAP, unlike most developers nowadays. But the pros outnumber the cons at least 10:1. Overall, this is one of the best games I have ever played. You can see the passion and the hard work that CDPR put into this game. It is truly a beautiful and immersive experience. Some parts will make you laugh, others will make you cry and, when the music kicks in and you draw your sword, you will feel like a Witcher. I recommend this game to anyone who likes RPGs and even if you don't, I'd consider giving this one a shot. There is enough content in here to justify a $120 price tag, so don't worry about that. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of the best games I have ever played and the best RPG I have ever played by far.",10,2021-01-03,PC,user

thecrot,"I play games mostly for the story, when I decide if i like a game, story comes first, then gameplay. The main story is great, although not the best the game has to offer in my opinion. At one point in the story, the game was asking me to track someone down, so they can tell me where to find someone else, so that i can find another person, with the ultimate goal of finding ciri, that i wasnt a fan of. The side quests though, are brilliant. There are so many and all vary so much. Its incredible how they managed to make so many different stories. I did the side quests along with the main story, in times where it felt appropriate to do them and when i felt that doing them fitted the plot, or when they were closest to me, which is how I believe they should be done. I know some like to do the side **** after finishing the main story, but i believe this will lower the overall experience. Every single piece of optional dialogue, i clicked on because i was genuinely interested in what was happening and wanted to find out more. I love the lore also, and there is A LOT of lore. I played this game prior to reading the books or playing the previous games, but post watching the show (which i didnt really enjoy) so coming into it i knew almost nothing besides some of the main characters ( i was so confused who dandelion was) and i was still so fascinated by everything. Gameplay wise, its just sorta mediocre. Its not bad but its not all that. It works and when making a build that suits you more, it does get more fun. Also when not spamming quen, the fighting will start to vary more. But the fact that you can literally spam the dodge button in any direction and you will be invincible, makes it kinda easy. Even on deathmarch, the game just didnt give much of a challenge after the beginning. Please do play on deathmarch by the way, because thats the only time u will want to actually use oils and the correct bombs and potions and **** to do certain boss fights, and actually feel like without them you wouldnt be able to do the boss fight anywhere near as effectively. There is a noticeable amount of bugs in the game, roach (the horse) for example i often want to behead because pf constantly getting stuck. Besides that though, any other bugs arnt really that annoying and the ones that are wont show up that often, but they are definitely there. The play time u get from this game as well is amazing. Any play through u do will easily go past the 100h mark. If it wernt for the bugs and if the novigrad part of the game was so “find this person to find this person”, then i would give it a 10 out of 10. But considering the bugs are most times a very minor inconvenience as the horse getting stuck only lasts about a second, and the novigrad part still has interesting lore and stories, i think this game is still the best thing ive ever played, and ive played a lot of story mode games.",9,2021-01-03,PC,user

Easy 150 hrs that will be with you forever, amazing cast of characters, soundtrack out of this world, the gameplay is fantastic but the overall atmosphere is just one of a kind. I'm from EU - Slav so probably that's why it speaks to me more but I'm literally spending my time on google and looking for a game like Witcher 3, only Dragon Age series comes a little close. I really hope that there will be another Witcher game because I'm feeling empty right now. Will probably play NG+ just to ease the pain.

Bakura,"I'm going, to be honest. This is probably my favorite game of all time. I used to do several playthroughs of the same game when I was a kid, but as I grew older, I wouldn't play the story again because it would be boring. However, Witcher 3 came and I'm going for my 3rd playthrough. I'm giving it 9 out of 10 because there are aspects that ruin the little bit of the experience. - Relic itemization is pretty much null. You only use Witcher gear if you want to be at the best level. The relic stuff is pretty much inferior, so it's sold to a shopkeeper (blacksmith, etc). There are only a few items worth equipping. - The 2nd half of an important event (After blah blah) looks kind of rushed and it's bad compared to the 1st half. It gave the sense of ""That's it? Wow I expected more but this was quick"". It has good moments, but I feel like a little development time to polish it would increase the story's rating. - The combat could be a bit better. It's pretty much ""dodge etc"". Even some monsters look repetitive. Aside from this, it's such a breathtaking game.",9,2020-12-19,PC,user

Qarren,"In playing The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt so relatively late into it's life cycle I was at the mercy of incredible expectations created by years of hype and worship of this game. When I finally decided it was time to play through the witcher games (born out of the love for the Netflix adaption), I played through the first, trudged through the second and found myself unshaken by the quality of the 3rd and final entry vs the expectations I had developed for it. I was led to believe the game was a masterpiece of gaming; the ultimate video game. The game is good. The game is very good. But, it's also bad. In every way it pushes the boundaries of what a game and an interactive narrative can be, it also falls short in the most critical or fundamental aspects of this medium. To start, I want to praise the story and how it's told. The story is a truly gripping drama, beginning with the classic investigation of new circumstances and succeeded by a character's need to protect the ones he loves from the big bad. It's not the most original story, but it is as solid as 40 hour investment into a fantasy genre piece can be. More impressive (and I am biased by my background in film here) is the cinematography and character animation during dialogue and cutscenes. CD Project Red truly went to the ends of the Earth to tell a good story in a great way. Every scene is made captivating unlike any other game, aided by great voice acting and direction. You will feel the tension in the drama and the push and pullback in the emotions of the main cast. That is, until you reach the rest. I cannot protest overall at the inclusion of player choice in the narrative, as well implemented as it usually is. However, when the conclusion is summed up by three choices that seemed the most neutral interactions and an aside to the actual plot, my receiving of the 'bad ending' due to my 'negative' choices felt cheap and undeserved. Considering what we've heard recently regarding CD Project Red's treatment of employees with mandatory crunch I guess it should be no surprise that the pragmatic act of accepting payment from a character's father for a job completed is considered a 'negative' choice. I guess they really don't believe in people being compensated for their work. Especially when followed by a fight against a great evil in which all resources should be vital. The other two choices that lead me to the negative outcome left me equally disillusioned. Alas, that shouldn't stop the game from being a generally good experience and so I must move on from narrative to gameplay. Mediocre. That's what it is. Combat, while a vast improvement over the game's predecessors, still feels somewhat tactless. Dodge rolling around a group of enemies while waiting for an opportunity to strike (or wait for an opening use a tool like magic or bombs to create an opportunity to strike if you want to go the, frankly, unnecessary extra step) is still the name of the game. Blocking and countering will most often leave you exposed to a bigger enemy, or from another enemy to the side, and so I play rolly-polly and cut down the first fool to run up to me once I've finished my impromptu break-dancing on the battlefield. Otherwise, a wholly unsatisfying experience, but not necessarily a frustrating or janky one. So, mediocre it is. Where the jank does lie is in the mounts. I hope you like fast travel, because despite my eagerness in the beginning of the game to never use it in order to fully take in the beautifully realised world full of amazing detail, by the end my faithful horse companion, Roach, was the biggest clot to ever trot and I expelled him from my experience. Auto-following a road seemed like a great idea when I first loaded up the game, until I realised just how automated it was. Roach follows the nearest path in any split in the road, whether or not the quest path suggests that route or not, or whether you're trying to nudge him left or right or not. Best practice is to take manual control for a moment and then return to auto-horsing. But that's the weakest of my complaints. I wouldn't try sprinting on Roach if I were you, because it changes his physics and suddenly every slight dint in the road becomes an impenetrable barricade as you watch your horsie gallop on the spot like an invisible treadmill guides his every step. As for boats, just don't bring them near anything. I mean it. Steering them can be awkward enough without the boat being randomly magnetically attracted to nearby rocks, regardless of which direction you're actually sailing. Then you get to watch damage magically appear on your boat as quickly as my dad disappeared when I was a kid. My feelings on the seemingly more tactical progression and levelling are more subjective so I'll merely say it wasn't what I was looking for and otherwise sum up The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt as an amazing attempt to be something more than just a game, so well in fact that it forget to be a fun game first.",8,2020-12-18,PC,user

And you are crying when mods delete your irrelevant, obviously lying and manipulative reviews? Oh the irony, get a life trolls. Metacritic gives its users a way to rate games, and what do they do? They illegitimatize it, they make it a laughing stock for anybody that comes to read this madness. If you are so angry go review Cyberpunk, I have no idea what this game has to do with your raging stupidity. Your review are lies, butthurt, stupid, full of irrelevant nonsense unrelated to this game or obvious lies and copy pasta. Thats why it should be removed from Metacritic. If you are a reasonable person who is against review bombing, make sure to report these stupid reviews so they get removed, an army of trolls is invaded this game, because they didnt like another game, hilarious and pathetic and sad (all at the same time). **** Trolls.

Julinitot,"""Funny"" how some people come here in December 2020 out of pure hate to criticize CD projekt. The witcher 3 is an amazing rpg with a solid main story and incredibly well written side quests. It is a joy to venture such a beautiful and full of content open world - you'll get more than 50h of fun, probably more than 100h if you like to take your time and try different story choices. The gameplay is not perfect and parcour especially feels a little bit clunky in the beginning but imo, it is still 10 times better than what red dead or gta **** yeah, deal with it, the game is worth it ;) And trust me, combat gets interesting once you've mastered all the options at your disposal and turned the difficulty to hard. I personally appreciate how enemy level scaling is done. I really hate it in so many other games when every time you level up, basic enemy also get stronger. What the point then if you don't feel more powerful? In conclusion, the witcher 3 is definitely one of the best game of last Gen. I really hope the devs recover from cyberpunk somehow and come back with a new rpg based on sapkowski's universe.",9,2020-12-17,PC,user

Combat is kinda too easy created, you just click left mouse button to do fast attack and right mouse button to do stronger one, but animations of attacks are rly great, whole rolling on the ground thing is kinda too overpowered, on the hardest difficulty you can avoid almost every incoming damage with that trick if you know when you press dodge. Whole story is rly amazing if you love Witcher books and whole universe you will meet many characters which you should already know if you are fan and you will just love design of them. Expansions for this game are rly good also, stories inside them are deep also new characters too introduced in that expansions.

LoLerScholar,"What more is there to say about The Witcher 3? At this point in 2020, it's universally praised as pretty much the best western RPG on PC, and rightfully so. I don't want to rehash stuff that other people have said in other reviews, so I'll briefly touch on a few things that I appreciated and didn't appreciate about the game. From a story / character perspective, my biggest takeaway from the game was how well it depicted human relations as a 'contract'. As a witcher, Geralt takes various contracts that are agreed upon, whether it's to kill a monster or find a certain person for money. This game explores this metaphor of a 'contract' within relationships and society in such powerful ways. You see this in the interactions that Geralt has with powerful rulers of various regions, and you even see this in Geralt's romantic relationship(s) in the game. The game is always hitting you with this metaphor and it does it exquisitely. Another huge reason this game is a 10/10 is because of its voice acting and dialogue delivery. It's on a totally different level than most other RPGS. The personalities, wit, emotion, and humor shine through so well because of this. You pretty much feel like you're watching a movie when you're playing the game, all the way from the first full motion video sequence to the end. It's so good! In terms of criticisms, the biggest one I'd point to is the combat. I think this is pretty well documented, but the combat felt a bit janky, like I could never fully control what Geralt was doing during fights. The pace of fights feel a little off when you're pressing 'tab' to switch witcher signs as well. I was pretty much doing the same thing for the whole game: use Quen, switch to Igni, roll around and use light attacks. With this said, it was still a lot of fun so I'm not complaining too much. So with that out of the way, I'd definitely agree that the Witcher 3 is the gold standard of western RPGS. You gotta play it !",10,2020-12-06,PC,user

genarkandur,Definitely one of my favorite games. Story and the Witcher universe is so large that you can easily get lost in this world. Loved every hour i spent in the game. Missions are fun and have diversity. There are also a lot of quests to do. Soundtrack is just amazing. Characters are so real. There are some technical problems like the control of the Roach but after all it's a 10/10,10,2020-12-01,PC,user

On the one hand, I am sad that I ended it and wish I could forget everything to experience it all over again. But on the one hand I am very grateful for this fantastic experience. I played this game in 2020 because there is only good talk about it. The ratings are almost only positive as well as the awards speak for it. And how am I supposed to say it? I wasn’t disappointed at all. At first I played it halfheartedly but then after a long break I was so tied up. This experience with the game is not comprehensible in words.

The main story is exceptional and oooh boy, the side-quest, it feels like a main quest in other games. I think you could have at least 3 minimum replayability in this game according to your gamestyle. (full magic, full crit, brute power). Should I mention gwent? I got so addicted to this mini-game it consumed so much of my time since I stack my deck. The combat is wonderful and quite challenging, you can dodge, use magic, counter, etc. Just like dark souls.

Графика - соглашусь, что не NEXTGEN, НО ... она однородна и все же красива даже на 2020 год, причем прекрасная работа со светом Звук - услада для ушей, каждая композиция, каждый взмах меча, вой собаки, кудахтанье курицы на заднем плане, в целом невероятная работа. Управление - очень много механик, вполне удобно проходить как на геймпада, так и на клавамышь Сюжет - самая сильная сторона произведения и это касается не только основного сюжета, но и поразительно продуманные до мелочей побочные задания. Реиграбельность - помимо продуманности историй, есть отыгрыш персонажа, как в любой уважающей себя RPG, а именно это выбор, который предстоит игроку, плюс разные методы прохождения. Левел-дизайн - да, это относится к графике, но как человек, живущий в стране СНГ, хочется выделить отличную работу дизайнеров, ты будто и вправду возвращаешься к себе в деревню, в которой гостил у бабули, причем в некоторых пейзажах узнаешь реальные места. И это в целом придает суперскую атмосферу Можно долго описывать о том, какую шедевральную работу проделали Поляки, но теперь из-за CD PROJECT RED, у других разработчиков появилась планка, которой как минимум надо придерживаться, а ещё лучше, преодолеть.

louis2257,"After well over 1000 hours and easily over 15 playthroughs this game is a 10/10. The Witcher 3 has set the standard in RPG games so much so we see copy-paste RPGs in today’s gaming landscape. From the deep monster fighting, stunning landscapes and intricate story this is one of if not the best RPGs of all time. With it on sale often it’s worth every penny including the two major DLCs. The DLCs have been ranked higher than most games during their release and they can easily last between 10-50 hours. If you do not like open world games with a massive world, story and lots of content this isn’t for you. But do keep in mind it’s defiantly worth a go as the content is very unique and of a higher quality than most games to date.",10,2020-08-31,PC,user

Man_of_duty,"Because of the overpraising fanboys I had high expectations. The introduction was disappointing with the gameplay being average at best and the story still being uninteresting and folded. After you fully know the basics you will get slowly attached to the Witcher's world. This is the point where it gets addictive thanks to the story and its characters. Dialogue options are vast and the impact of player's choices can change the course of the game and the relationships with many characters. This is a great motivation for focusing more on the gameplay as the rewards can be an improved bonding with the other characters or a fashionable strong equipment. I love the art style and the atmosphere, it feels like a dark fairy tale of hunting monsters but also like a soap opera with the drama of everyone around you. This is also one of the few open world games that has side quests' quality on the same level as the main story, that being said the map still has many repetitive locations and the gameplay is hardly changed throughout the journey apart from the variety of monsters.",8,2020-08-05,PC,user

MackiePro,"I was always a fan of the witcher series so I might be biased but all I can say is that this game is an absolute masterpiece. I understand common complains about the combat system but once you start playing on the highest difficulty, the combat becomes more tactical and enjoyable. The game is an open-world RPG so don’t expect dark souls or DMC style combat. The game world is absolutely beautiful and the graphics still hold up. The story is great although personally I think the climax takes place earlier than I would have liked. The side quests are masterfully crafted, each one feels different and helps you learn more about the characters and the world. Gwent is without doubts the best mini game ever created in a video game. Although the game has/had a few problems on launch, CDPR has done a great job at fixing the most annoying and common complains.",10,2020-07-26,PC,user

Whenever I turned on the game I dreaded looking at my inventories or anything in the menus for that matter, there was just so, so, so much going on in there. But not only that but the world itself. It's definitely oversaturated which I feel works against the game. I mean, that's only if you don't always want to stick to the main quest and meander off and explore. I love exploring open world games but the Witcher really made me feel as though I only wanted to play the main quest and ignore all the things on the side.

Metacritz,"After playing this game for over 150 hours on my PS4 I decided to give it a go on PC with the enhanced graphical options and improved frame rate I wasn't disappointed, this game looks gorgeous on PC and the 60 fps feel way better than the locked 30 fps on consoles. This game is absolutely massive in terms of scale. You can focus on the main story but you would be missing out on the awesome side quests and world content that this game has to offer, you'll travel the monster infested lands, sail across the vast seas, see many different monsters and amazing landscapes. The points of interest and secondary quests in this world feel natural and masterfully crafted, and the people who give you the quests genuinely feel like developed and polished characters that you can connect with and enjoy as you complete their quests and see how they grow as characters. Of all the secondary objectives the witcher contracts are the best and most challenging. You pretty much track down the monsters that terrorize villages and cities, as a witcher you are given contracts to kill these monsters, you can prepare yourself for the fight by reading the bestiary entries and learning about the monsters weaknesses and what is required to kill them, Tracking and killing the monsters in this game is an incredibly rewarding experience. Regarding the main story, it's very well written, characters feel polished and alive, the decision making is a nice feature that helps you craft your own witcher persona, the dialogue can at times be corky but even those moments help by bringing some comedy and light into a world that is harsh and cruel, there are a lot of important paths you can take in the story that will contribute to which ending you end up getting, there are some emotional moments that feel amazing and help create the perfect atmosphere and story telling the game needs to present its amazing story. Without a doubt one of the best games of this generation and one of the best games ever made, big shout out to CD Project Red for not only making this game but crafting two awesome DLCs and providing intensive bug fixing and updating to the game, definitely deserves the 10 out of 10 and game of the year title.",10,2020-07-17,PC,user

Si bien los trailers que había visto me gustaban mucho, nunca me hacia un tiempo para poder empezarlo. Hasta hace un par de meses atrás que al fin pude empezar a jugarlo. Debo decir que me fascinó, que una vez comenzé no pude parar, abandoné los otros dos shooter de moda que estaba jugando pues este me atrapó de una manera indescriptible. La historia es simplemente hermosa, muy atrapante y entretenida. El gameplay es muy bueno y no es difícil de entender al igual que las habilidades. En pocas palabras es recomendable 100 %. A mi parecer es mas fácil que Dark Souls por ejemplo, pero es mil veces mas entretenido, yo prefiero the witcher mucho mas, pues en su mundo abierto hay muchas historias como misiones secundarias variadas que te regalan horas y horas de diversión. Recomendable hacer las secuandarias pues son muy entretenidas.",10,2020-07-14,PC,user
Zephyr950,"The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt is my game of the generation. It perfectly balances all of its core elements, all of which combine to form an incredible experience that I will treasure forever. The game looks phenomenal. Its environments are so fully realized and are all distinct to one another, each having its own unique landmarks and breathtaking landscapes. Character models in particular look really great and are integrated into the game world excellently. The music and overall sound design is definitely one of the game's highlights as well. The way the music is used throughout the entire game, how it matches the mood and tone of every story scene, how it adds to the atmosphere and world building of the game, and how it evokes certain emotions and feelings that the game wants the player to feel made playing the game such an incredible experience. Gameplay is really great as well. The combat may not be the best combat ever in an RPG, but was still good and felt great to play. Animations as well help accentuate the impact of attacks, specifically the executions, and overall movement throughout the combat encounters. There is also a lot of variety in the way encounters are handled. Mechanics like potions, bombs, and spells elevate the gameplay to new heights and make combat incredibly varied. Enemy variety adds another layer of complexity to combat. All enemies have varying weaknesses that the player can use and exploit in order to win against them. The game is also very rich in content. The game world is huge and the amount of exploration, points of interest and side quests in the game is staggering. It is a game that can easily give around 100+ hours just for the amount of exploration. Exploring the game world is also very rewarding as various crafting materials, recipes, and treasures can be found all over the game world; all of which help in game progression and complexity. All of these aspects combine perfectly with what I think is the best aspect of the game, the story. The story is phenomenally written and executed. It is a complex, overarching story filled with choices and character decisions, all of which impact the way the story moves forward and branches out, which in turn, further immerses the player in the the game world. On the surface, it may seem like just another tale about monsters and magic. But at its core, it is a story that succeeds in being both an action-packed, mythological epic and a character-driven narrative filled with emotion and conflict. But the most important aspect of any story is without a doubt, the characters. All of the characters in the game bring the story to life. It is through these characters that I got to experience this world and what it has to offer. Throughout the course of the journey, I got to spend a lot of time with them and it is through this time spent that made me connect with them as if they were indeed real. They have their own problems, fears, emotions, and struggles, and the more that I got to know these characters, the more that I got emotionally connected to them. All of this is due to how phenomenally well realized they all are. I cared for, understood, and most of all, loved them. The characters in this game indeed made such a huge impact in my life, and I will forever treasure the game because of this. All of that being said, I do have minor issues in the game like some technical glitches and few repetitive quests, which are normal for vast, open-world RPGs like this one. Yet these issues did not stop me from loving the game any less. The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt is the best game I have ever played. It's a game that captivated me from start to finish with its breathtaking visuals, incredible sound design, expansive exploration, gameplay depth and variety, and most of all, its remarkable story. Sure, there may not be a so-called ""perfect game"" out there, but The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt is damn near close. 10/10.",10,2020-07-13,PC,user

Mats2468,"This is a honest and spoiler-free review of The Witcher 3. This game is currently the highest rated user score game on Metacritic to this date, which sounds to me that this game is going to be very good, but I left with mixed opinions. First off, i dont think it's a masterpiece what people make it out to be, instead, i find it a decent game, but not that great. Graphics in this game still holds up incredibly good to this date, especially in ultra settings. This is some of the reasons why people gave this game a 10 when it came out, but imo, graphics is not everything to suddenly make this game a masterpiece. The majority of time you playing this game it comes to dialogue from diffirent quests and main story, a very slow based dialogue that it feels forever to end, and the way characters talk, it is very tedious to watch and listen too, i cant seem to understand why people loving this. The main story however, its way too complex imo, its somewhat hard to pay attention to the infinite amount of dialogue because the lack of cutscenes that could come with a bit of action or ""epic moments"", and the main story is unnecessary long (90 hours including travels from A to B, complete seveal side quests to level up to). Now to the open world, and daym those worlds look looks beautiful! It's quite impressive that CD Project Red has managed to create many maps with so many different beautiful landscapes that are ready to explore, but it is also important to note that not all areas in the game are not recommended to go to in the beginning, due to the level progression, something which is typical in RPG games. The combat feels very repetitive and there is a lack of opportunities to unlock different ways to attact against enemies. Well combat in a game determines a lot if the game is good, and Witcher's is not one of them. One thing I have to be honest guys, is that this game offers so much content for the money you paying for and that is a big positive about the game. Overrall, I can't believe the praise of this game. The Witcher 3 stands out to be the most overated game in history of video games (Terms of user score on Metacritic). Its a good game, dont misunderstand me. I really appreciated you reading my review of the game :)",6,2020-07-10,PC,user

Основная сюжетная линия интересная, но не шедевральная, игра ценна своими сайд квестовыми линиями и количеством выбора. Мир хорошо проработан благодаря книжному базису. Графика красивая, но если придраться, то есть мыльные текстуры и странная физика предметов, но это не мешает играть. Рпг составляющая своеобразная. Мне лично она понравилась своей казуальностью, хардкорщикам наверное не зайдет. Система лута лично мне понравилась, единственный минус это слабость не ведьмачьих доспехов.

Syrelix,"I bought the game for a cheap 15 bucks on the steam summer sale and what can I say? This game has everything! Meaningful dialogue and quest choices, authentic/realistic medieval armor, weapon design, and architecture. A rough and dirty atmosphere with a lot of swearing, violence, and sex. A very adult take on the RPG-genre that is very refreshing and enjoyable. Since the game is already a few years old, it is also not that demanding on your hardware. I only find minor things annoying, like the fact that there are 300+ different common crafting components that clutter your inventory, (it could have been a bit simpler) and a few other things, but I won't go too much into detail. The positive aspects far outweigh the drawbacks. If you played and enjoyed games like the Gothic series, you will very much like this game.

NightHunter88,"I have never played the Witcher’s first game but I started with the second and waited a long time to get my hands on this beauty. I bought the complete game on Xbox One with all the DLC and when I migrated to PC I bought it again and definitely do not regret supporting CDPR as they are the pinnacle in game developers with a customer satisfaction focus. The game by itself is a masterpiece IMO, the gameplay has evolved enormously since the second one and this is the developer’s first open world game and they did a great job at making it come to live. You won’t find vast areas with nothing on them, there is always something to do. The story is really good and that is a great deal thanks to the writer of the original books, the character are really well done and the game is pretty easily more than 50 hours long. In addition, please take the time to do the side quests, those are the best side quests included in a game so far and it is clear that development team put a great deal of effort into making them worth your time in completing them. Overall, this is definitely a 10/10 game for me.",10,2020-06-28,PC,user

Pumpk1n_,"Played 400 hrs of Witcher 3 and still currently at New Game + , I will give it 95/100. Most impressive parts: - Smooth gameplay and massive game content included. The DLCs also included great amount of content. The player could really immerse themselves in the witcher world. - Story itself was good, while the delivery was really great. You would have to face hard choices in the game. - Large amount of interesting side quests and witcher contracts, that helps building the witcher world. - An enjoyable experience in fighting in the first play through. Swords combined with signs, blade oil , potions, makes you feel like combating as a witcher. However on 2nd playthrough some of the builds are becoming much less effective because of enemy level. - How about a round of Gwent ? The game also had some flaws, for example, sudden deaths jumping from high ground, Roach not responding to commands very well, etc. The best open world RPG game I have ever played, so far.",10,2020-06-28,PC,user

Paltalmen,"Was soll man zu diesem Spiel denn noch sagen? Die Witcher-Reihe von CD Projekt Red hat sich seit dem ersten Teil sehr weiter entwickelt und mit dem dritten und letzten Teil der Serie, seinen Höhepunkt erreicht. Die Spielwelt ist unfassbar belebt und jede Stelle im Spiel sieht aus wie aus einem Ölgemälde geklaut. Große Städte und kleine Dörfer sind gleichermaßen belebt und fühlen sich auch so an. Die Hauptstory ist nicht wirklich das beste aber auch nicht uninteressant, könnte aber auch etwas epischer sein. Durch die Story wird man aber auch Indirekt auf die Nebenquests geleitet die bisher noch ungeschlagen, meiner Meinung nach, die besten sind die es in der Videospiel Geschichte gibt. Jede Nebenaufgabe fühlt sich an wie eine kleine Geschichte, die genau so viel Liebe und Details abbekommen haben wie die Hauptstory. Das Kampfsystem ist dagegen eher sehr vereinfacht, erfüllt aber seinen Zweck. Wer allerdings ein Deepes System will ist hier falsch. Auch eher unglücklich ist das Navigationssystem. Wenn man von Punkt A nach Punkt B reiten will und dafür auf seiner Karten das Ziel markiert, wird einem dafür auf seiner Minimap ein vorgeschlagener Weg gezeigt. Das Problem dabei ist allerdings das man dann die meiste Zeit auf die Minimap schaut, anstatt auf die Welt zu **** gibt zwar die Option die Minimap auszustellen, würde ich persönlich aber nicht empfehlen, da die Welt an sich nicht genügend Anhaltspunkte zur Orientierung bietet. Auch kann es manchmal etwas überwältigen wenn man die Karte öffnet und einem tausende an Fragezeichen entgegen springen, die interessante Orte markieren sollen. Das bringt mich noch darauf das letztendlich auch die Welt von Witcher 3 auf dem Open-World Prinzip von Ubisoft basiert, anstatt irgendwelcher türme die man erklimmen muss um Aktivitäten in der Nähe auf der Karte auf zu decken, gibt es in jedem Dorf eine Infotafel an der Aufträge ausgehängt werden, man stolpert eher selten einfach so über irgendwelche Ereignisse in der Spielwelt. Das Spiel bietet liebenswerte Charaktere, eine vollgepackte Welt die frei zu erforschen ist und viel sidecontent bietet, der nie wirklich anstrengend wird. Abgesehen davon sind die DLCs unfassbar riesig und weißen die selbe Qualität auf wie das Hauptspiel.",9,2020-06-27,PC,user

It was my favorite game of all time but now that 5 year passed I remember many bad things too like long loading bars, bad movement control and got bored by some story parts while replaying. So yea while it's one of my favorite I think I played it to often to see the flaws more than the good parts.

LanceVanceDance,"This game will definitely remain in my heart forever. I give it a 9,7/10, but the way metacritic works I can only settle for a 9 or a 10, so 10 it is. In short: this game is a masterpiece. It's not perfect, but damn does it come really close. It just hits this fantasy spot very few games ever managed. Definitely one of the best games of the decade. Pros: -enveloping atmosphere -magical fantasy scenery -big open environments -good graphics, even for 2020 -good non-linear story, perfect quest-story synergy -abundance of content -solid character customization, ""earning the gear"" -decent skill development system -solid 3rd person slasher combat -interesting quest design -challenging, impactful story decisions -diverse variety of monsters and enemies -extensive fantasy lore, based on the Sapkowski books -reasonably priced, big Expansions Cons: -no custom character creation, you play as Geralt -magic abilities rather simple, but this is reasoned by story -not completely open world, BUT world divided into parts, which are completely open and are very massive, so world size is not really a problem. The way I would describe The Witcher 3 and it's expansions, is it's like being dropped into an uncensored and brutal Fairy Tale by the Grimm Brothers - the atmosphere in this game is just perfect, and everything combines so well to uphold it. The story of the game is quality and engaging, a proper fantasy take on world dynamics, war, big politics and society, in a way akin to the Game of Thrones TV series, except without an embarrassing Season 8 fiasco. Not in a preachy way, mind you, like so many games try to be nowadays. It is filled with hard dilemmas and choices which resonate, and frequently impact the story in unexpected ways. It's one of those games which doesn't treat it's side-quests like lame bulk-material, a doesn't separate them from the story in a gamey, obvious and clear-cut way. ""Hand-crafted with careful attention to detail"" is perhaps the best way to put in words how this game feels. Overall, a very well crafted experience. One of the only games where you can feel the passion and care of the developers towards their game. One of the only games where you can feel it wasn't just treated as another yearly piece of software. This game will definitely remain in my heart forever.",10,2020-06-20,PC,user

FiftyEightDK,"Пожалуй, самая переоценённая игра за всю историю игроиндустрии. Боевая система скучна и однообразна. Почти любого противника можно заспамить отскоками, кого нельзя отскоками – перекатами. Бесящая система ведьмачьего чутья. Сайд квесты в игре интересны. Их, не то чтобы много, к тому же большинство из них выполняются довольно быстро. Присутствует гринд. Знаки вопроса, которые, в основном, представляют из себя какой-нибудь сундук с сокровищами. Если захотите скрафтить все виды ведьмачьей брони, придется зачищать одну и ту же крепость в дополнении ""кровь и вино"". Основный сюжет неплох, хоть местами проседает, дополнение каменные сердца шикарное, кровь и вино – на любителя. Насчёт персонажей. Геральт в этой части совсем раскис, очень слабые агрессивные диалоги по отношению к тем, кто Геральта хотел убить/обмануть. Цири все ждали с первой части, но здесь она показана ужасно, вызывает лишь гнев от её постоянного нытья. Йеннефер – ну тут всё по канону (стервозная, но любящая, циничная дама) Трисс же окончательно превратили в богиню без минусов. В любом случае, игра обязательна к ознакомлению.",8,2020-06-19,PC,user

It's gotta be the best non-MMO RPG I have ever played if you look past the bugs (which we kinda have to do if we're going to recommend the game as the bugs are temporary annoyances compared to all the fun you will have). You don't have to be a hipster or anything, just be honest and ask yourself if Skyrim really doesn't deserve the throne for best RPG ever, because no individual can make that decision, it's the gaming community as a whole, and Skyrim sold incredibly well because it's universally appealing to everyone in the gaming community of those who liked it.

rokushowins,"Finally got to play this game and ... it is a huge disappointment , first let's start with the gameplay. - I taked my time to read some reviews and as others have said it feels more like watching a movie than actually playing a videogame, there are even small side quest that have like 6 cutscenes,,, you only have to pick a dialogue option and walk a bit. -The combat is also very limited, you can't jump, you can't use stealth and there are only 5 spells, so you pretty much have to fight the same style through all the game, so the combat gets very boring and repetitive after a while, even worse if you decide to do another playthrough. -The weapons are also uninspired, and the crossbow is one of the worst weapons i've used on a videogame, it goes from doing almost no damage to one-hit kill the same monsters if you are under water,it doesn't make any sense -The story was also forgettable, nothing i haven't seen in others games, you pretty much are the world savior, people complained about this type of stories in others games but in this game they decided that the story was great, wich is incomprehensible. But the worst part of this game is the open world design, aside of good graphics the open world feels very empty, compared to for example, Skyrim, cdproject chosed quantity over quality, there are much more npcs but 99% of the npcs just curse and spit, they don't talk with you and don't add anything to the game, in skyrim every npc was unique in some way, and they had something to say or even a quest related. i guess that cdproject knew that the open world was too empty so they decided to put a mark on the few npc's that have something to say or a quest to give you, wich makes exploration pointless since you already know where you have to go and with who you have to talk every time you get to a new town or city. -Other huge problem in this open world is that everything feels too scripted, theres no random events, so every playthrough is going to be the same aside the choices you make in certain points of the main quest or side quests, so the open world is pretty much just a barren land to get through your next quest -The dungeons are also too samey, in Skyrim every dungeon was different and had some story, item, or quest related to it, instead on the witcher 3 most of the dungeons are just small caves with a monster to hunt and nothing else -Aside from novingrad and maybe skellige port every town or city is copypasted and as i have said because of the npcs system that cdproject chosed, most of those ""hubs"" don't have a single npc to talk to, the npcs are just walking around repeating the same words or making spitting sounds when you try to talk with them, very sad",1,2020-05-29,PC,user

DudDOOD,"It does not have vr support, so talking about immersion is kind of silly. Unless the scale of the game is huge. That's how witcher slowly builds up immersion with hours and hours of gameplay to the level of today's vr games. Also, for more immersion it's better to play on highest difficulty, because witchers are fragile in this hostile world and die after falling from 10 feet height. Guess, Pareto Principle is the norm, and it's okay that today a game with many clues about that it's unfinished is treated like a final product. Many pros, many cons. Won't enumerate them all, my personal biggest letdown is that there are no puzzles to solve. You, a medieval detective, just go to the marked location, click on marked objects, and puzzle solves itself for you. Basically same as Arkham Knight. Geralt just tells the player what to do, it becomes such a routine so quickly. I actually bought this game because of detective vibes it has. Because fantasy is mostly all the same to the point of annoying, and this felt so new and so fun. However, nope, cdpr also thinks that apparently the least risky move is to treat players like idiots. I wonder how did they come out with this for such a big game. The bigger the game the safer it is to experiment even if just a little bit. Could at least add some puzzle side quests, or could add adjustable puzzle difficulty by hints option if there were any in the main quests. I will still keep my hopes high for Cyberpunk, because witcher expansions show that developers kinda realized that they **** up the potential in wild hunt, and added some puzzles into hearts of stone, just a little bit. It's almost nothing though, and very-very basic. Could be such a masterpiece gameplay-wise. I mean it's fun to follow investigation in blood and wine, but it could be so much more interactive and therefore more fun. Gwent was fun exactly because of the point I am highlighting.

Bottlecaps,"It would surprise no one to tell you the witcher 3 is a masterpiece it is definitely among the greatest games of all time at the very least for me personally. even as far to go to say that the witcher 3 is game of the decade and id have to agree Story: picking up after a wee bit of a time skip after the second game , geralt searches for his long lost lover yenifer. when he finds her she tells him their adoptive daughter and biological daughter to the ruler of nilfgaard has reappeared after being missing for years and there begins a grand saga of a hero's journey. the only difference is you play as the mentor to the hero and you are just trying to survive till the end of the movie. the story has a lot of variation based entirely on your choices witch i love because it's always complex , you never know if your decision will get some one killed or not because you just don't know , it's a ripple effect on the story and you won't know until you see the ripples , who geralt falls in love with , what are his priorities, how dose he wear his hair , all of this is the players choice but how geralt feels at any given time is up to geralt but somehow they melded how geralt feels and what the player does really well Story: 10/10 World building: what made me want to play the witcher was the tv show and id say the tv show is good , henry cavil went all out in his portrayal of geralt . a few miscasts aside its a good show , but not great. its world building is the weakest part of the show as im sure it will get better with time as more seasons are made , The witcher 3 however made me understand geralt so well , who he is , and what his place in the world is geralt has a job , he has friends ,colleagues , deals with the government and even his own family or at least who he considers family. everyone has a place in the world, the witchers a dying breed of monster slayers. mages immortalized and beautified by magic all in search of new power. ciri the child of a human elf mix breed with special powers. but also the little things and the landscapes make up this huge vast and beautiful world to explore Worldbuilding: 10/10 Graphics: after 180 hours i never got tired of looking at this game , its all screen shot worthy , landscapes and shrubbery is beautiful. its characters are beautiful even their flaws and imperfections are beautiful. what call of duty dose for guns , that fit in your hand level of detail that makes you vividly imagine holding it yourself. the witcher 3 dose that with locations every small wooden bridge over a stream brought me back to a place when i was kid exploring a forest by my grandparents cottage. how ever after 180 hours , some of the reused character models just with different cloths did get old same with some of the animations especially for the side quests. but that is me being very nitpicky Graphics: 9.8/10 Gameplay: video games are at their best when the gameplay tells a story as well as the story. every fight , every hunt, every boss battle is a story , and it all feels so seamless sure there are cut scenes and cuts but there is usually reason for them. but going from side quest to story to stumbling across a bandit camp and getting attacked all feels coherent and unified it feels like its geralt's life. in the game industry there is the innovators , the copiers and the learners. copiers occasionally make a good game , innovators take risks to make a good game , but learners always make good games. cd projeckt red is such a dev team. where witcher 2 plays more like a darksouls where the witcher 3 plays more like the batman arkham games combat has a flow and a beat to it that just works for the witcher as a franchise mix that with a pretty good inventory and rpg elements this game is just great to play Gameplay: 10/10 Sound design: every little detail was scrutinised over in this game, the sword clangs the arrows what bandits and enemies say and the music, some of the most beautiful battle music is in this game and i loved it even if it does get very repetitive as its always the same song and same gospel woman going HUAHHHHH but at least its a good song. the voice acting is probably the weakest part of the game how ever in any other game id say its amazing. geralt is played perfectly and with all the branching story lines and choices id say that was no easy task, i will have to call out triss voice actress as in every game she has felt awkward and wooden but with each game she improves witch cd could have easily re cast her but im glad they did not because they believe in her and that's just good to do . but having geralt say "" what now you piece of filth"" a million times was aggravating Sound design: 9/10 10+10+9.8+10+9= 48.8 48.8/5= 9.76/10 The witcher 3 is a masterpiece and a must play it is everything a video game can and should be a true work of art",10,2020-04-28,PC,user

lastfox,"The Witcher3 is a pretty good open-world game. The graphic and the world-building is gorgeous. The combat system is solid, nothing outstanding but it does it's job. The potion system gives it a little bit of edge. But I have to say the main quest is a bit boring with the usual 'chosen one' narrative and it always gets interrupted by the flashbacks of Ciri, which are not fun to play. The game could have done better without them, it would also add more to the mystery. The thing that kept me going were the side quests to be honest. They are quite well written and seemed to have more urgency than the main quest. It's a bit of a bummer that sometimes the quest schedule can be confusing because there's lack of additional information. Certain quests have to be paused because you didn't level up yet, so at some point you will be juggling with a lot of unfinished quests that you have to jump back and forth. And some you can't even return to, because they have a time limit. The game certainly kept me entertained for one and a half months, but after I finished all the side quests it started to lose interest in the main quest completely. But the game is well worth it's money.",9,2020-04-22,PC,user

LazyLoad08,"I gotta say - this game is beautiful visually and the story telling is actually awesome. After finishing the Witcher book saga, I was craving for more and got my filling, which I enjoyed thoroughly. However... I would lie if I said this game did not suffer from any issues. I had to mod the game for any feeling of immersiveness while maintaining some usefulness. The minimap and player position shown on the map are kinda disruptive and take away from the immersion. I want to see the world, not icons on the minimap. I had to mod because of seriously bad decisions regarding combat and exploration. The inability to jump while in compat is just baffling. Some things I felt were not good: quests following a NPC - it just doesn't work well. They go at a speed between your walking and running speed. It's annoying especially if you need to stay in a certain range. Fistfights - just awful overall. Ugh. As I mentioned, the story was great. Felt kinda weird to do all these secondary quests when the game kept on telling me how urgent getting to Ciri was. At first, I tried to do just that to keep maximum immersion, but it was unsustainable. So then I just went around doing those secondary quests and making up excuses for why I had to take that detour. Feel that could be done better. Overall, a huge and very good game not without gameplay flaws, which are more than compensated by the story and the world. Must play for Witcher fans, definite recommend for RPG fans.",8,2020-04-18,PC,user

kotulp,"!!This Review is in Slovak Language!! (Played on PC and PS4) Dlho som váhal či si to kúpiť alebo nie. A nakoniec som sa rozhodol že to predsa len skúsim a neľutujem. Witcher 3 je podľa mňa najlepšia RPG hra. Prepracovaný herný svet a príbeh, proste kvalitná hra. Toto čo dokázal CDPR sa dlho nikomu a žiadnej hernej spoločnosti nepodarí prekonať ešte veľmi dlho. A dokonca si trúfnem povedať že prekonať to môže jedine CDPR s nejakým ďalším titulom. Questy ktoré sa tu nachádzajú sú také originálne že to ani nieje možné.Ľutujem len to že som to nekúpil skôr. Klady + Príbeh + Postavy + Postavy ako telo(Yennefer/Triss...) + Humor + Open world + Detaily + Optimalizácia + + + + + + + + Zápory A aby sme len nechválili... - Klepna(kôň) občas zaklepne o nejakú prekážku - Combat na koni nieje zrovna to pravé orechové - občas sa stane že za Vaším oknom znova vykukne slnko - možno prídete o pár priateľov lebo proste hráte Witchera - možno prídete o pár členov rodiny počas hrania - možno zmeškáte narodenie svojho dieťaťa, jeho narodeniny, jeho maturitu... - možno Vám pretečie celý život medzi klávesnicou... - A ak ste si mysleli že nejaká hra je vaša obľúbená Witcher Vás vyvedie z omylu.

Лучшая в жанре боёвка и система прокачки. Билдов можно собрать немеренно, благодаря большому количеству механик. ОЧЕНЬ красивая графика, из-за неё удовольствие приносит просто перемещение по миру (который в свою очередь совсем не пустой). Бешеная реиграбельность игры меня удивила (раз 5-6 прошёл).

Loot **** will be pleased, story **** will rejoice and head bashers will be covered in blood. It satisfies everyone and it was made by a company who to this day remains as one of the good guys. The story is amazing and the folklore complements it so damn well. You will want to read every side note and do every side quest just to get to know this world a bit better.

If there was no combat at all i probably wouldn't hurt this title much due to the fact the combat is easily the worst part of the game. The combat is clunky and easy to spam quen with constant rolls. While this game is not perfect it is as close to perfect as the gaming industry has seen, I would give it a 9 due to the combat but considering no other studio can match this title it is currently the best game of all time and therefore deserves a perfect score.

Corefitz,"Waow... I have no words. What an absolute waste of time and money. Okay okay, so: First off, I've tried playing The Witcher 1... didn't even get past the tutroial, so that set a bar for me right from the start. Now I've heard so many great things about The Witcher 3 through the years, but I kept my distance because of an extremely bad and unsatifying experience. With that said, I decided to give The Witcher 3 a try... and oh boy do I regret everything about it. First thing that messes with me is the mouse sensitivity, either you put that thing ALL the way down and make navigation in menus insufferably slow, but your camera doesn't fly round when you're in character mode... or you just have 2000% motion blur all the time, but are able to normally navigate menus. So... Actually starting a new game! Now, as a brand new player to the series, I went all in on the tutorials, getting things explained and shown, little did I know I would have to sit and just read for hours before the game itself even started... or well, the games tutorial started. at this point I was already considering whether this was worth it, since this lowered every expectation I already had... I mean how can I be expected to remember all this stuff with no way of getting it explained again unless I have to break the pace of the game, minimize it and google stuff? So getting to moving around... barely, every time I move what seems no more then 10 meters, there's a new pop-up giving me another ""this is important, you do it like this, which will affect the world you play in"" generic message. Cool choices matter, I get that by now. So (extremely) slowly and with a ton of pauses because of explanations, I FINALLY get to the combat section of the tutorial. And what do I get... never before have I had to read that much to understand a combat system. I could go on about the wall of text new players are met with. After finnishing reading more stuff about this minor obscure detail in combat, I get to the actual thing... It's worse than Skyrims system. Extremely clunky, free-targeting-city unless you choose one specific target... which somehow always ends up in the back ranks so you might as well retarget, and suddenly, that target is in the back ranks... oh my lord. At this point I'm about ready to give up, Heavily discouraged by what feels like The Shakespere Collection in text, that has to be read and understood, and utter stupidity in combat systems. But I press on becuase there has to be some light at the end of this tunnel. Welcome to the actual game itself. Now please have en eternaty of go-here-do-this quests with absoultly no diversity. And if you wanna defeat this foe you've never seen before... guess what, you have to break the pace of the game, stop combat and read even more about how to even damage a Noonwraith. So at an all-time low in-game, I decide to try to get some more exp so I can be at least somewhat useful... Oh wait, let's pause the game becuase, during the tutorial we didn't make you read about skill points, brewing potions or weapon durability. Just great... After actually giving up on reading and just wanting to mess around, I slam my space button and just skip it, deciding to figure it out at some point when I really need it. So finally leaving the starting... town? I suddenly encounter an enemy that's no more then TWO WHOLE LEVELS above me... and suddenly all of my attacks are reduced by 90% in damage... Are you actually for real?... Fine whatever... I'll flee and come back later... but oh wait, your health is low and you can only heal by eating food which is horrendously slow... Now please be attacked by 8 Drowners at the same time, which all stun you and kills you... and btw you didn't save so please redo all your missions. I finally just gave up and closed the game. So what did I learn. - Unless you're willing to come out of the game with a PHD in Witcher stuff, don't open it up. - Whatever you try to do, assume you have to read about it in some random book, stupid pop-up or your journal. - Combat is insanely clunky, even if you side roll enemies still hit you and you lose 1/3 of your HP from lesser monsters... You never ever have the chance to counter attack because of sheer numbers disadvantage... And why do I have to choose between 2 different swords to even damage propperly (This should be something that comes naturally... not something a player should activly choose) - Story is very unimmersive and flat. at least the tiny bits I got to ""experience"" (Seriously, just 2 edge-lrods in some tavern) - There are so many systems that are so extremely confusing to new players, that they don't even bother learning them - The leaning curve in this game just requires you to be a working at NASA. - Unless you can connect a controller, the game is insufferable with mouse and keyboard. - The game, AT LEAST, uses a nice color palette. - Total playtime: 5.5 hours.",1,2020-02-16,PC,user

UserReviewsLUL,The best game of this generation and possibly the best game ever made. The story is absolutely amazing. You can play it without having played the first one but if you did play Witcher 2 then you will end up appreciating it even more after you had finished Witcher 3. The game feels really good to play. The animations and physics are the best I have seen. The graphics are only rivaled by a few other games like Detroit: Become Human and God of War.,10,2020-02-15,PC,user

nysailorscout,"This game was incredibly overrated. Let me go over the problems: COMBAT & CONTROLS (-): The combat is like a bad version of Bloodborne. The controls are as stiff as a board and the targeting is unsatisfying. Most of the game can be handled by throwing up a magic shield sign (Quen) and mashing the regular attack button. There will be times where you are unable to pick up an object without simultaneously using your ""look"" camera functionality and movement because you cannot do something as simple as face in a particular direction. WEAPON/EQUIPMENT VARIETY (-): There is only 1 primary weapon type for the entire game, which is outrageous for an RPG! Games from the 80's had more variety. In a single-player solo RPG, there needs to be more variety or it just becomes an adventure with tacked-on stats. MAGIC (-): The magic system is very clunky to use in combat, along with being too basic. This discourages people from making non-melee builds. NPCs (-): Most of the NPCs are ugly on purpose and usually dull. Some of the facial animations are frightening. VOICE ACTING (-): The English voice acting of Geralt is a forced low voice, so it is guttural at the expense of color and emotion. They could have just hired somebody that naturally has a low voice and we could have been treated to a more fully-developed Geralt. WRITING (+): This is a good point. The writers took time to flesh out characters, particularly Geralt. He is not a blank cipher. He has his own hopes and fears and complicated motivations. I wish more games would have writing like this! GRAPHICS (+): This is another good point. The special effects (like sunlight and riding) are excellent and it makes the world feel real. Yennefer is beautiful in a way that I never thought possible for a computer-generated image. She crosses over the uncanny valley. In short, The Witcher 3 would have been great as an adventure or movie! But as an RPG with poor combat, clunky controls, boring weapon/magic and shallow character customization and levelling, it is just not a game that I would recommend.",2,2020-02-10,PC,user
Refraction,"This game is overrated! Is probably what your thoughts will be as a person who straight jumped into the 3rd witcher game, it’s a massive game, and your opinion about it would count after at least 30 hours which is almost the time to play a new game, those who feel overwhelmed by it and found it tedious will probably not wait for ~30 hours to decide. Which is unfortunate, as its only after about 30 hours that this game progresses from something that is tedious/slow/overwhelming to come show itself to be one of the most polished deep video games that's been made to date. And when I say deep I don’t meant it to be very abstract in its writing, or bombarding the player with themes and theories that they couldn’t have up with, in fact there is nothing very deep or unexpected in it. What it has however is a sense of scale that is unsurpassed in any video game I've ever played.",10,2020-02-09,PC,user

I have around 90 hours in so far and still haven't completed the base game, let alone the 2 expansions. The world is beautiful and the gamplay crisp.

Mortmawt,"Amazing game ahead, therefore try buy and then hurrah for fun! I found the first Witcher game to be incredibly boring and couldn't even force myself to finish the game. Then I played The Witcher 2 and I really think it was a below average game. The Witcher 3 is waaay much more fun to play and they fixed a lot of the things I disliked about the other two games. Unlike The Witcher 2, the game is well balanced and while combat isn't really anything spectacular it has been improved and is enjoyable now. My favorite thing about the game is how there are a lot of choices you can make that will impact the story. There are some few stuff that are noticeably bad. 1. The very first thing I noticed that was bad about the game was character movement. It's just sluggish. You get used to it once you get into the game tho. 2. The horse gets stuck by anything small he touches. So annoying. 3. The game honestly feels more of a movie sometimes than an actual game as you will be watching cinematics more than playing the game. Overall, great game! Highly recommended. :]",8,2020-02-05,PC,user

Why isn't there a search field, at least for PC? - The utility of the hundreds of items is hard to tell... there are so many recipes and items, and you don't know what to sell, what to craft... the item system is... a bit too much... this with the fact of being overburdened is annoying.

Yulian,"One could say we're talking about a masterpiece. An outstanding and highly recommended work by CD Projekt, not only for those who likes the genre but for everyone I must say. A game that assembles a great and dramatic history with a gorgeous world, filled with life and epicness created by the graphics and the soundtrack. It has its flaws, but are the strengths it has that makes it a great experience. I started with average expectations and found myself playing for more than 1000 hours in a few weeks. *Graphics: 8 *Story: 10 *Playability: 7 *Content: 9 *Technical Aspect (PC): 7 *Graphics: 8 Keeping in mind it's from 2015, it has a very good graphic quality. The design of the world and its wonderful landscapes and cinematics makes a full experience, worthy of screenshots. Plus, the characters desing is remarkable as well as the animations. *Story: 10 Simply great. Also, interesting characters, well crafted missions and desicions that will affect the game directly but also the ending in different ways. It will never feel boring. *Playability: 7 The combat is pretty good, although it's rather simple and doesn't feel so polished sometimes. It improves with the signals, potions and bombs mechanics. The horse movements when you're in control aren't great, it feels dumb sometimes as you have to do weird moves to avoid clash with things or getting stuck in places. Also, playing with mouse and keyboard can be frustrating at first mainly because of the keybindings. *Content: 9 It has a lot of hours of playing. The map is huge and the side quests are really interesting doesn't feel generic and repetivie as they have and unique story to offer. The witcher contracts are pretty good and you have treasures throughout the map to find. Also we have the Gwynt minigame which is really fun and you can also the fact that you can improve your deck by beating other players. Maybe one thing I'd like it's the fact you could interact in a more believable way to the NPC's. *Technical Aspect (PC): 7 It's well optimized and pretty solid overall, but there are bugs and some problems with the controls sometimes.",9,2020-01-27,PC,user

Patroneq,"It's the best RPG in the market definitely. The characters are well written, highly developed and I remember all of the major characters even 4 years after playing it. It means, that they were memorable. Not all of them I liked, there were the ones I really hated, but the characters are definitely the strongest point in The Witcher. The plot and the side quests are equally superior to other side activities in different games. The world is massive, full of content, beautiful (but at the same time really harsh and sad). The gameplay is the worst part of this game, but it's still decent (8/10 i'd say), becoming a little repetitive and boring after many hours. But the rest is awesome! 10/10, the best game of the decade.",10,2020-01-21,PC,user
Prometheus1241,"Well, i think it is hard not to hear about Witcher 3 if you are a gamer. The final part of the trilogy brings a lot of emotions. It has good story( not the best, because it is particularly stupid, as for me) good dialogues and characters, awesome design and graphics. Of course, it has disadvantages, like the fighting system, but you simply ignore it when you start the game.",10,2020-01-19,PC,user

Poochingus,"Finally had a PC powerful enough to play modern games, and this was sitting in my list of purchases for years! I bought it just to support CD Projekt Red for their ethical practices in the industry. What I found was a game where I realized very soon, that I would have done myself a favor playing the first two games. Many characters, locations, and history were all painfully learned about through exposition that I swallowed at times(yes, you can skip such dialogue chains) or I'd get so fatigued that I eventually found myself spamming the space bar to skip the talking in quests, hoping to get to the playing. If you think you'd like the game, either read the books, or play from the first game to get the story. Still I enjoyed the world building, and the characters, all of whom are flawed, and have you loving them one second, hating them another. Like all open world RPGs though, it is wide as an ocean, and deep as a puddle. While the enemy variety is actually respectable unlike games such as Zelda Breath of the wild, it is still just not enough for how big the game is. This is mitigated somewhat by diversions in plot and characters breaking up the action. Minimal puzzle solving, less than skyrim, but never anything repetitive. Combat is odd here. The potions are a vital and interesting part of the game. However it sadly is hard to get a variety that will serve you well unless you complete many many many side quests, and even then, if you unwittingly make the wrong choice, can miss ingredients forever. That is what baffles here, as well as needing diagrams for each potion and each upgrade for the oils which power up your swords against different enemies. It can feel annoying not knowing if you have all the recipes yet or if there are more. Still, once created and used, these potions are one of the best ways to overcome an enemy and it is satisfying and fun to use them. Combat in general though, is pretty basic. Strong attack, fast attack exist. You can dodge toward and away, but also sidestep. You can also do a parry, which doesn't work on all enemies, but is the only way to actually kill anyone with a shield which is annoying. Ranged is almost non-existent. It is clunky to use, and you just have a crossbow, and bolts are rarely looted. Magic is fun, but annoying because you have to pull up a quick menu to swap spells because you have only 1 spell **** game really wants you to use melee combat, and it isn't really all that in depth or exciting sadly. Still, no matter the style you choose, you will always use a combo of spells, potions and melee combat because they are all, always helpful. The upgrades are a bit limiting, which is a shame because of how much more fun I think could be had. Putting points into upgrades does not activate them, you have limited slots to active unlocked perks. Strangely the game punishes mixing combat styles via mutagens. Every 3 unlock spots can be paired with a colored mutagen, that corresponds to one type of upgrade. There are 4 types of upgrades. red upgrades are direct combat related, swinging your sword. Blue is for the game's magic called ""signs"". Green is for getting more use out of potions. Fourth is colorless, and general, while more powerful, they don't combo with the colored upgrades. If you have 1 green mutagen, let us say, it gives you 100hp extra. But pair it with one green ability and you get 200hp extra, 2 green abilities, now its 400, and 3 nets you 600 extra. Now you see why it punishes mixing. To really get the most, you will want to most likely stick with one niche, at least making 3 of your 4 mutagen slots one color. Thankfully there is a potion you can buy which resets all your skill investments incase you want to try something different or you goofed up early on. Sadly the game is almost bethesda levels of glitchy. Many graphical, but lots of crashes that force a PC reboot, some where I have gotten stuck of geometry, and at times enemies who freeze up and let me kill them. Thankfully nothing locks you out of quest lines or anything else vital. The story is fun, lots of dialogue and good voice over work, even for the nothing little side quests! However I feel like once the game reaches its climax, it goes on for far too long afterwards. I thought I reached the end but did not, and it felt wrong, and I lacked motivation to continue playing. The end felt rushed, or at least I felt rushed by the game, as my choices no longer seemed to matter, they forced me down one path. This is my ultimate gripe with RPGs of this type. I want you to either spoonfeed me a story and let me relax and enjoy it, or respect my choices enough to let things happen! Overall I had fun. But like all open world games, I want less space, fewer fluff quests, and more quality. Thankfully I can say the game was pretty high quality, I found myself listening in on NPC banter and would wait till they finished. A rushed product, but solid.",8,2020-01-04,PC,user
My0neS,"Best game of the last 10 years. The combat system of The Witcher 3 is very fluently and difficult. This difficulty makes the game more fun. The story side is legend.

FallenStar,"A titan in the gaming industry, Witcher 3 sets a bar just like Skyrim did years ago. Storytelling, voice acting, combat, the world itself, quests, everything is crafted so well and you can feel the love and dedication that went to every little thing you can do in the game. The game shines in the sense of scale and adventure like no other. While you cannot create your own character, you quickly get attached and adjusted to the character of Geralt right from the very beginning. No other game gripped me as quickly as this one did with a fantastic opening scene and tutorial. Music and graphics blends in perfectly with the world setting. The way each cutscene and dialogue is shot is great, the wind, the atmosphere and ambience give make you forget you're playing a video game for a moment. Each place you travell has an identity of its own. Skillige, in particular, is breathtaking both visually and music-wise. Velen feels crushed as death keeps spreading while Novigrad feels like an alternative version of King's Landing from Game of Thrones. The choices in the game actually matter even in small quests, you banter for more money, you unravel secrets, exploration always pays off, armour sets look great especially the Witcher Gear that you have to work for in order to obtain. Each armour set belongs and feels a part of this world. The swords and the elements go along nicely as well. There's plenty of enemy variety with monsters and humans to fight against. The experience of the game can be vastly improved if you decide to play on a higher difficulty even as a first-timer due to the fact that you'll be required to use every combat system element out there including potions, runes and oils for your swords. Gwent is a great mini-game included in the game ( a card game) that will add up to the things you can do, that on its own deserves its own credit but since it's a part of the entire game, it just adds up to the score. Obviously it's not perfect and by the end of the game, you can pretty much overpower every other character in the game. The expansions Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine offer over 60 hours of gameplay on top of the base game that can take up to roughly around 15-20 hours if you follow the main plot only and over 40-50 hours if you decide to explore a little bit and do some side stuff (which you will inevitably do) While the game is truly great the game falters a bit in its detail on what you can do outside of combat. While exploration and investigation are great, I wish they would add details such as sitting animation, meditation, drinking, eating; things like this that would simply feel amazing in this universe. All in all The Witcher 3 is a true masterpiece that accomplished, perhaps one of the greatest feats ever both as a game and the way it was handled by the developers (free DLC; decent prices, etc.) Triple A companies have a lot to learn from this. Positives: + Great Story + Great Characters + Memorable Game overall + Beautiful graphics + Splendid voice acting + Great combat at higher difficulty levels taking all the potions/oils/etc taken into account + Decisions matter and can heavily impact the endings of the game + Each region you get to explore is great, memorable, distinct bringing its own dangers and perils with many good things as well + Legendary music for every area + Cool boss fights whenever you get caught in one + Splendid side quests that are memorable, mysterious, gruesome or funny + Ambience, atmosphere is a 10/10 + Exploration pays off + Good skill tree that can change up the combat and the way you play + Gwent minigame + Easy over 100 hours of awesomeness with the Game of the Year Edition Negatives: - Lack of details in Geralt's actions outside of combat (can't sit, no animation for eating, drinking, meditation. In a tavern, those would be great - No fishing - Gwent is rather unbalanced after 20 hours in the game (if you obtain some strong cards and add to your deck) - Weapons can break, that's ok but sometimes it happens too fast and their repairs seem rather boring without an animation. Feels a bit unfinished - Some weapons get left behind in level after acquiring them, a shame you can't upgrade their level to your character - Combat can become stale unless you upgrade your skill tree for more abilities",10,2019-12-31,PC,user
samuk190,"after looking in the negative reviews I was forced to write this review, how pathetic people can be to downvoting such a beautiful, immersive, detailed, game? Yes its true that the combat was made for playing with controller(so console). But it is innovative, is not only hack and slash thing, you have magic and you have two types of sword. When you compare to other games the witcher 3 was surely the most well made game ever, the insanity of work that CD PROJEKT has put in this game is insane.. in RPG category is by far the best game I've played. Why? Well, a RPG must have some elements like -> ambient, music, story.. and Witcher 3 have all of these. Another w0w thing is that they released two expansions for this game and both are insanely 10/10.. This game is not only about fun, but about morals, politics, and showing the good and bad side of the life even if you think its just a game.. IT show how much a decision is important.. This game can make you angry about some aspects, happy about others.. Also the protagonist doesnt feel like a protagonist, it feels like you're doing this, geralt is very neutral so it is very adaptative to any gameplay you do.",10,2019-12-30,PC,user

At first I have tried to make a detail review on this game. But than I've find out that all my characteristics will be too flat to describe anything about it.

Yuwajin,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a serene, contemplative, brilliant adventure. The amount of quality characters, settings, and monsters is enough to make me believe this is the work of hundreds of thousands of people. What CD Projekt Red has done here, is something so many studios aspire to do; create a beautiful, believable, and enjoyable world full of art and charm. What usually happens with games that are this ambitious is fragmentation. Too many teams without the right direction or collaboration can make you feel like you're playing 5 different games put into one. When one team wants to create gameplay that is best enjoyed in an open world setting that is satisfying and has great animations, but the other team wants to tell a linear narrative, even for a single quest, it creates a disconnect. This game does the opposite. It ties in the gorgeous art and stories told in the past, and incorporates that into the stories they tell in the present and future. The act of preparation, research, and combat with the monsters is all rooted in what it means to be a Witcher. The people that mean something to Geralt, begin to mean something to you. The music ties into everything you do and feel in a way that can only be described as near-perfect. From the feeling of rowing a boat through the fjords of Skellige, to fighting a drowner in Velen bog, the music always seems to be there right when you need it. The only exceptions can happen when you're in a quiet part of the game, do something to level up, and proceed to be bombarded by some unexpected, but still appreciated vocal ""AYYYYYY""s. The character and dialogue writing and performance is something to behold. Every accent, and quirk, is lifelike. The way each individual ties into their surrounding community, stories, and quests is just how it should be. And the writing and design of what you do on quests, either to progress the main narrative, or just to pass the time, is handled with such care and reference to the rest of the game. In closing, this game does everything it needed to and more. It sets the bar for love, care, and collaboration for different aspects of what games are and can be. Every swing of your sword, strum of a lute by Dandelion, stench of a reeking Striga, and look of admiration from Ciri or Yennefer fills my heart. I love this game and studio more than almost any other for all the things they do, and I think you will too.",10,2019-12-27,PC,user
Somewhat,"After disappointing Netflix series, it feels just right to go back and review this wonderful game. The writing is superb - Witcher 3 deals with complex themes, exploring dark corners of human nature - the world is torn apart by war and poverty, which brings out the worst in many people, yet it fortifying decency, compassion and valor in others. World's bleak and dark - but at the same time it's colorful and hopeful. Game jumps form cruelty to compassion, from treachery to heroism and from tragedy to comedy in a one continuous flow. What fascinates me the most is the absolute lack of pretense and nihilism, that is so easy to succumb to when dealing with thoughtful topics. Nothing feels fake, everything is as sincere as it gets. Visually, game is stunning - graphics are outstanding, even almost five years later, every area has it's unique style and atmosphere, even the darkest and most depressing parts of the in-game world have some charm and magnetism to them. Soundtrack is gorgeous as well, capturing and reinforcing the spirit of every scene, from blood-pumping ""Hunt or be Hunted"" and ""Steel for humans"" to heartwarming ""Fields of Ard Skellig"", it never feels out of place. Combat can be a bit jarring for some people, but once you've got into the rhythm of it, it starts flowing like a river. And once you put enough skillpoints in basically anything, you'll start to realize that there is more depth to it, than just hitting and dodging. Open-world is fun to explore, with tons of interesting and engaging side-quests, both big and small. It tempts me to say, that characters are what really steals the show. It's not hard to understand why, Geralt, his friends and loved ones, as well as his enemies, are all written, acted, modeled and animated on the insanely high level. Practically everyone, from peasants and common grunts to kings and high sorceresses, act like living people, with flaws and strengths, passions, dreams and fears. It's actual human drama and emotion, that turns simple ""go in the woods and kill some wolves"" into a little touching story about love and loss. People are at the core of everything in this game, the driving force that keeps you going on and asking for more. And yet, I cannot say, that it's only one thing, that makes this game. Writers, designers, voice actors, artist, coders, directors, composers, etc. - everyone put their heart and soul into this project. If a massive game with hundreds of people in credits can be a work of passion, then it's definitely a case here. ""Masterpiece"" have become a buzzword recently - people like to call decent-but-not-so-great project this way, whether games or movies, so it kinda lost a lot of it's weight. And on the other hand we have rather pedantic people, who are pointing out, that something can't be called a masterpiece if it has flaws. It is true, that Witcher 3 isn't prefect - there are some bugs here and there, even after the patches and movement can be clunky on gamepad (much more fluid on keyboard+mouse, btw). Also some people can be discouraged by the size of the game. While it's all factually correct, it's not nearly enough to bring down the positives. This game is truly greater than the sum of its parts. It's greater than many movies I've seen, books I've read and, most certainly, games I've played. This is truly a work of art. I wish I could be more articulate to express all the positive emotions I have towards this, but it's better not to - this is the case, when you should experience it by yourself. After all, interactivity is what defines gaming.",10,2019-12-27,PC,user

Also if we compare with other RPG games, this one have a very bad shaped Leveling/Experience design. Even they didn't care to fix their mistake over these years. If need risk and rewards, playing easiest or hard doesn't matter because nothing is rewarding you. So, playing easiest will be best option but don't expect it as easiest difficulty.

MichaelVickDog,"The combat is terrible, dodges can be spammed to effectively never be hit, sword range is atrocious, the end of your blade's hit box is about a foot shorter than your blade, and in general the combat is neither fun nor rewarding. The story is incredibly shallow and boring, which is to be expected out of such a simple premise for a story. A contributing part to the boredom is how long it takes to get into the meat of the game, 15 hours isn't enough to even begin to have fun with the story. Even the characters are boring, a prime example being Geralt. Geralt's personality revolves solely around having a cool voice and being sarcastic in the same manner as a middle schooler. I believe Geralt represents what CD Projekt Red storyboard developers wish they were, and in this manner, his character is incredibly shallow. The UI is atrocious, way too many redundant menus, and interacting with them is incredibly janky and just detracts from an already non-user-friendly game. The controls, just like the UI, are awful. The general lack of maneuverability is showcased by the input lag involved with moving that makes any amount of walking a chore. But hey, at least the graphics look nice!",2,2019-12-24,PC,user

YulianD,"One could say we're talking about a masterpiece. An outstanding and highly recommended work by CD Projekt, not only for those who likes the genre but for everyone I must say. A game that assembles a great and dramatic history with a gorgeous world, filled with life and epicness created by the graphics and the soundtrack. It has its flaws, but are the strengths it has that makes it a great experience. I started with average expectations and found myself playing for more than 1000 hours in a few weeks. *Graphics: 8 *Story: 10 *Playability: 7 *Content: 9 *Technical Aspect (PC): 8 *Graphics: 8 Keeping in mind it's from 2015, it has a very good graphic quality. The design of the world and its wonderful landscapes and cinematics makes a full experience, worthy of screenshots. Plus, the characters desing is remarkable as well as the animations. *Story: 10 Simply great. Also, interesting characters, well crafted missions and desicions that will affect the game directly but also the ending in different ways. It will never feel boring. *Playability: 7 The combat is pretty good, although it's rather simple and doesn't feel so polished sometimes. It improves with the signals, potions and bombs mechanics. The horse movements when you're in control aren't great, it feels dumb sometimes as you have to do weird moves to avoid clash with things or getting stuck in places. Also, playing with mouse and keyboard can be frustrating at first mainly because of the keybindings. *Content: 9 It has a lot of hours of playing. The map is huge and the side quests are really interesting doesn't feel generic and repetivie as they have and unique story to offer. The witcher contracts are pretty good and you have treasures throughout the map to find. Also we have the Gwynt minigame which is really fun and you can also the fact that you can improve your deck by beating other players. Maybe one thing I'd like it's the fact you could interact in a more believable way to the NPC's. *Technical Aspect (PC): 8 It's well optimized and pretty solid overall, but there are bugs and some problems with the controls sometimes.",9,2019-12-20,PC,user
pdcmoreira,"This is the best game I've ever played. Absolutely perfect in gameplay, graphics, sound, voice acting, story and replayability. I don't see how could anyone dislike the game, unless they simply don't like the genre. The amount of attention to detail you can find in every remote corner of the world is absurd. Every single character, even the most irrelevant one, has an amazing voice acting! The soundtrack is phenomenal and comes with the game in both FLAC and mp3. I bought this game in the past month for 15€ with both expansions, but it could easily cost 150€ and it would still be too cheap. You can spend more than 300 hours on a single playthrough of this game (with both expansions) and you will want to start over in New Game + and Death March difficulty for a completely different challenge, with another ability and gear build and a different path in the storyline (even in the side quests). The only negative I can think of is the occasional bug here and there that may be a bit annoying for 2 seconds, but even then, this is one of the most bug-free games I've played in recent years.

DravisKyle,"You know this game by now, and how great it is. The Witcher 3, it's no doubt one of the best game almost anyone can play. Maybe even your average COD & FIFA Fans, can play this and enjoy it. RPG is not for all, just like an adventure game, but for those that like these genres, then this is your holy grail. Only thing I did not like, was how hard it is to level up, monsters and enemies gives you low XP, the higher your level is compared to them. (Example if you are level 10, and you beat a level 5 monster, he will yield very low xp, and will become lower and lower the highest your level become). Other than that, 9/10 for me.",9,2019-11-25,PC,user

abasit2399,"The game I've always dreamed to play. The game with extensive content and realms filled with live ambience. The game that enlightened my mind, and enhanced my gaming experience. The mere existance in the world of witcher has it's lore. The world is exquisitely designed and fashioned to meet the best gaming standards. The game features the story of a protagnist named Gerald of Rivia. Butcher of Blaviken, who is the main character and the game is set to Role-play Gereld. The game is intricately designed and houses both monsters, and humans. The cultural diversity, the development of each individual character. This is the achievement of Witcher that lures players to explore the world and make decisions to fashion the world around them. The credibility of the decisions makes the character development as a whole and the impactful choices make the world flexible. Currently these are my thought on the best game I've yet and I'm certain to explore the game more.",10,2019-11-23,PC,user

AndreAlexandr,"A true masterpiece yet to be beated! You don't need to have played the previous games or even knew the book series from the polish writer Andrzej Sapkowzki to enjoy it, but if you want, it will help adding more flavour the amazing things you'll live in the skin of this monster slayer. ""The Witcher 3"" really make you feel like some of your actions has consequences, being it completing a quest and refusing the bounty or simply failing it on purpose; you always need to consider the lesser evil and this fact put the characters in a much more human position than any other game where you just can be a hero f***ing the people's life with your good actions or a villain that end up saving the day by consequence. Theres TONS of stuff to spend hours adventuring in the game. Contracts to complete, monsters to hunt, schemes to dismantle, treasures to find and so on... It's possible to spend hours just traveling to finish one quest and discover a dozen more in the way you took - and another dozen in the other route you could take. The best part is that lots of these side quests was so well written and executed that you may think they are part of the main quest. Never keep boring be fulling around and track everything in this game if you are in for a great story and not for free fancy action, slashing and shooting all the time. PS: Gwent is like another game inside this game! A clever way to forget a bit the harsh life of hunt ghouls and **** trying to beat that drunk moron in the crossroads to receive his unique card (so that you need to take care to not start hunting all Gwent cards and left your witcher obligations aside sometimes).",10,2019-11-14,PC,user

LoneWolf912,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt es el mas reciente titulo AAA de la saga de the witcher desarrollado por cd projekt red, en el encarnaremos una vez mas a geralt de rivia en su busqueda por su hija ciri para asi salvarla de la caceria salvaje la cual tiene unos planes nada buenos para ella HISTORIA tras mis 130 horas en the witcher 3: wild hunt solo tengo que decir ¡valla historia tan buena! la historia llega a ser muy emocional y epica, que no quieres despegarte de tu asiento, la historia puede al principio parecer un poco abrumadora por toda la cantidad de personajes, situaciones y misiones secundarias pero conforme pases misiones y te empapes en la historia y lore del juego te la estaras pasando muy bien y ya no te parecera tan abrumador. y hablando de las misiones secundarias ¡son muy buenas! a diferencia de juegos como los de ubisoft que parecen que las misiones secundarias son para rellenar, aqui no es asi, las misiones secundarias estan perfectamente complementadas con la historia principal y el mundo de the witcher, e incluso muchas misiones secundarias son mejores que las principales, JUGABILIDAD el combate al principio puede parecer un poco tosco y lento pero una vez acostumbrandote ya no se dificultara mucho, como en dark souls, te sentiras como verdadero espadachin con los ataques rapidos y letales, pero tampoco puedes andar dando espadasos a lo bestia por que los ataques de los enemigos aveces llegan a ser muy letales lo cual tendras que contratacar y esquivar para que no te maten la parte de la magia y el arbol de habilidades es mi parte favorita del juego por que con forme vallas subiendo de nivel obtendras puntos de habilidad con los cuales puedes gastarlos por diferentes habilidades de combate y de magia que te haran sentirte como un dios cuando luches contra los enemigos en especial la magia, cuentas con diferentes señales que son AARD que es una descarga de energia que provocara que tus enemigos salgan disparados, IGNI es una descarga de fuego la cual puede ser dirigida,YRDEN es una trampa magica, QUEN es un escudo y con AXIA puedes controlar la mente de los enemigos GRAFICOS Y TECNICO el apartado grafico de the witcher 3 es impresionante, tiene unas texturas muy buenas, la iluminacion esta muy bien la cantidad de vegetacion que hay por todo el mapa te hace creer que de verdad estas en la edad media con todo y castillos y casas derrumbadas, la optimizacion del juego es muy buena ya que con todos esos elementos en pantalla y ademas con texturas de buena calidad, el juego va como la seda sin bajones de frames CONCLUSION The witcher 3 ha sido un muy gran videojuego, de los mejores de la generacion y un modelo a seguir que futuros rpgs tomaran como inspiracion, personalmente se ha convertido en uno de mis juegos favoritos y que me hiciera fan del trabajo de cd projekt red, si te gustan los juegos rpg y de accion o juegos con ambientacion medieval y con muy buena historia, pues the witcher 3 es casi compra obligatoria y en mi opinion se lo recomiendo a todo el mundo",9,2019-11-13,PC,user

Most quests are interesting, have good dialogue, and have phenomenal character building. The abilities are enjoyable and interesting. Lot's of ways you can go with different skills and mutagens, etc. There are a couple cons that stick out though. Controlling Geralt, especially in action, is clunky. You get used to the timing of button presses and the rhythm comes quite easily after a bit of time, but it's still slow. Second, some of the quests certainly drag on a little too far.

Xevon,"I suppose we should start by getting the bad stuff out of the way first. Some of the plots could be more engaging than they are. The gameplay, while good, isn't perfect. The game has a few superficial bugs. Some areas in the game, Velen comes to mind, are largely unappealing if immersive and full of things to do. Roach (your horse) can be a pain in the ass to manoeuvre. As for the good? Literally everything else. Graphically it's fantastic and holds up four and a half years on, runs good too. The voice acting is top notch. The story writing is without a doubt some of the finest in a video game in recent memory, with several plots (The Bloody Baron, Hearts of Stone, etc) standing out as some of the best video game writing I've experienced in many years. The game comes packed to the gills with an incredible wealth of content, it would take a good 120 - 130 hours at my estimation to have done everything (counting the games expansion packs of course). No microtransactions, no loot boxes, no tacked on multiplayer, no always online, absolutely no **** - just 2 expansion packs which are arguably worth vastly more than their ticket price, especially Blood and Wine which expands upon and adds so much you might as well be playing The Witcher 4. Now, the game can take a while to get moving. It's a slow burn that can start off feeling tedious at first, but keep with it and it will reward your time immensely. Oh, and do get the Game of the Year version or the expansion passes - they're worth every cent and maybe even more. Hearts of Stone introduces new content and mechanics in the Velen region as well as a 10 hour story which is one the best in the game. Blood and Wine is more like 30 hours, give you a large new area which also happens to be arguably the best and prettiest area in the game, expands upon the gameplay and mechanics considerably and has a great plot to boot. My final rating would be 9.5, but we'll round it up to 10 for the sake of Metacritic. A genre defining must play of the highest order. Emphatically recommended.",10,2019-10-28,PC,user

robomartion,"Dull story, borderline amateurish writing and voice acting, this is quite clearly a game made by Eastern Europeans and not in a good way. The Witcher 3 is lowbrow and unrefined like a blunt instrument made by someone who believes they know what they are doing but in reality is far from qualified. If it weren't enough that the games writing and characters are out of some odd fan fiction, the dialogue moves slowly and lacks choice, character control is oddly primitive, combat like an arcadey, spammy hack and slash, the skill system bloated and unnecessary and the environments are boring and samey, not invoking the slightest bit of curiosity or wonder and the much touted feature - the graphics - are technically strong, testament to the quality of the asset libraries they are from, but somehow hard to look at, suffering from poor, or perhaps no creative direction. I could perhaps forgive the game for some of these problems if had at least one redeeming quality but there are none.. even the menus are an unwieldy mess. It is a travesty and telling of the gaming community as a whole that games like the Witcher 3 receive unhindered praise with its glaring and fundamental problems unnoticed.",2,2019-10-22,PC,user
AM0N,"One of, if not the, best single player games made. Ever. One of the most vivid universes ever -- vast swamps, big cities, small villages, mountains. The Witcher 3 covers every base in terms of environment. These environments are furthered by amazing theme music all through out the game. Questing/contracts have different conclusions depending on your decisions, and the amount of quests are basically endless. Combat mechanics are nice when you get used to them, and character build can vary greatly -- all of these things leads to amazing replay-ability (not to mention all of the different endings). Dumped about 80-90 hours in to the game, and I've probably explored 10% of the game in terms of total content. Both DLC's are amazing, and distinctly unique from one another.",10,2019-10-20,PC,user

Также хочу отметить, что в игре очень хорошо подчеркивается возрастное ограничение, и это не только из-за нецензурных выражений, сцен насилия и сексуального контента, но и из-за качества перевода, благодаря которому ты просто максимально прочувствуешь и вживешься во взрослую жизнь людей тех далеких времен.

UnAVA,"While the spectacular world and the beautiful backstory surrounding the characters will awe you, the main story unfortunately comes extremely short and below average quality of typical RPGs. There is a clear effort put into the sidequests of the game but the main journey that the characters take feel quite forced and limited due to the nature of the game needing to finish the Wild Hunt arc of the story in one game. The controls of the main character feels extremely stiff due to wanting to emphasize the stylish nature of combat Geralt takes. This is especially bothersome when the character is forced to take 2m forward for most attacks you initiate. Looting in the game is not spectacular but understandable considering the game was never focused on looting in the first place. However, it also feels the inclusion of the system itself is pointless considering food is unnecessary and any potions you unlocked do not require further crafting to refill. Although this expansion is a significant upgrade to the main game, ultimately feels on par with the main game because of the previous issues that persist. This is the best Witcher game so far, while it does fall short in terms of quests than Witcher 1. A little less hand holding will be welcome, and the detective quests felt extremely dissatisfying when you just click on shiny red objects and Geralt does all the work. Seems like an extremely wasted potential considering there are dialogue options in the game. The combat does feel better than Witcher 1&2 but there is still much room to improve.",8,2019-09-23,PC,user

Fliff,"I'm not really sure how this game came to be praised so highly. It's a severe case of story over gameplay. The combat is repetitive and incredibly simple, and only barely evolves as you progress through the game. The only two things I can recommend this game for are the visuals and the story, which are both very well done for the most part. Geralt can get a bit one-note at times with his whole gruff demeanor, but there is some good characterization throughout. The visuals are stellar, but the controls are abysmal and the animation during gameplay is janky at best. So again, the story and maybe the visuals are why you should play this game. Beyond that there is very little depth to gameplay, the loot system is worthless, and the world is basically lifeless if you stare at it for more than 10 seconds and realize 99% of the people you come across are essentially just window dressing. TES has many, many faults, but I think Witcher shows me why TES is so well done. The world feels alive in TES, each NPC has a path and purpose, and the world genuinely feels alive, not just in cutscenes but everywhere the player goes. The world of Witcher 3 feels lifeless in comparison, it's all just there for you and the handful of NPCs who can actually give you a quest or play Gwent with you.",5,2019-09-21,PC,user

UltiDK,"The Witcher 3 is an amazing game, and truly a masterpiece. The main story is about you taking the role as the witcher Geralt of Rivia, which this time is lead on a quest to find his adoptive daugther, Ciri, before the infamous, and very dangerous The Wild Hunt does. The many characters you meet throughout the main story are all interesting, with their own backstories, personalities, motivations and so on. The dialogue choices leads to many different outcomes, just like in other good RPGs. The story is very long with an average length of 50 hours, but it doesn't feel slow paced at any point, and remains interesting all the way through. The big open world of The Witcher 3 is very beautiful, with a big diversity in areas, and travelling the world is very satisfying. The many side quests which you will encounter are often as good as the main quests, something you rarily see in a game. In terms of gameplay, there's many options. The combat system offers many different ways to tackle the fights against enemies, however, there's just something about the combat that feels a bit unsatisfying. I also encountered a glitch were I couldn't attack, which was quite irritating, but luckily, it only happened rarily. The horse riding also feels a bit bad, and the movement of Geralt can sometimes feel a bit weird, but you'll get used to it. The game also includes the options to play the card game Gwent against some of the many NPCs. I personally found Gwent to be very fun, and often spent a lot of time just travelling from town to town, looking for new cards and opponents. Even though The Witcher 3 has some flaws, it's story and world is so fantastic that the game deserves nothing below a 9/10.",9,2019-09-21,PC,user

The story is amazing, Every character is very well written- from the main characters all the way down to the side-quest characters. Even the unimportant NPC's at the side can bring something unique. The maps are enormous! In my eyes, Velen has the most unique atmosphere, music and quests. The strange underbelly sense when I entered Crookback bog. The ""A towerful of Mice"" quest also left quite an impact and where you had to think well of your choices. It was great! The gameplay is nice, and I'd say that you have to think before you hunt down certain monsters. The harder the difficulty, how more important the preparations.

To the outright ridiculous amount of content available off the rip, to the deep story and lore to lose yourself in. It’s evwrything an RPG fan could ever dream of with minimal bugs that are pretty much inescapable in massive open world games. I have never played anything that I can even compare to this game and I won’t for a while. I very rarely give anything a 10/10 but I’d be giving gaming as a medium a disservice if I didn’t because if I don’t, these triple a RPG’s wouldn’t be following the right person. It was even monetised so with utmost integrity without those garbage ass time savers or content locked behind a paywall beside the base games releas. The game released with all micro transactions free and extra single player content that they actually spent serious money on was charged at a perfect price considering Blood and wine is the size of some entire games out there.

Played in an open world with a third-person perspective, players control protagonist Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter known as a witcher, who is looking for his missing adopted daughter on the run from the Wild Hunt: an otherworldly force determined to capture and use her powers. Players battle the game's many dangers with weapons and magic, interact with non-player characters, and complete main-story and side quests to acquire experience points and gold, which are used to increase Geralt's abilities and purchase equipment.

Calasade,"Universal acclaim for this game is something I will NEVER understand. I suspect that most who give this game a positive review are casual gamers unfamiliar with what a true RPG is, or simply it's a matter of being caught up by the incredible aesthetics, which the Witcher 3 has in spades. It is a gorgeous looking game, at least on a high-end PC. Another positive is the story. It's heart-touching at times. BUT... The Witcher 3 suffers from serious faults. The role-playing is shallow (and sometimes non-existent, like when Geralt is forced to break his moral code). Sometimes, decisions are wrongly reflected and other times, not reflected at all. Most of the game is filler, meaning the majority of playing-time is consumed side-quests that have no impact at all on the main story or even Geralt. Worse, however, is that the side-quests use the same formula. Trust me when I say that once you've done one side-quest, you have pretty much done them all. The game also lacks replayability. The ultimate end is determined by a handful of decisions that come in short order following the Battle at Kaer Morhen. Simplistic, to say the least, but the true offense is that none of the decisions you make leading up to Kaer Morhen dictate any real change with that main battle or modify how the world reacts and treats Geralt. The game is always the same. Other faults include crappy, oh-so-crappy game mechanics. Not that fluidity is required when fighting, mind you. This is perhaps the easiest game I've ever played. Even on the so-called ""Death March"", it's a walk in the park. Do yourself a favor. If you're looking for that all too rarity ****, meaning a cRPG set in an open world, check out Assassin's Creed Odyssey. It's not nearly as dumbed down and the decisions you make actually determine how the game reacts to you. But better yet, go old school if you want a real cRPG experience. Check out Pillars of Eternity or the Baldur's Gate series, the last of which has been the king of all role-playing games since 2000. Play the Witcher 3 if you don't want to think, if you don't wish to be challenged, and all you want to do is ride around on the most irritating horse in the world while perusing the lovely scenery. If you want an action game with considerable role-playing options, something that's intended for thinking adults, look at Witcher 1 and Witcher 2. Witcher 3 isn't even the best in its own series.",2,2019-06-12,PC,user

bskierys,"Completing this game took me over 200 hours (including DLC's) and I don't regret any second spent with Geralt. Since then I played multiple open world games and I always compare them to this one. And to be honest, none of them stands a chance. They may have large worlds with tons of side-quests and content but compared to Witcher 3 - they all seem like generic fetch quests. I believe that what makes this game so special is the quests. Basic mechanics are pretty simple: you can fight enemies, investigate the area using the witcher senses and talk to the NPC's, but the execution and the story of these quests are what makes them so special. Almost every quest in the game has its own story with a twist, a moral choice, a reward and sometimes with the consequences at some point of the game. Did you free a poor unlucky man that was captured by some nilfgaardian guards? Too bad he turned out to be a thief and a murderer and you can find his victims later in the game. Shame. But the quests are not the only activities in this world. There are contracts (boss fights that requires you to learn what tactics are effective against which monster), super addictive card mini-game called Gwent and many more (some generic treasure hunting and bandit camps are also here). The combat system is deep and satisfying. Especially on higher difficulty settings. And the main story is just great. It is touching and engaging (especially for someone who read the books). One of the best if not the best game I ever played. If you are still hesitating - stop. Just buy the game.",10,2019-06-01,PC,user

Nimwe,"This is one of my favorite games of all time, and I've spent 70h on it (excluding dlcs) without ever truly reaching 100% completion. The main thing that strikes you while playing is the depth to which the devs worked on this, because most of the secondary missions do feel unique and have that main-questy vibe. The screenplay is as well written as the voice acting is done. The game is able to pull you into its world seamlessly, and it is a chore to get back to your daily routine. There are, however, a few things that would be better done in some other way in my opinion. First thing: the characters you encounter throughout the game, if they aren't main characters, they all look alike. This kind of breaks immersion when I accept two very distinct quests from the same old guy... Some other details: controls feel kind of clunky and unresponsive a lot of times. This was half addressed in an update which makes you choose between two distinct kind of controls, but they still can be better; the beginning of the game falls a bit flat, I remember distinctly not having as much fun as I had later in early stages. Nevertheless, this game is a masterpiece. It's kind of scary to think that a studio of finite dimensions can produce something this deep and large.",9,2019-05-09,PC,user

Netanel9530,"This game is amazing, it is perfect. reminds me of the good old Gothic games. It has limits in the role playing aspect, as you are a set character, but it sure as hell compensates with an interesting plot and well written characters. Combat is not best ever, but i even liked the gothic style, and that was utter garbage. The good, the game is dripping with atmosphere, the graphics are absolutely satisfying. The artistic and designers delivered a believable world, that is fierce, unsettling, but can be absolutely beautiful at times. The more you take away from the UI/HUD the more you will appreciate the game world. It could be improved im sure, and i hope CDPRed will improve it with time, but this is a great game already. Totally worth my money.",10,2019-04-21,PC,user

PetrPetrenko,"As for me this is overrated game. Of course it has some good aspects, especially compared to the present games, there are well written story, one of the best graphics even nowadays, fresh lore, not linear and bright side quests, charming characters and may be few others. I can give 7 or 8 for all this. But it's not very versatile in upgrading character, combat and skill systems. For the first look you could see some different skills, clothes, weapons, but all this don't bring big changes to game-play. If you start second or third time you can make some other decisions, complete some steps in different order, which would make you see other cut-scenes, but you are always gonna be a man with sword and very limited action set. There is no such things like was in ""Skyrim"" for example, where you could make much more different characters (I'm talking not only about appearance) and skill build really could completely change game process. So, it's more like mix of uncomplicated slasher and action adventure with some customization, huge world and variety of outcomes. And it's definitely well made mix but it's not give all that i wait from RPG. I was between 7 and 8 but after I've looked to all this 10 of 10, i had to rate 6 just to sick balance because game is not brilliant.",6,2019-04-06,PC,user
Mollomomo,"Despite having spoiled the game for myself by watching the gameplay, I still went and played 200 hours of it, finishing all side quests, all DLCs and the main story. It's a game that will remain an icon of game design, storytelling and good consumer practice in the decades to come. Of course there might be people who don't like the genre, or are put off by the long dialogues or the combat. However, once you get used to it, the combat is satisfying and technical, and the stories are captivating, touching and full of charm, even within the many side quests. It really feels like the world around you is alive and not just a cardboard cutout for you to walk in. If I could wipe my memory and play it again, I would.",10,2019-04-06,PC,user

Shellphie,"I first met the Witcher world for the first time just a couple of years ago. And the acquaintance began with books. Sapkovsky created a world that was absolutely unique in sensations - after reading you do not have a feeling of delight, but after you close the book you suddenly realize that it was very cozy, great and sincerely sorry to say goodbye to him. Attempts to flirt with an epic fantasy just spoiled the saga, and the coolest in the books remained the stories of the first two volumes and local events (as well as the last, recently published book, in the style of the first two collections). The first part of the game definitely got to the list of favorite ones because of the elaboration of the plot and the special, deep atmosphere. Medieval Vyzima, deaf forests with scattles, frightening swamps and strange inhabitants of it, ghosts of the fields ... The developers managed to ideally get into, fit into the world of Sapkowski, despite the fact that many plot motifs were repeated, and the characters themselves didn’t intersect with the saga either - they remembered Pan Andrzej once more in the pages of the manuscript. The second part was a step forward and at the same time in something a mistake. In technical terms, this was a completely new, unique pumping system, which excluded the possibility of turning the game into a slasher by notables - experience dripped from quests, and for environmental genocide they gave pennies. However, the atmosphericity of the books and the first part, their local cosiness, were sacrificed for political intrigues and large-scale decisions. The three locations of the world of the Second Witcher were not bad, but each of them lost any of the first part: The forests of Flotzam were monotonous than the swamps, although in reality there were more quests and opportunities, Lok Moinn did not fit into the concept of the Witcher (purely subjective opinion), only the location of the second act was more or less, but it was not enough. The main insult of the second part was the moment of the omission of the peasantry - the basis of medieval life and the disappearance of notes of Slavic (albeit too Germanized West Slavic, but still Slavic) myths and beliefs. The third part is the work on the bugs. In an amicable way, the only minus of the game is that you cannot follow several tasks on the map at once. Well, the levels are painfully easy - playing when completing secondary quests to level 12-14 becomes boring even on the third difficulty level. Although someone like. But here are the pluses ... The boundless expanses of the peasant settlements of Medieval Poland, the truly living inhabitants of Skelliga (and not the plastic monotonous fools from Skyrim), breathing the events of Novigrad - once you get here, you don’t want to return. Old heroes and even minor characters in the book saga are returning (oh, what a pity for Lashorel, this is my favorite story!). Before the stupid, creepy witches, the beautiful Iwasik, the **** Bloody Baron - and all this only in the first part of the game! The characters of all these characters are revealed cooler than in half of modern films - bravo to the authors of the dialogues and our translators and actors, by the way, too (if not for the damned timing and laconic, but so short for phonetics English, because of which the replicas are in Russian they greatly accelerated! And how the third-party quests are worked out - the most interesting are not only the main quests of the plot, but also additional tasks and orders that are not related to it. In every house of this vast world, there is a tremendous amount of work. the previous parts were quite ""closed"" and the Witcher's fans, in principle, loved him from out of the giant expanses. And with them, an abundance of interesting finds, constant innovations, the game would not get bored. Great creation! I did not find any glitches and other bugs during the passage, I do not chase graphics, in those terms everything suits me. Absolute 10 out of 10",10,2019-02-26,PC,user

Gelaos,"First and foremost, I'd like to thank Mr. Andrzej Sapkowski for his Witcher book series that served as inspiration for all the Witcher games. Dziękuję bardzo! Also, READ THE BOOKS BEFORE PLAYING THE GAME! Or at least find someone who has read them to give you detailed summary of the plot and events in the book series. ----- Just as the W2, Wild Hunt works best as a story-oriented action adventure. The universe, lore, characters, story and dialogues are simply great. The gameplay is average to above-average and when judged from this perspective, Witcher 3 isn't really memorable game. The combat is too simplistic, but still fun. RPG elements are way too primitive (I don't consider any Witcher game to be an 'RPG'), the world's too big and exploring it feels somewhat dull. The main problem with W3 is that it gets repetitive and predictable too soon. Almost all quests go like this: talk to NPC -> use Witcher sense (which is INCREDIBELY dumb ability from both lore and gameplay perspective) -> fight with generic enemies -> (repeat 2 times) -> get a reward. Enjoyable at first, pretty dumb and boring after a while. Same logic applies for other aspects of the game. Witcher 3 has great story, universe and characters. But apart from that it's just well-crafted modern open-world game - enjoyable but lacking any deeper gameplay value. Nothing more, nothing less. ------ Again, GO READ THE BOOKS FIRST.",8,2019-02-07,PC,user

Every quest is well written and has a meaning, and they are well disposed all around the world. The graphics are amazing, both from a technical and an art-style point of vue (and many mods are available to improve it even further).

I did the mistake to start with alot, and then I meen ALOT of ""?"" quests so my level become significantly higher then the main quest that now become a bit to easy even on a higher difficulty level.

Kirill_Rubanov,"Игра очень интересная, 4 прохождения за спинной, более 1000 часов геймплея. Плюсы: 1. Сюжет и квесты. Самый большой плюс Ведьмака - это именно задания(Сюжет, квесты). Именно в них вы прочувствуете игру, они приведут вас по разным уголкам карты, познакомят вас с разными персонажами, заставят вас делать ОЧЕНЬ трудные выборы, которые напомнят о себе спустя долгое время. 2. Хорошая графика. Не скажу что графика топ 1, но мне зашла. 3. Русский. Русские субтитры, озвучка, приятные голоса. Много разнообразных русских слов, как же не упомянуть маты, в игре их достаточно, даже складывается чувство, что игру создавали в России. 4. NPC. В игре много NPC для взаимодействия, у NPC хорошая харизма и озвучка, интересные диалоги с выходом на разные концовки этих диалогов. 5. Свобода выбора. Самый сок Ведьмака, свобода выбора везде, абсолютно, игру можно пройти десятки раз и она не надоест, если конечно её проходить по разному. 6. Атмосфера игры. Атмосфера очень проработана. Действия происходят во время войны двух держав, это видно не только на полях боя, которые завалены трупами, а в сожжённых деревнях, загнивающих от голода сёлах. В деревнях люди работают, устраивают кулачные бои, пьют в тавернах. Доски объявлений, случайные диалоги и задания. Это всё в сумме даёт именно ту топовую атмосферу. 7. Открытый мир. Мир ведьмака ОГРОМЕН, в нём сложно заскучать. Большое количество разнообразных локаций, пещер, деревень. У каждой локации своя атмосфера, своя музыка, каждая локация по своему принимается душой, ты чувствуешь каждый уголок по своему. 8. Снаряжение. Броня, мечи, арбалеты, броня на лошадь. Снаряжения в этой игре очень большое количество, всё снаряжение в игре вы не соберёте даже играя тысячи часов, будет хоть один десяток предметов, который вы не найдёте с 50+ прохождения. Минусы: 1. Плотва. У Плотвы немало багов, но это скорее стало её фишкой, чем недостатком. Плотва бывает неизвестно где, вытворяет непонятные вещи. Мне это даже нравится (Каждому своё). 2. Идеальность. После Ведьмака будет сложно искать себе игру, так как все игры будут сравниваться с Ведьмаком и будут хуже него, остальные игры будут казаться отсталыми и скучными, заставляя вернуться в этот шедевр.",10,2018-12-21,PC,user

Ulysses_Drax,"I MADE AN EGREGIOUS ERROR. OMG. I just started playing The Witcher 3 for the first time, and holy hell!!! What a stunningly amazing, and rich game. Deeply interwoven and sophisticated. It makes every Bethesda game, with their silly, short, and shallow quests and stories, look like children had made them. Literally. One's not even able to compare them properly. They're leagues apart on practically every level. CDPR tower over Bethesda, and they were a smaller group of developers when they made TW3! They understand art, storytelling, player choice, open world, design, detail, balance, and so so so much more. I'm done with Bethesda. They were in prime position to take RPG gaming to the next level, but they went backwards, big time. TH should be fired. PH should be fired. EP should definitely be fired more than anyone else. As well as the hidden decision makers. They take years to produce those RPG **** What a laugh! When a game like The Witcher 3 is played, one can see what's possible in RPG gaming, and you can easily make the stance that Bethesda contains high levels incompetence, stupidity, laziness, greed, and luck. Goodbye Bethesda. Hello CDPR.",10,2018-12-20,PC,user

Javichuck,"Es un rpg de acción en un mundo fantástico basado en las novelas de Andrzej Sapkowski. La jugabilidad centrada en el combate tiene mucha profundidad y distintas ramas(fisico, magias, alquimia) para que podamos potenciar aquellas que nos vengan mejor con nuestra manera de jugar. La historia principal es muy buena y las misiones secundarias tienen el mismo nivel hasta tal punto que cuesta distinguirlas. El mundo está vivo y tiene una gran cantidad de contenido y detalles. Artísticamente es una pasada, en 4K el mejor juego que he visto actualmente. La música igual, eligiéndola específicamente para ciertos momentos que se te quedan grabados en la memoria. No es necesario especificar cada punto ya que todo es un 10 en mi opinión. Se ha convertido en mi juego favorito y recomiendo a cada persona que me pregunta que lo juegue ya mismo.

Sejo,"To say that this videogame and this company taught how things should be done well is to fall short. First I will talk about the game: - Strengths that make this saga so special: The story (not only the main one, but the stories of each characters in the secondary missions), the narrative, the characters (they already have a story to tell, they feel alive), the setting (each site has its enemies and its history), the variety of enemies they have gotten, the amount of hours it contains and how it can be rejuvenated due to the different paths we take during the plot, the details, the company policies of CD PROJEKT (the best in a videogame company, even more, before teaching Cyberpunk at E3, they said that micropayments were something for others, that they offer quality and offer what you pay, as is, so these statements are important since almost no company could say this and this company has gained the benefit of the doubt), the gameplay (some people like Jose, others are cool, I like it, it's fast and comfortable), music, sound are wonderful , and a long etc. - Points that weaken: The control of the horse and Geralt is sometimes a little crazy (depending on the areas that we go and clear speed), I do the analysis now but the game was spent years ago and I wanted to squeeze it to the maximum (after play 1000 hours to the title) and still contains some bugs (and that CD Projekt solved each error had been quickly to offer the best expreciencoa to the consumer), and that's it, for me has no more weak points. Why a 10? There is no perfect game, now or ever, but for me a 10 to a video game means that it is worth what you pay for and it is worth every cent of what it costs, not having this game aueencima is 30 euros or less. GOTY in some pages seems an insult to me in this world and in question to quality. CD Projekt earned my respect and because of how the videogame industry is today with abusive micropayments and those **** **** companies like CD Projekt give a ray of hope to this world and make the players of before we join and appreciate what what is really the quality and being happy of a product, if CD Projekt fails, it will be all holders",10,2018-12-09,PC,user

The Witcher 3 it's story and it's dialogs are absolutely mind blowing. The way the implemented romances and Geralt's sarcams are pure geniusly. The witcher 3's gameplay is really smooth and surprisingly easy actually. Making a game with sword fights can be very tricky, yet they nailed it! If everything isn't already perfect, then gwent definitely is the finishing touch. Making a perfect game in en even better game is out of this world!

ReiAyanami,"alright let's get the good out of the way right now, it has amazing graphics & a huge expansive open world. Now onto the rest, First off, the combat is really bad. There is little to no variety in encounters and combat outside of a boss, every mechanic feels annoying in some way like a bandit parrying a master swordsman of a witcher or a wolf jumping out of the way at the right moment, these built in mechanisms to prevent combat from being easy are just as annoying as Assassins creed, hell that's what the combat is most like to be honest. Geralt moves like a **** 80 yr old suffering from severe Arthritis. The RPG mechanics feel out of place a lot, like wow, a potion that gives me 10% bonus damage on a contract monster I already killed that would take me several minutes (lets say 10) to actually create, amazing. Or having to repair armor and weapons, why? Food and drinks being required to heal are annoying too. Then all that gear - when it essentially boils down to just remaining leveled, because that's the artificial nonsensical difficulty of this game. Geralt can take on the wild hunt, but stay away from that level 10 rotfiend because even though he can slay all those level 3 rotfiends, this one is too much for this god-tier warrior. The Main Questline is incredibly repetitive, 90 % of the story can be summed up like this, Go to one town, Ask someone about Ciri, Get set on a Monster hunting quest, return & ask about Ciri, play a short flashback as Ciri, regain Control as Geralt, leave town & repeat this for 35 **** hours. Wow really the pinnacle of storytelling right here. The side quests don't fare much better either, Go to an NPC, they lost their brother, mother in law, wife, dog, uncle to some **** monster. You use your witcher senses, Geralt goes ""hmmm blood tracks, looks like there was a fight"", you find the monster, kill the monster, get reward. Repeat. Oh and let's not forgetting searching for someone's **** frying pan. Holy **** i'm really blown away. Overall: High 5/Low 6/10",5,2018-11-16,PC,user

DrSiko,"Let me first say, I spent 100 hours on The Witcher 3 and I still didn't finish the main plot, not started with the DLCs yet, so while I still have much play hours to go, I think my past hours allows me to review the game. The environment is beautful to being with. It is the best game to show the medieval ages which is gloomy, dangerous, stink everywhere and peasants are struggling hard to survive the consequences of wars, unlike other medieval RPG games which shows you people dress well, streets are clean and buildings are like built yesterday. Every city, town and village shows a bit of unique looks, while NPCs will eventually repeat the same one-liners and sentences which can be disappointing. Much side quests to indulge with, and they're all written well, not those burdensome fetch quests you find in Skyrim often. Cutscenes are likable and characters are fun when they talk and argue. The combat system is very basic. It's like designed for people who are playing RPG for the first time. There are not much moves to do which makes the combat boring. The signs are fun to use for some hours until they feel repetitive. Leveling is really bad in this game. You don't feel you have ""leveled up"" like other RPG games. They stealthly improve your attack and defense points without knowing it. You don't know what was exactly improved. In my 100 hours, I didn't have to use spells because I simply didn't need them. Oils, not really. Some oils sometimes are very hard to make because some ingredient is hard to find and I won't waste hours to find it and better try my chance without it. The inventory and quest UIs are horrendous. Looking for a quest? Go through 3-4 tabs with 50+ rows each. Worst is, they're not sorted by name, level or anything. Inventory can be messy and everything is in one place. While they break into food, weapons and armor, etc, but try looking for a particular item in the spells inventory, and you'll be lost among other 150+ items. What's more disappointing is, it's not worthy to work hard to get that fine sword or armor, because you'll simply find better 1-2 levels later. I worked for 3 hours on a side quest to build me an armor, just to replace it with a better armor 2 HOURS LATER. Killing monsters while exploring is useless. Who in the world thought that players shouldn't be given experience points for slaying monsters or bandits?? The landscape while huge, it's ""too real"" it gets boring to explore. The question marks thrown all over the map is just either a monster nest, a treasure guarded by some monster, or a bandit camp. That's it. There is no dungeons to discover or landmarks to explore. The music is astonishing and makes a great background. Currently, I'm playing it to finish it rather than enjoying it. Having a game which the first hour is the same as 100th hour is really boring. Oh, and the first 10 hours of the game? The most boring I had. I had to stop playing the game twice until a friend convinced me to play it and pass the tedious first hours to get to the meat, which I really enjoyed later, but now it's becoming boring again, maybe until I start the DLCs.",7,2018-11-12,PC,user

Xounari,"The goods: Amazing main and side storyline, good charecters, detailed and beautiful world, variety of weapons and armor, good skill system. Good DLCs that are a must have and in my opinion are even better than the main game. Especially Blood and Wine is a must have, both story wise and gameplay wise. The not so goods: the combat is pretty straight forward dodge, counter, attack. Signs seem pretty useless, countering and dodging is way more important on higher difficulty than using spells (signs) and there isnt a way to play ""wizard"" Geralt. Melee builds are way superior to other builds. You don't ever get the feeling of being a powerful unstoppable witcher, because the combat feels very basic and progressing just makes you hit harder but doesnt really make you feel more powerful.",9,2018-10-15,PC,user
psylife,"The combat has weight and managing the stamina adds a welcome tactical layer to the experience ; that said the game knows only to challenge you by spawning a stupid amount of enemies. Button mashing is often necessary and interior combat is as bad as it gets, which is a situation the game puts you in often. The magic signs have their importance but you will be spending most of your time recharging your shield which essentially confines your magic abilities to boosting your armor. The perks, abilities, and weapon upgrades are mechanically useful yet they fail to excite beyond their functionality. Dialogue wise, the genealogy of answers is quite shallow and deprived of branching - Suffice to experience Deus ex: Human revolution's dialogue system to understand what I mean by that. There is no ""Game"" to be found in the dialogue mechanics. The characters are inanimate dolls and the choices on offer are nothing more than a bunch of glorified playback buttons. Exploration wise, I think the game does a descent job in terms of environmental story telling, but nothing that is worth the praises beyond the best the competition has to offer. Shenmue 2 does much more in my opinion and the game came out nearly 20 years ago. The investigative phases are a real joke too, where you are mindlessly following red marks - yet another example of shallow, unaccomplished mechanic. The pacing is a real problem too ; During the first half of the game (10hrs), the story literally stalls. The game becomes more engaging once you reach the second half, but it feels too little too late. The characters are likable and by the end of the game I did feel some attachment towards some of them. The difficulty is also an issue, where the beginning happens to be much harder than the end; I beat the final bosses on my first attempts while being vastly under-leveled. The visuals are fairly bland retrospectively ; For instance, I find the sunsets particularly vulgar and over-saturated . The towns also, lack authenticity in their structure and layout, and that is particularly jarring if you compare it to the original Assassin's creed's urban layout, which feel substantially more authentic and researched. To conclude, I'd say that the disproportionate success and admiration this game has generated, comes from the fascination that the average nerd historically hold toward medieval sword and shields ; It's the ""game of thrones"" generation that has brought Wild hunt to the pinnacle. Wild hunt is not a bad game, it's just so far from being this timeless masterpiece.",5,2018-10-14,PC,user

Sonny_Fontaine,"This is an okay game, but certainly not ""the best RPG of all time"" as many have claimed. I've never played Witcher 2, tried Witcher 1 (Enhanced Edition) for couple of hours, but I've read tons of reviews and gamer's opinions about Witcher 3 before starting playing it. This game has a lot of advantages but it has even more flaws. PROS: Start of the game is very detailed with tutorial in every aspect of the game. Story looks very promising and intriguing. Combat (in open areas) is good, various of mechanics and styles of fighting. Mods can improve that even more. Main quests seems okay so far, story plays slow, but it manages to keep tension. Huge open world with beautiful nature. Characters graphical view - face, eyes, lips, nose, body, color looks amazing. CONS: Most of side quests are too boring, you just play them to get exp, loot or more gold. Dialogues (mostly side quests) are boring too. I mostly just skip side quests dialogues just to get to the point and get it done. Stupid non-enemy AI - if you stand on the road with your horse, villagers can't simply get pass you, they just bash into you every time. Terrible character control in the city - witcher can't get passed other villagers peacefully too, once he starts walking/running in the city - he bashes everyone around like some crazy guy, steps on chairs, tables etc. Close quarters combat is hell - if you find yourself in a fight, in a small room it's going to be nightmare. You can't concentrate on certain opponent for more that 2 seconds, you pressing mouse and keyboard to fight one enemy, game decides to attack other, camera sometimes starts jump crazy too and you can't see witcher any more, sometimes you lose control over your character completely, especially when you have to make fast decisions - you press roll, but witcher just keeps standing in place and dying, you press dodge - witcher refused to do that. Graphics look good, but it could be better in sharpening aspect - game's world look too sharpened on high and too blurry on low. It can only be fixed with some graphical mods. There are some bugs too - citizens sometimes floating in air, roach appearing in air and some optional quest lines not appearing in journal and failling after you pass certain point of quest. Right now I'm at this point where I'm wondering whether to continue to play this game or not, I hesitate. Main story is what still keeps me going like I mentioned before, I want to know what's gonna happen next. But other than, there's nothing really that special about Witcher 3 and it's certainly not ""RPG king of all time"" for me. Everyone that loves RPGs should try Witcher 3 themselves, because it really depends on many aspects, some will love it and some will hate it, and both side would be right. However this game is far from the best.",6,2018-09-06,PC,user

I didn't finish most of the horse races and card games (there are lots of them), but still it took me about 100 hours to finish the first play through.

polski8bit,"One of the best action RPG's I've ever played. It's not perfect in any way, nor it is a revolution in games mechanics - it's just a rock solid game with a couple of bugs, like every other game. The main story is decent, not amazing, but not bad either, enough for me to keep playing and wanting to unfold it. The world is large, beautiful and full of details, filled with content - though here i have to say that it's not perfect either, because most of it are just marks on the map, repetitive and with time boring thing to chase, only to get the 100%. Gameplay is solid as well, dialogs, character creation, exploration, combat, all of it is combined so good that it delivers entertainment of the highest level there is. And with Expansions - so Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine - The Witcher 3 definitely deserves a 10 out of 10.",10,2018-08-30,PC,user

Foltest,"I am normally very reserved in assigning a 10/10 rating to anything. While The Witcher 3 is not perfect, it is one of the finest games I've ever played in 30 years of playing video games. The scope and size of the game is enormous, feels like 2x the size of Skyrim. At about 35 hours in, I've only explored about 50% of the map. This game takes all that was good about Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Skyrim, and of course, previous Witcher titles and wraps them in one cohesive package. Graphics, atmosphere, sound is second to none, the attention to detail is amazing. And the game runs well and is stable: I struggle to remember coming across any bugs.",10,2018-08-13,PC,user

PhalangX,"The first 10/10 I have EVER given as this engagement, this commitment to the gamer and the game, to the story and the world, by the developer and makers just has to be commended and honoured. This Game ****, just THE BEST game I have played since at the time elder scrolls oblivion, which was a blast and NEVER before was a world so immersive like Oblivion, at release and after there where of cause bugs and so on, THIS is something the Witcher 3 is far less affected by which is a great + on my scale. this incredible feeling of immersion it was I reencountered within the Witcher 3. It was a blast, of cause it is a Game that means there are things that are just not possible yet or that are bound to code possibilities and at times it breaks the immersion. BUT never did it do this irreparably and ALWAYS for mere seconds, immediately followed by the next hand reaching out for you from the Monitor to draw you back in XD: (Figuratively of cause yet with the same force.) I had no problem with the combat system as others critiqued on a very high level of nitpicking, as of cause a system like Dragons Dogma would make it even MORE epic. Yet the fight is INTENSE on every difficulty but even more the higher it gets just like you want it to be. You need to make use of EVERYTHING you have and thats A LOT! the cinematics are GREAT near PERFECT and the story is as high stakes as it gets in a universe like this the Characters are loveable and the drama unfolding really gets you. But the MOST crucial point of cause is...your decision...does it impact? or is it Mass Effect 4, Fallout 4 like? where no matter what answer you choose the same outcome is scripted from the beginning?NO, your actions have HUGE impact often outright deciding over life and death of even MAIN story character. Depending on your choices actions will get set in motion that have personal- social- nation- AND WORLD/-WIDE effects. There are multiple endings depending on your choices, that are played out, not simply Pictured, but a mix of both, depending on world decisions and personals. There are so many things to talk about that are great that I could literally go on FOR BOOKS! But the afterwards released 2 DLC's That together make A WHOLE SECOND GAME in the SAME QUALITY and a new part of the world, makes my rating the first 10/10 I have given as this engagement, this commitment to the gamer and the game, to the story and the world, by the developer and makers just has to be commended and honored. Since every second of gameplay screams ,,WE WANT TO GIVE YOU THE **** so do I. We as the gaming community should in every possible way support, this very lonesome attitude (!!!!), in the gaming world of paywalls and timers, freemium and 1000's of $ for games not worth 1/1000 of the Witcher 3! IT IS IMPOSSIBLY GREAT and you should BUY IT multiple times even if you can for you and your friends just to support the developer. Look what emotion even the review triggered in me.

Endomorfismo,"Very good but this game would be better if it wasn´t an open world game, to much filler, this hurt´s the game more than helping it..",8,2018-08-02,PC,user
thaesino,"I've been putting off writing this review for some time now, mostly because I wanted to know if it was just a ""wow effect"" and nothing more. But, alas, it was not. The Wtcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of the most exceptional games ever made (and I've played it through on both PS4 and PC, but my review is for the PC version, which removes all FPS drops of the PC, naturally). Whether this game came at the perfect time (post-Skyrim, Mass Effect 1-3, and Last of Us); whether it was the immense amount of work clearly put in it; whether it was that we were all finally ready to read long dialogues again, and be immersed in a new world of a novelist's making; or whether it was simply that the game was hyped for so long, delayed twice, and finally delivered with the promise of two incredible DLCs (a promise kept), this game has taken the torch from whatever the last ""Greatest Game Ever Made"" was - be it for you Ocarina of Time, Half-Life 2, Super Mario Galaxy 1&2, Fallout 3 or NV, the Ezio Trilogy, God of War or World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy I-XIII-2, GTA IV and V, or Tetris and Super Mario Bros. - and, in my opinion, is still waiting for the next game to take it forth the next few hundred kilometers (and no, Breath of the Wild, for me, did not take The Witcher's torch - it almost did, but couldn't). I do not say this lightly. I am not fanboying/fangirling. I played the game, twice, DLCs and all, and waited months before making this review. And here's what I've come to appreciate. But first, let me be clear - No game, except Tetris (for obvious reason) deserves a 10/10, because no game can be as perfect, considering technology available. My 9/10 is for one simple reason - bugs that can never be fixed. But my 9/10 also means, I see what is wrong with the game, which is very little, and I see what is right with it, which is overwhelmingly much more. Let's move on: Story: 10/10 (first DLC 9/10; second DLC 9/10 - mostly because they play more like movies than games, and feel really outside of the atmosphere of the main game, imho; especially Blood and Wine, despite how fun it was). I don't need to say it, and I'm not spoiling it. The Story in Witcher 3 is one of the best in any game ever made. I know very few people who did not cry at some point, or who did not laugh at many, or cringe and feel embarrassed at others, as they would watching a movie or reading a book. Well-blended with the next point (its Visuals), the story in Witcher 3 was positively heightened in quality by how much work was given to facial gestures and characters. It isn't clunky like other RPGs. Graphics/Visual Attention - 10/10 - Witcher 3 is a beautiful game that fits perfectly before and after other beautiful games of 2015. The world feels alive. People do things. Animals and creatures do things. Nature does things. And all things are done on their own time. If it rains, people run to cover. If there's lightning, they run inside. Animals and monsters, alike, have predators, and they are also prey of others, likewise. Horses seek nourishment and water when left alone. Lightning does not strike twice in the same place. There is even a full lunar eclipse! Last point of argument. Adult Ciri KEEPS facial gestures from pre-pubescent Ciri. That's how much attention was given to visuals and the natural liveliness of the game. Music - 9.5/10 - Why 9.5/10? Because I'm a musician and composer, and I know when more can be done, and when less can be exposed. So I'm biased by my experience. But the music in Witcher 3 is some of the best we've seen since the old days of Oblivion or Morrowind. I'd argue it's better than the music in Journey, even. Definitely better than that one memorable track in Last of Us or Uncharted. If you want a short taste of it, go on YouTube and listen to Priscilla's song. Don't watch the scene... just the song; preferably in Polish, but it's up to you. Audio - 10/10 - People cough and sneeze. Monsters can be heard munching on other creatures. Thunder can scare. Doors closing by themselves can frighten. Floorboards may creek. Mechanics/Controls - 9.5/10 - There are bugs, very minor ones... you know, like a fly going around the dinner table during a wonderful dinner with many friends. The company is perfect, the food is great, the drinks are plenty, but there's that one damn fly every now and then. If you disregard it, however, you'll have a wonderful night. (Also, I disagree this is like Dark Souls series, but whatever) Replayability - umm... yeah... what year is it? 2018? I just started replaying it last night, again. This will be my 3rd playthrough, possibly taking me upwards of 200+ hours. And I wouldn't be surprised if it's the last RPG I ever finish. Enjoy!",9,2018-07-30,PC,user

AbeMC,"The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt needed to be an epic, satisfying conclusion to the Witcher trilogy, and for the most part, it succeeds. Many characters from previous games return, the graphics are glorious, the writing is sharp and poignant, interface and combat is greatly improved. But there is suddenly a ton of confusing exposition in the final act, and while story side-quests are done well, the average village contract reuses encounter mechanics over and over. Not the 10/10 game that reviewers hype it to be, but a strong 8/10 – and absolutely worth the $20 it frequently discounts to during sales. Total size on my hard-drive (GOTY): 36GB ++ Superb bestiary. The number of different creatures you’ll face is stunning in its variety. ++ Excellent cast of interesting characters. ++ Excellent DLC. Hearts of Stone and Blood & Wine are must-buy content. Go for the GOTY edition. + Narrative choices are real. + Most complaints from the Witcher 2 have been addressed / fixed. Fast travel. Clean and clear inventory. Less clunky combat. + Graphics are stunning and fairly light on resources for a modern title. I averaged between 60-90 fps on High @1080p with an RX 470. + The cities feel alive. Pedestrians in the streets, merchants on the corners, guards on patrol, bandits lurking in the back alleys. + Excellent side-quests. + Excellent faction quests. + Excellent soundtrack. A clever mix of medieval-style folk music with a big Hollywood-style orchestral score. + Mature themes. You’ll see people being beaten, burned and hung. As Geralt, you’ll be propositioned, threatened with dismemberment, and see others threatened with worse. You’ll also observe some sexy times with Geralt & your romance choice. If you are trying to get in an hour of gameplay after putting your kids to bed, make sure they are REALLY asleep before booting up the Witcher 3. + Out of combat or conversation, save anywhere, any time. +/- Decent story. Ciri is being pursued by the spectral Wild Hunt, Geralt tracks her across the land, hoping to reach her before the Hunt does. “Go here, help this person, then they’ll tell you more about Ciri” is two-thirds of the main story. In between, Geralt has to solve his personal relationships, save Dandelion (again!), becomes embroiled with the Lodge of Sorceresses (again!), while meddling with spies, statecraft, and intrigue. All good stuff, though I missed The Witcher 2’s tighter focus. +/- Combat, once understood, flows smoothly and quickly in space. It is of the “a few quick swipes, dodge, a few more quick swipes, dodge again etc.” variety. Once you learn a beast’s attack pattern (and acquire some good gear), everything becomes almost too easy. +/- I didn’t mind the constant soft-target-lock-on, but players used to more complete control will get annoyed fast. - Iorveth (from the Witcher 2) is nowhere to be seen. - Still laden with random bugs and glitches. - Narrative suffers from level-gating. If you’re just playing for the story, and don’t want to wander the land in search of random contracts, you’ll consistently find yourself under-leveled. - Tons of stuff to do in the villages you’ll find as you explore. But do I really want to follow footprints or a chem trail for the umpteenth monster contract? Fatigue doesn’t set in too quickly thanks to the large enemy pool, but the re-used encounters can’t be hidden. - Geralt has a copious number of skills that can be leveled and placed in one of twelve ability slots. Everything from perks to magic upgrades and better sword skills needs to be placed in a slot for it to be active; otherwise, you can level it as much as you want, but it won’t have any effect. Upgrades must ALSO be put into ability slots, meaning as your level increases, your build becomes more focused on one or two talents, instead of on multiple skills. Unnecessarily restrictive in a game that relies on variety to maintain interest. - A cutscene plays when loading a new region that summarizes Geralt’s or Citi’s current situation. The cutscene updates / changes based upon where you are in the story. But if you find you need to go from Velen to Skellige to Kaer Morhen and back to Velen without advancing the story, you’ll watch that same cutscene over and over again. The Witcher 3 is a game that every fan of role-playing games should own. Not because of the vast amount of content, but because the content itself is of such a high quality. Unlike near-annual franchises that have copy-and-pasted stories and activities, the developers of The Witcher 3 clearly gave a damn. While every game has its flaws, the product of their care and attention is one of the best role-playing games of this gaming generation.",8,2018-06-24,PC,user

OZcomingFRoo,"I like the Witcher 3 and its deep lore and content. I do however , like to mention one negative thing about this game and good. Combat animation is bare bones and unreliable. Without combat mods in PC , the game could be hard on situations where its shouldn't. Luckily , even for Console gamers , the way you're suppose to fight isn't just using your swords , but using potions and oils to increase damage and such. which leads me to the good thing I want to mention Enemy variety is a major plus that only Witcher 3 has over tons of other open world games in the gen. And by variety , I not only mean vampires , humans , elves , spiders etc... I mean the way you're suppose to fight them differently and how they fight you themselves. Something Destiny lacks unlike Halo..... Seriously , how many enemy types are in assassins creed origin ? Shadow of War ? Far cry 4 ? heck GTA 5 only has one ""enemy"" type (it is successful in other parts but I digress). This is how you make a GAME , challenging and making you learn all its mechanics and features to beat it. Regardless , the story and lore are just another great part about the game. Truly , a GOTC (Game Of The Century)",8,2018-06-20,PC,user
Hambarr,"Excellent game with an extremely well-written story through various main and side quests, an immense open-world map you can explore and complete for hours and hours of gameplay. Characters are really appealing for the most part of them. The main story will occasionally make you laugh or cry by the quality of the voice lines and the difficulty of some choices. Moreover the game is really beautiful, allowing you to discover amazing landscapes with diversified environments. The DLCs add two new areas, plenty of new quests to complete Geralt's story and a lot of new characters.",10,2018-06-18,PC,user
Avekade,"There is everything that good game needs: beautiful open world, interesting and charismatic characters, interaction with NPCs, funny humour and, of course, the world without a censorship: social problems like inequality, racism, hatred, genocide and poverty. The gameplay part is great. For me, the combat system is awesome: it is difficult and, at the same time, possible to deal with. Also, I haven't experienced many technical issues in spite of having average hardware. The story is great because you don't know what happens next: your actions have consequences and the ending depends on your actions. To conclude, I'd like to say that the game, in spite of all its pros, isn't made for second walkthrough. However, I'm not gonna put 9/10 because I had great experience first time and my emotions are based on the first time when everything was new and undiscovered.",10,2018-06-17,PC,user

Not only because of ist content but also because of every way the developers are handling everything around the game.

Legendb2015,"While yes its a beauty of a world its not without its bugs and game design flaws. It's very linear and not a free roam ""choose your game play/decision"" open world like your led to believe. If you dont stick to the linear path of the main story you quickly become too weak to do any side quests/free roaming activities that give out too low of XP to do anything but add filler in between main story missions. If you're a completionist be warned, you'll drive yourself crazy trying to complete every quest and start noticing your failing quests you had no idea you could fail do to poor quest activators/indicators and a quest design system. Also achievements are bugged, qwent cards are bugged, some dont stack and you spend hours upon hours collecting them all only to realize you cant get the last few in your deck because they didnt/still havent fixed qwent cards being stackable. Also to note some qwent cards are locked behind a merchant thats locked in a cage with a bandit leader thats suppose to drop a key to the cage thats bugged and for alot of users he never drops the key. Its been reported for months on their tech forums but never fixed...very buggy game, alot of flaws in their system. Crafting system is pointless, its better to buy greater runetsones you need then to go through the crappy process of crafting a blank runestone, 2 lesser runestones, 2 normal runestones, then finally get that 1 greater runestones...after all that you could of just spent 1200 on the greater runestone and saved 1000's of coin/supplies. Some terrible designs.....should of had more time for testing/bug/design flaws to be worked out. **update** 6/4/18** Changing review from a 6 to a now 9 after other games have failed HARD in comparison and this one has shined so much more in terms **** story and fun combat once you get the hang of it. I'll actually be going back to play this again as most games today cant hold a candle. Yes, its worth a second play through even years later.

Jibjab,Nothing but amazing!. This game caught me off guard. The story was good ( I love how it’s a branching **** combat was fantastic( the best way to play it is with a controller).Sidequests actually have a purpose and don’t feel like they were there for the sake of them being there(*ahem assassins creed). The graphics are phenomenal to this date(there are many mods to make it look even better). I have played this game over 3 times and I still wouldn’t mind playing it all over again(there’s actually an enhanced edition for free on the PC version. This mod rectifies some combat issues that people had on the PC version and also makes the game harder ),9,2018-05-09,PC,user

rmbmacko,"By far the best game I've ever played. I've tried the Witcher 1 and 2 before, really liked the theme, but this is the game where everything gets perfect. Fantastic atmosphere, huge open world, lots of side quest, can solve supernatural crimes, nice sword combat, magic and shooting. This is one of the few open wolrd games, where I truly enjoyed discovering the wolrd and travel a lot for doing the quests. Graphics and soundtracks are amazing, just stopped thousands of times just to look around and listen to the music. And on the top of all that, I got such a great story, that I didn't expect I would care that much. I spent a lot of time with this game, I cant wait to replay it again sometime.

Hurush,"This game was an amazing one! It really deserves that many rewards that recieved. So first things first, my honest vote for this one is an 9.5, The Witcher 3 truly surpasss everything that open worlds ever gave us! So, about storyline: you wont regret that many hours listenning to Geralt´s voice, because the storyline is very solid, you can enjoy it by far! It has great characters with great emotions and they really demonstrate that to the players ... The voice actors in this game got to other level of class, mainly Geralt, the main character, he is always speaking with that deep voice! Now let´s change the topic and go for atmosphere and world: In my opinion, this game is has the best atmosphere ever created in the history of videogames. We are always hearing the musical instruments, the songs are just amazing! The trees always moving, the grass is gorgeous, like no words to the ambient created! Bonus things : you have a lot of side quest waiting for you in this awesome world ... many choises to make, many of them have impact in the way that the things go! There are many ends in the game, +30! Good ones, and bad one, depends on you! So considering all of this, my expirence was so great, so I decided to give an 9.5 to this awesome game! It´s a ""must buy game"" for sure! Do it ...",9,2018-04-29,PC,user
Macgee,"Do you know what made it so good? It's the STORY. Touching and some even unpredictable. I can say it true to life, which we can only hope for the best, doing the best, but sometimes get what we deserve to get (and it's not the best). Consequences are the best part of its story system. Even most of who played this game will feel dull for playing another game with the same genre. Love, family, humanity (non-human-ity included), all packed with good dilemmas. The characters are filled with unique characteristic. The worst thing, if you are deep connected to this game, you'll feel empty like begging for the 4th installment (and we know they'll not making it while they focusing on Cyberpunk 2077). Played so much RPG games in my life but this one made it marks after Suikoden 1 & 2 in my place. So what about the graphic, the world, and combat system. It just very good. Packed so perfect that I shouldn't explain it too much. Because for me, the power that make it even more beautiful is the story. Some of senior (PS One) gamer sure know what Gensou Suikoden (1 & 2) looks like, 2D mixed with 3D, but the story lives until now. Even so much beautiful games packed with superior graphic like FF Series, but still, they feel dull by the lack of story contents. The adult contents sure make it playable for adult only. Maybe it's good for in-game story addition (and for making it more honest) but it's not like porn film anyway. You want to play a main character in a movie? Play this, and you'll regret there's no 4th installment near the date. :)",10,2018-04-27,PC,user
D3NGZ,"NO SPOILERS - Story - so immersive and rich it spans across 3 continents, the Voice acting is on such a high level across the board it is astonishing really. nothing feels short or meaningless also this is probably the only open world game that has side content just as good as the main one. Combat - The Combat system is fluid and fun to use with many options to use from, 5 Witcher Signs, 2 Swords , Crossbow , Bombs , Decoctions & Potions. the systems are intergrating with each other perfectably but this only applies to Deathmarch and Blood and Broken Bones difficulty, playing on easy or normal results in you becoming too powerfull and the game being too easy so dont play them at all.

SelimDemirci,"HİKAYE: ömrümde oynadığım en iyi seri witcher serisidir tabi ben 2. ve 3. oyunları oynadım. 3 oyunu daha 40 saat oynadım ama dolu dolu oynadım. her an her köşeye bakıyorsunuz her yerde detay fışkırıyor çevre şahane gerek şehirler olsun gerek orman ortamı olsun oyun sizi kendisine bağlıyor,her karakterin ayrı bir hikayesini duymak her an bir yerde bilinmeyen bir ek görev çıkması, iki insanın arasında hikayeler anlatması sizi şaşırtıyor. ben şahsen okuyabildiğin her konuşma yazılarını okumaya çalışıyorum. ormanda geziniyorsunuz her an karşınıza vahşi bir canavar çıkabiliyor veya bir geyik sürüsüne rastlayabiliyorsunuz, orman sanki siz yokkende yaşıyor. 4 mevsim fırtınalar yağmurlar güneşli havanın güzelliği de ayrı bir eser doğrusu; ayrıca ana görevler harika hazırlanmış, soluksuz oynuyorsunuz asıl güzel olan yan görevler, tek bir yan görev bile gereksiz ve saçma değil sanki yan görevler bile ana görev gibi detaylı ve hikayesi var. GRAFİKLER: ben oyunu dizüstü pc'de oynuyorum ama güçlü bir pc ve oyunu high ayarlarda oynuyorum orman ve yeşillik daha çok son bahar havasında ama fırtına efektleri ve gece ortamı karanlık oluyor, güçlü bir bilgisayarınız var ise ulatra ayarlarda çok daha iyi bir görsel alabilirsiniz ben bu konuda uzman bir fikir veremiyorum. OYNANABİLİRLİK: rpg oyunu gibi görünüyor ama aksiyon tarafı da var menüler sade ve ortalama bir kaç saatte öğreniyorsunuz, karakterinizi geliştirmek biraz kafa yoruyor. iksirler mutajenler derken biraz sorlanabiliriniz, ayrıca karakterin de geliştirilmesig erkeiyor tabi burda genelde kılıçlar ve elbiseler önemli bu kişisel eşyalar genelde yan görevlerle toplanabiliyor veya parasıyla yaptırabiliyorsunuz. yan görevleri yapın en çok ordan para geliyor haberiniz olsun. tüm eşyaları toplayıp satabileceğiniz yerler araştırın, SONSÖZ: arkadaşlar alın ve aldırın ben rpg sevmem demeyin bu oyun eğer oyun oynamayı seven bireyseniz mutlaka oynamanız gereken bir başyapıt, tek bir kusuru tek bir hatası gözüme batmadı. bitmesin diye bir çırpıda bitirmemeye çalışıyorum.",10,2018-04-24,PC,user

Loads of character customization options with the skill point system, a beautiful open world and highly immersive voice acting and sound effects to go with it(lip sync is amazing). The monsters and the lore are fantastic and really roped me in as a player, inspiring me to continue on to find out more aswell as research into various other forms of media such as the series by Andrzej Sapkowski. The DLC's Blood & Wine and Hearts of Stone are just as good as the main game and are a must have!

Unlike a lot of games the developers give you just enough to know what's going on and nothing more. it's briiliant they treat you like you've been playing the game. Not a lof of games do that anymore. The graphics are amazing, and make mosts games look like they came out in the last gen. Every tree, dog, withch, and drowner looks breath taking. The scenery, and music are epic. When I say the music is epic I MEAN EPIC. It is THE BEST soundtrack in all of gaming.

DarkBee,"CD Projekt RED - studio unique. The Poles found their own creative path, grew to the level of world famous developers and made Geralt of Rivia an equally popular hero in the gaming industry than Shepard from ""Normandy"". The Witcher 3 is no longer the ""curious Polish RPG"", which was the first part, but a real challenger for the title of ""best of the best."" The developers took the risk by adding an open world to the game. If you think about it, every ""big"" RPG now must necessarily be comfortable for those who did not play in the previous parts - it's even more important than a big game card. In The Witcher 3 it is taken into account: its history is friendly to beginners. Despite the obvious link to the previous games (after all, this is the trilogy finale), the pleasure from the passage will be received by one who immediately started with the Wild Hunt. You will be shown that these guys are a great evil, that white-haired girl named Tsiri needs to be rescued from this very evil, but with these ladies, you can probably get to sleep. By and large, this knowledge will be enough for a start, and later you can go into details - fortunately, for each character there is a separate entry in the journal, and as you pass, there will be several tasks in which Geralt aloud recalls the most important events from his life . It will also be possible to ""clarify"" the main decisions from the previous parts - do not worry about it. The world of the game is surprising. At least, how much the life here is gloomy and even dirty in all its manifestations (for some reason this is usually called ""realism"" - apparently, with my optimism it does not understand). Geralt now and again meets liars, scoundrels, drunkards - in a word, every mob, from which, apparently, still stinks of urine and other impurities. There are a lot of victims of the difficult fate: the grieving mothers, whose children were taken to the front, separated couples, and sometimes just skeletons, whose sad history has to be recognized by yellowing diaries. The atmosphere, of course, is unique - for the soul of the most ""harmless"" guy there are more dark stories than the main villain of some Dragon Age: Inquisition. And external ""decorations"" like cadaveric pits and gallows-trees only reinforce the first impression of communicating with the ""peaceful"" population. Even more striking is how simple The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt does without any pathos. Think, some kind of prediction about the destruction of the worlds. Well, yes, some mysterious horsemen of the Wild Hunt are running somewhere, leaving only horror and permafrost after them - the rest of them have no business. The world is mired in war, and mere mortals can only resign themselves and somehow live on. Everyone has their own concerns, no one is praying about the coming of the Hero, and all the bad weather, well, they will resolve themselves, probably. Even Geralt, it seems, sincerely believes that he is only trying to save Tsiri, and not the fate of the whole world. Paradox - such naivety from the protagonist in a really adult game.",10,2018-04-05,PC,user

SerkShaman,"First I want to start by saying that I liked the game and I recommend it. However the game is overrated. First the main plot has no urgency, at one point in Valen I had no idea what the main plot was, the bad guys are all dark and stuff but they never seem actually threatening. Interest points are mostly useless as well as most treasures and even weapons you get as rewards, game mechanics for tracking get boring after you use them 100 times, some quests have been written poorly by someone who does not appear to have read a book in his/her life - mostly are ok though, Skillege as an area was particularly lacking in story quality and was a pain to complete but not do to difficulty cause the game even on the hardest difficulty is incredibly easy and boss fight mechanics lack luster. I would give it 7/10 However if you play the expansions the game is totally different, it looks like a totally different team has written the quests, more mature and richer, boss fights with actual mechanic and difficulty, moral choices that made me go back and do them differently because the more I thought about them the more it made me think about what I perceive as good or bad. The expansion itself is as close to 10/10 it can be. Do to the exapnsions I would say the game is maybe 8/10.",8,2018-02-25,PC,user

This is the pinnacle of enthusiast gaming, the only game that delivers so well on major fronts and gives so much freedom to customize the rest at the same time. All major points that you cannot tweak like the story or world construction are greatly developed, providing great baseline, and the rest is up to you with support for basically anything, modding, .ini tweaking, different resolutions and configurations, anything you want. If there is anything about the game you don't like, and there are certainly some major flaws like very poor default alchemy system, you just customize it. If you want to push it to the limits with visuals, you can do it. All of this support and tweakability makes half of the game, this is the very reason why this game stands out so much.

The combat movement is fine, but sometimes my block/parry doesn't register. The story is great, but suffers from strange pacing and between 10-20 hours in I kept thinking about quitting. Mainly at the point where it forced me to do about six side-quests to continue. Once I got past that the story picked up and never slowed down. Its a really great game and I can't wait to see more from CDPR, I just hope they can fix the minor flaws.",8,2018-01-17,PC,user
Howmaster,"This is the best open world RPG ever created and it is one of the best RPG’s ever. I simply loved almost everything about this game. Time Invested: 150 hours (and just started Blood and Wine Exp.) Story/Characters: In comparison to Witcher 2, the main story here is actually pretty unsophisticated and straightforward. However, it is so well written that it is extremely enjoyable. Additionally, the side missions and witcher contracts have great detail and fun. What really makes this game great is the writing and characters. All of your favorite characters return with the introduction of Ciri who you immediately like. It’s the depth and details given to these characters that create these remarkable interactions with Geralt and the player. The writing is stellar and creates the suspension of disbelief that you need to get into this world. Gameplay: I felt that the gameplay here, besides the UI, was largely unchanged from Witcher 2. The biggest change is the UI and it’s a huge improvement as menus and screens are easy to navigate. I thought that loading in this game was almost non-existent, it was great! I could start the game and bam within a minute I was playing. I rarely encountered any bugs as well. My only complaint is that combat is still a little clunky. Sometimes you can find yourself just swinging your sword wildly all over at the air or there is a delay in dodging or rolling. Combat is still fun, but it may be the weakest part of this game especially since it does nothing new. Graphics/Sound: Crazy beautiful; the environment is absolutely stunning! You can easily get lost traveling/exploring which is the best part of an open world RPG. I loved all of the music, but as with some other games that have amazing music, can we please hear it more often!? Sometimes I am out roaming the hills and a tune would be nice. Conclusion: Overall this is was/is one of the most enjoyable experiences I have had playing an RPG. The characters, graphics, lore, music, and story are all fantastic. This is definitely a new benchmark for all RPG’s. If you enjoy adventure, RPG, or just video games in general, this is a must own.",10,2018-01-16,PC,user

zevl12,"I had this game refunded because i did not enjoy it at all. I was about 5 hours in when i decided to give up. The first aspect that hits you and never lets go is being bogged down with heavy story unraveling at a slow pace. It references parts in previous games which i have not played without explaining it ( early on at least ), the story was so ungripping and boring to follow and did not let me immerse myself in it at all just felt like a infinite wheel of perpetual filler. Just full of dull ordinary this and that dialogue with an underpinned ""Find this important character in the end trope"", lending itself to be percieved as if you are under somewhat constant urgency. One of the main characters himself proclaiming you are here to find and bring a person to him as fast as possible, making me feel uncomfortable doing side quests involving you to stray from this, as if i wasn't supposed to do them. Everyone in dialogue references lore characters, places, factions etc making it sound like they are saying something interesting but in reality they are just spouting heavy words with no impact or good story driven writing. ""Oh the lord of superawesome city in the battle of long forgotten dragon in the quest for greater divinity"", who cares tell me something that gets me engaged. The story basically has nothing unique or well delivered going for it, it makes you feel as a block of text inside concept art description. Combat is a little enticing but in the end very basic and not satisfactory, sometimes you can do some good dodges and attack in a way that feels a little rewarding mixing it up with some cool spells. But in the end its just about mashing the dodge button a lot and strike a few times. I have a lot more to complain about, how things such as the witcher sense that you use to be a detective is such a lame mechanic that does not add anything to the game. On rails open world, everything is laid out for you, barely feel like you are playing the game just watching. How being a witcher might work in a narrative driven game where you dont really carve your own path (which is what this game is), but it still makes you out to be a non distinct super mutant that kills things for money with a neutral stance. Making me feel like a mix of ""i am my own character and no i am a witcher"" this balance is so annoying and i feel lost to who i am.",5,2018-01-12,PC,user
DGPony,"I feel like a terrible cheapskate, only picking this up including expansions for around 20 euro's in 2018. I always wanted to play it but was occupied wearing out some other releases for quite some time and felt a bit saturated with fantasy settings. Needles to say that 20 bucks is an unbelievable amount of value for money. I played the original Witcher, back in the days and one of the best improvements is the open world. But where many other AAA games also succeed in creating vast, believable open worlds, The Witcher 3 stands out in also backing that world up with content that is just as varied and fleshed out. Memorable gaming moments galore and you never know what to expect around the next corner. Also your choices really matter. Many developers promise that, but few deliver. Combined with some of the best writing I ever saw in my gaming life (no catering for 'all ages' and/or dumbwits here) my only gripes feel like pet peeves: could use more intuitive character control and out leveling items quickly means getting upgrades or crafting them is less of a rewarding experience.

buzzlighter,"An absolute marvel! No open world rpg to the date comes anywhere close to this one. Strongest point of the game is the amount of content in the world. You can clearly see that devs were really fans of the game themselves. Minor details, which are like a litmus test for the depth of the game, are immense. Simple world exploration is incredibly exciting. While the main quest line is just good, secondary quests are awesome (incl. treasure hunts and witcher's contracts). Combat system is loads of fun. I remember cutting a foe in half in a fight on the bridge, just to watch his lower half tripped and fall off the bridge. Spending minutes in a spot on a map, mesmerized by the spectacular view, is no stranger in this world either. My personal favorite is the way light glows in a distance from windows during darkness. Still remember that stormy evening I first saw Novigrad walls from a distance. In fact, I have so many on such small but precious memories from this game. Nothing but love to the devs for it. I think I might buy this game once more, just out of immense appreciation. Oh and almost forgot, the game is very well optimized, which is a unique achievement in modern times by itself. A few flaws exits, however. First and for most is the jerky movement controls outside of battle, which sometimes make even simple tasks a challenge. It is a common problem arising from a console ported game. Also, on occasion, the weapon auto-draw system made me curse out loud. But on the grande scale of things, the flaws are irrelevant. This game is a solid competitor for the best game ever made.",9,2017-12-21,PC,user

First of all it's a story, for someone who have played previous game it's very disappointing how little decision matters, and at some point(especially in the final) the game is trying to be too epic. Combat System should be more expanded, skill tree isn't good, there are so much useless ability in there. But you know what? It doesn't matter. The Story and Combat System are still very good, but they are the reason why i can't give this game 10/10.

steelcl,"I got aboard the hype train and bought my first Witcher game. At first, even though i felt the combat was repetitive and uninspired, the map exploration and atmosphere of the game really got me excited and I expected the combat, story and quests to improve along the playthrough. So I've started exploring the small events in the map and the side quests. Those were a bit amusing, but nothing better than what it's possible to experience in any average RPG. Still, it was a pain in the butt that the game forces me to use those impractical and uninspired spells to defeat some specific monsters. Then, I went to the main quests, and I got extremely annoyed by the favor-for-a-favor element that guides you to endure unmeaningful tasks to move on through the story. Finally, when you get to the big city, my motivation to keep playing got absolutely destroyed, because of the lack of things to do there. I really tried but I can't feel any emotion for any character of this game due to the boring main plot. To finish it, I even skipped some cut-scenes because everything got really tiresome. I was expecting something like Dragon Age or even better, but you can hardly interact with any npc in the game, outside of the quests and those boring dialogues without meaningful options, which makes it hard to get emotionally involved.",4,2017-11-22,PC,user

The story is engaging; Even the side quests have unexpected twists or morally difficult choices that have an impact on the world around you. Not all the stories have happy endings, but that's ok, because they all leave a mark on you -- an experience to bring with you on the road ahead. The Witcher 3 is able to show the despair of a world tormented by war, famine and monsters, while also giving a glimpse of hope. There are plenty of monsters and demons in this game, all with different traits and behaviours. Some beasts require a lot of planning and detective work prior to the fight. This is exciting, because it builds up the curiosity of what you might be up against. I love this game, and it delivered above my expectations at the time.

MR67,"In my opinion, probably the best PC RPG released since Dragon Age Origins nearly 10 years ago now (though I haven't yet played Divinity Original Sin 2!). I was not a fan of the first two games in this series, but I think the developers have made this game a lot more accessible for newcomers to the series. If I have to compare this to its closest competitor, Dragon Age Inquisition, it's superior in just about every way. The story is way more interesting, the quests and side quests more involving, the combat more fluid and enjoyable, the graphics are better, the cut scenes, voice acting and animations are more polished, and the world environment more immersive. Does Dragon Age Inquisition have weather effects for example? Or day/night cycles? Or even children running around in the towns and villages? Nope. Finishing moves in combat? Nope. An addictive, in-game card game you can play? Nope. The only real criticisms I have of this game are that there are still some minor bugs - graphical glitches such as two merchants or horses standing in the same space, items floating in midair, and peasants carrying non-existent crates around, or the occasional exit to Windows. I felt DAI, in this regard, was more bug free. Also, for some strange reason, the developers disabled the jump option in combat by replacing it with a sideways dodge instead, so you can literally be trapped in a corner surrounded by enemies because there is a low fence in front of you which you cannot jump over! And, there is no auto-walk or run option, so if you are travelling either on foot, or by boat, or on horseback, you have to hold down the movement key/controller button if you want to go anywhere when you're not using the fast travel option. The loot system is also a little underwhelming, as the game makes use of lots of crafting for gear, potions and oils, so most of the stuff you find will be crafting components such as string, diamond dust or various monster body parts. There is also still quite a steep learning curve, particularly for the combat. Conclusion - if you enjoy action RPGs and haven't already got this game, what are you waiting for? Get the Game of the Year edition which comes with all DLC included. This was recently discounted at 60% for an entire week to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Witcher series, but should still be available at a reduced price, seeing it was originally released in 2015.",9,2017-11-06,PC,user

andreyjmco,"I remeber playing Witcher 2 on it's release and just giving up after 20 some hours and never touching again. I remeber playing Witcher 3 on it's release and just giving up after 5 hours to play Madden Ultimate Team. And get highly frustrated to let this masterpiece go in exchange of a pay-to-win multiplayer. At first, The Witcher 3 gets you by hand and teaches you the basics of combat. During the tutorial, you suddenly see there is a lot of options in combat to use, but i kept myself in the melee style. After completing the White Orchard tutorial, it just lets you go. ""Go on, do whatever you wish"". This is where i got lost. Did not know how to start and started dying after trying to beat some higher leveled monsters. When i came back to the game, in early 2016, i decided to follow the main quest. To never regret. The socio-political tone of the story drags you into the world of The Witcher. It makes you understand why stuff happen in the game, making you feel the dimensional difference between ordinary characters you'll find in the villages and cities (lots of them) and the main characters in the game (witcher, sorcerers, monsters, etc.). It makes you accomplish amazing magical stuff like travel through dimensions and at the same time ordinary village tasks like chase a goat. I kept going on and back between these dimensional differences and it made the game feel good to play. Combat IS SO MUCH BETTER than it was in The Witcher 2. Can't compare. It gives you options to choose between what kind of combat you'll adhere to. You can upgrade signs and burn enemies, take control of their minds or stun them with magic. Or you can master the swordsmanship and adapt you game to a counter-attack/melee approach to the enemies. You just choose. The variety of weapons and armor in the game is also a great point. You'll switch between a lot of them, until the very end of the game, when you'll probably find the ones to match your combat style. Just be patient. Soundtrack is amazing. Makes you really feel in the medieval era and sets the tone of the game in calm, action and cutscenes. ""Wolven Storm"" is a beautiful original soundtrack even in different languages, just check on YouTube. Don't forget to play both the DLC's. They're both amazing stories by themselves, bringing much more content than you'll ever imagined. I played this game on main quest, new game plus, the Heart of Stone DLC and the Blood and Wine DLC in a total of 488 hours and actually got SAD it ended. Until i've played this, Ocarina of Time was considered to be the best game ever created (and i've played hundreds of games since 1998). It just lost it's crown to The Witcher 3. Absolute masterpiece.",10,2017-10-27,PC,user

Even with much better combat and combat animations this game isn't close to 10/10 because of other problem like borign talents and items, finding legendary items is like very underwhelming. Tho main story has quality side quests are overrated, I've heard a lot of about side quests but kinda like in kindoms of amalur it's few big side quests and rest is meh.

gun661,"Rating The Witcher 3 seems quite difficult. I have the utmost respect for all the work that went into this game. It contains a moderate amount of great ideas and fun content that seems personal and passionate, which is a true gift to gamers nowadays considering the excel-sheet game-design of current ""AAA""-titles. But those fun pieces are overshadowed by design decisions that throw them into a melange that, at least in my opinion, is pretty much drab and humdrum. The sum is less than it's parts. In the end, I couldn't get myself to finish the game despite trying several times. The Good: - Astonishing level-art, great models and textures (Novigrad is frickin' massive) - Witty episodes in-between (returning a goat; herding pigs; rock trolls; some dialogues) - Quest design being tied to story elements; solving mysteries. The Disputed - Story: Overall, its tone, atmosphere, and mentality seemed more in accordance with (the popular) ""Games of Thrones"" than with the spirit of its own subject. My guess is: that's the reason why this game is so popular: so ""dark"", so ""grown up"". Therefore the game's story is a grimdark succession of tragedy after tragedy. Tragedy no matter what. Why? Because of drama. Want to save children? Then other children will die. Want to be diplomatic? Can't be, everyone's corrupt. Want to survive? Kill or be killed. It's this monotonous ""human nature is **** "" and all around edginess (""you gotta be a dirtbag yourself"") that's now copied by every major player in the media industry, be it television, films or games... smells like teen spirit. Yes, there also was one such tragic quest-line in the Witcher 2, a game I really liked, but that's the difference: If you repeat this concept again and again and make it your one trick pony, it gets artificial and melodramatic. Besides, while the concept of neutrality was a really interesting topic in the books and also the first 2 games, in the third game Geralt's options to act neutral seemed reduced to Geralt behaving like a stone-cold mercenary, a calculating entrepeneur, regrettably. The Witcher novels, as far as I remember, manage a nuanced balance of ""dark"" and ""light"" content. At it's core they also convey a lot of gritty humour, sober human warmth and friendship, exciting (i.e. NOT depressing) adventures and tales, and a lot of eroticism (there even was a testimonial from Playboy magazine on the back of the first book). In Comparison, humour, adventure, friendship, and eroticism became a minor aspect of the Witcher 3, whereas the grimdark gore and edginess went into overdrive. Alas, it's also the reason I couldn't really get into the story, I'm no fan of GoT and its grimdark dramatically dramatic drama. The Bad - Stuff to do all over the place: What to do with the (literal) hundreds of ""points of interests"", and how to react to the (literal) tens of thousands lootable herbs all over the place? When and what to gather? Gather them at all? Is it worthwhile? I'd say: No. You thought Zelda BotW's krog seeds were a completionists nightmare, well, you haven't seen this. - How to get to all these places? The game is designed in a way that the only efficient method to get to places is looking at the mini-map and following the dotted line leading you to your next spot or quest. While the scenery you walk or ride through is nice, it's just that: scenery, empty scenery. I wonder how much time players have spend looking at that dotted line on the mini-map. I wish there was an eye-tracking study about this. - There's so many ""NPCs"". But except story NPCs and merchants, you can't interact with any of them, which seems kinda odd. There's whole villages with no NPCs to talk to, just ""models"" walking around. The term ""NPC"" is misleading in this case, it's more like ""bots"" or just part of the non-interactive scenery, like trees. - Loot. Generic, random loot everywhere. Besides the witcher gear quests, there's no ""artifacts"" or truly special items to discover. - All of this adds up to: Aside from the story quests there's no real discoveries to be made, no feeling of adventure, no real incentive to explore the open world. And while I do not know the look and location of many villages in this game or the nooks and crannies of Novigrad, I remember the layout of the mini map quite well. - Combat and moving around the world. There are a lot of other reviews that already cover this topic in all its particulars. Summary / tl;dr: If you're a fan of GoT-style stories, don't mind spectating Geralt's dot as it travels around the minimap to your next story dialogue, and fancy your combat to be rolling and pirouetting, than there's some fun to be had with The Witcher 3 and some beautiful sceneries to be seen.",5,2017-10-17,PC,user

AkumaJack,"This is a must play for quite everyone. Here's a list of pro and cons and then a more ""in depth"" review. PRO: +Huge world in which you can roam around freely +Build variety is on top, you can play the game in a lot of different ways +Quest and story are good and intresting +TONS of content. I've just finished the main game and it took me around 70+ hours. I havent completed all sidequests, or contracts or the DLCs (that i heard are extremely good and long) +Gwent Cons: -It is too easy maybe So, the review. The Witcher 3 is an open world action rpg and it is extremely good at both. First the open world part: You'll get something like 3 major areas in which you can go exploring and when i say three think about each one of them like the entire map of Fallout 3 or something like that. Every area has it's own ecosystem, its enviroment and its tradition. And in this huge, good looking and realistic map you'll have ALWAYS something to do because it is litterally filled with point of interest like hidden treasures or monsters caves and so on. I think you could easily spend 5 hours completing the PoI just of the prologue area (that is the smaller). And it is quite useful to do that because you'll get loot (swords, formulas ecc.) and EXP while fighting monsters gives you something like 1xp point per kill. Now for the Action part: The game is fast paced, especially if you go for a fast attack build like i did. You'll be spamming the right click every second. It is fun, there are a lot of non human enemies and unique bosses / minibosses. The problem is it can get quite to easy if you do every sidequest/contract and level up or if you use sick combos that can brake the game. Also it rarely forces you to really think about what to do in fights since you usually fights the same kind of enemy in every encounter and rarely different kinds in the same fight. Still quite fun because you have a lot of options at your disposal: attacks (both fast and heavy), signs, bombs, potions and so on. And last the RPG part: Is fantastic. One of the best thing of the game. Almost EVERY choice you take will change something sooner or later. I completed a quest in the begging just to discover 30 hours later that i could use the ending of that quest to convince an NPC to help because i was good.

Robobob,"After playing through some more Witcher 3 after a total new PC build, I changed my review. Great game now that Geralt is a little more responsive with more PC power. He still has some of the worst controls of any game I've played in awhile with keyboard mouse or controller. Try and get him to move one step forward. Go ahead and try. It's nearly impossible. Try and get him to stand still while attacking. Like just take a swipe or a swing or something while standing still. Also impossible. He leaps around like a wounded duck during combat. Weird and a step back in the genre when games like Assassin Creed and Shadows of Mordor give you near perfect control. The graphics may be the best I've seen in any game. However, why are the trees constantly blowing like an F3 hurricane is moments from hitting land. Yeah it's cool that all of the trees and shrubs move dynamically like that. But all day and night during even sunny weather? Chill, devs, chill. I love that when you hunt monsters, each target is a completely different creature with its own lore, strengths and weaknesses. Those fights are usually the most exciting. Gwent is a really simple card game where collecting the cards can be kind of addicting at first, but remember you are on a time sensitive mission to save your daughter/friend/girl. No time for that stuff . Mission tracking is very helpful. No time wasted searching for quest locations. There's lots to find exploring the map. Once you are a few levels higher than your mission requirements the game becomes easy as pie, as is the case with most RPGs. The signs the witcher can use in combat are mostly useless and I usually win most of my fights with dodging and striking at the right time or ya know.... flopping around like a wounded duck. ;) Fun, beautiful game, but not as ground breaking as people claim.",8,2017-09-26,PC,user

I played MMOs like WOW, ESO, Guildwars and this game blows it out of the water in terms of story line. This game is a lot better than the Elder Scrolls series such as Morrowind or Skyrim. The graphics on this game is so good that you will still be able to recommend this game to your friends even years after release. I didn't play it until the GOTY edition came out. They have updated UI as well as how you organize your items. The world feels so alive. I can't recommend it enough.

gloriouspotato,"You know those games where upon finishing it, you kind of just sit back in your chair and feel sad and nostalgic because you don't know what to do with your life anymore? Well, the Witcher 3 is one of those games. No other game I've ever played has brought together such an immersive and authentic dark fantasy world. The visuals, the soundtrack, the various locales, fantastic writing and characterisation and all the little stories, both comedic and tragic, scattered across the world of the Witcher make for quite the gaming experience. I do have a few minor criticisms such as Eredin being a weak antagonist, and some other game elements which I feel could be improved, but there's no broad aspect of the game that I can say is outright bad or mediocre. Everything in the Witcher has been treated with utmost care and it really shows. Prior to playing the Witcher 3, I would also highly recommend playing through the previous Witcher games, as there are many references you will otherwise not understand, and you will come to appreciate (or despise) certain characters more. While these can be recapped and explained to you through the in-game glossary, a short blurb is simply no comparison to the character development built up in two 40-hour games that came before. Overall rating - 9.2/10",9,2017-07-16,PC,user
Tiago_Vieira,"É provavelmente o melhor jogo já lançado e o RPG modelo para adultos. Por que para adultos? Bom, porque há tramas complexas, eventos que simulam fatos históricos medievais e não histórias muito fantásticas dos vários RPG's que temos por aí. Quando se fala que um RPG é medieval, por exemplo, eu esperava que houvesse algo realmente - historicamente falando - que me lembrasse a Idade Média, porém a maioria dos RPG's me pareceu fantasioso demais e sem nenhuma conexão história... mas The Witcher mudou isto. Recomendo a todos aqueles que procuram uma história bem séria e adulta. Prós: Gráficos lindos. História incrível. Personagens muito marcantes. Protagonista marcante demais. Trilha sonora espetacular. Centenas de horas BEM gastas. Missões secundárias maravilhosas. Contras: O final não é exatamente a soma de suas decisões do jogo inteira, mas de algumas decisões nas últimas dezenas de horas do jogo.",10,2017-07-13,PC,user
ZeroIbanez,"Very few games deserve the title of ""gaming changer"", and The Witcher 3 is one of those. This game is an absolute masterpiece of the RPG genre, and is the new golden standard of the genre, i will explain you why: first off, in these days, that are a lot of RPGs, but very few of them seem to understand what makes an RPG an RPG, and that is ROLEPLAY, yes it's pretty self explanatory, rpgs should always have roleplay, otherwise it's not an RPG, and that is: you need to make choices as the character, and not only as the player, and those changes need to have a tangible impact in the world around you, and on the characters, and Witcher 3 masters this, your choices have imediate and long term effects, so you have to choose carefully how you'll conduct yourself. Next topic is story, and it is very good, they take a simple premise, which is finding your long lost adopted daughter Ciri, and protecting her from an otherwordly threat that is pursuing her and they expand it to a degree of complexity with the side stories Geralt will be caught in, and the numerous mishaps in the way, that it's simply amazing. The world of the Witcher 3 is to put it simply, a masterpiece on it's own, it's the best open-world i've ever seen, it's huge, but it feels so organic and full of life, that you'll feel very, very immerse into it. The game also has one of the best cast of characters you'll ever see in a video-game, each one with it's unique and rich backstory, which, by the way, is part of the vast lore of the game. The combat is simple, but engrossing, as a witcher, Geralt has a plethora of combat choices, and an arsenal at his disposal: you have light attacks, heavy attacks, your crossbow, bombs at your disposal, magical signs, potions, decoctions, etc. all these elements combined, make for one of the most interesting combat mechanics to feature in an action-rpg. I could spend much more time listing the games pros, and believe me that are many, the only con i've ever faced in this game are some of it's bugs, but nothing game breaking was experienced by me. IMHO, this game is the best rpg games in years, and alogside another masterpiece which is Pillars of Eternity, it carries the banner of other juggernauts of the genre, such as Baldur's Gate II, Planescape Torment and Gothic 2, it is one of those games that every gamer must play, and if you're an rpg fan and haven't played this game yet, what's wrong with you? get it asap!",10,2017-07-09,PC,user

Chadpowers,"Graphics: 10/10 Not much to say here, it's basically the best practice for this genre. Sound: 5/10 Not bad. Not good. Overall Quite forgettable. At least decent SFX. Gameplay: 3/10 This one is really hard to judge, since the player will spend 50% of his time watching cutscenes and 45% following markers on the map. The other 5% the player will frantically spam light attacks and stunlock every enemy to death. The pretty animations brilliantly hide the fact that the combat system couldn't be any more simplistic and free of any kind of challenge. The Character of Geralt is already overpowered at the start of the game, as someone who is stronger than any human or monster and a master of Swordfighting, Crossbows, Magic and with superhuman strength and endurance. Not only is the character stronger than everything in the game by lore, also will he not change a thing about the gameplay for the whole game - there is no feeling of progression whatsoever, it's fast attack spam for 100% of the fights. Also enemies respawn and scale, making the huge, but stale world even more static. The combat itself is worth about 1 point and the other activities in the game also are worth a single point. Even the crafting system doesn't really score, since the items the players gets from that don't matter compared to what he can get from other sources and faster and easier at that. At least the game has a lot of content, which nets a third point. But what good is a huge world like that if it's filled with only meaningless activities in and between following map markers? Story: 8/10 Story in the witcher is very polarizing. Some people love it, other people hate it. The plot itself certainly isn't as epic as one would expect and the overpowered nature of the main character really leaves very little room for actual surprises. Personally I dislike everything about the characters, the plot and most of the dialogues. However, everything adheres to high standards - just not everyones standards - and the overall quality and detail are extremely good. As per usual for most games though, the story loses drive after the first area and stays comparatively underwhelming for most of the middle of the game, where the underwhelming gameplay is much more noticeable, so that's -2 points. Summary: 6/10 The game can be a 10/10 for people that love cutscenes - but then a movie might be a better investment. A more realistic scoring would be either 6 or 7 out of 10, depending on how much one is bothered by the cutscenes and the follow the marker gameplay. That score might seem low, but if one looks past the fancy graphics and sex scenes, the game really has very little to offer in terms of actual player interaction with the world and gameplay, which is after all the core ****.",6,2017-06-19,PC,user

FourEyedGeek,"It has been written before, but this game is amazing. It sets the bar for future open world games and RPGs at a very high standard. The story is enticing and the quests well thought out, every side quest is worthwhile. It is beautiful, not just for the graphics but the aesthetics, it feels alive. The city buildings are beautiful, the countryside is enchanting. The meat of every game is the game play mechanics, I feel that Witcher 3 finally got it right. The melee combat being different between monsters and humans, is great, while using the Bestiary to find out enemies weaknesses before a challenging encounter and utilizing the right equipment keeps it interesting. The spells, potions and bombs really add to the variation and challenge. Even at the hardest levels, combat was not too difficult when you took each encounter seriously but deadly if you just walked in without a plan. The developers should feel proud, and the accolades are well deserved.",10,2017-06-13,PC,user

Draconis13,"I hope this has not set a new standard for RPGs in the future, because this is a sorry excuse for an RPG. I keep getting bored of this game, even though I'm really trying to like it, and I'm extremely jealous of everyone who loves this game so much more than I do. The game play is terrible, everything about it is a terrible atrocity of RPG game play. The equipment doesn't matter. Better armor, weapons etc. has no affect on game play, and in 99% of RPGs getting better equipment is the only reason for exploring. Not to mention this game has the least amount of dynmanics and replayability of any RPG I have encountered. You can only use 1 weapon type, a sword, 2 if you count the useless crossbow you will never use. And there's 5 spells, OH well maybe given how highly rated The DLC is they released 2 more spells with each one. So that would give it a grand total of 9 spells, I can tell they put so much work into this **** people say this gameplay is like Dark Souls, yeah it's like Dark Souls if you remove 10 out of the 11 possible attack types, 198 out of 199 weapons, and 200 out of the 208 spells. Then it's like Dark Souls. Even if equipment had an effect on gameplay, it wouldn't matter, because you could beat this game naked at level 1. This is the easiest RPG I've ever played, and the easiest adventure game I've played since Assassin's Creed 2. For me, the immersion of Dark Fantasy monster hunting comes from the constant fear that you will stumble across an epic abomination that will sodomize you into oblivion. In the Witcher 3, the hardest fight is the tutorial boss, because you are still learning the controls. After that the game is as hard as winning a nose picking contest against earthworms. If a 4 year-old can slay a dragon on this game, the immersion of risky and intense monster hunting is completely ruined. The world is also quite disappointing. Given how much better people like this world than Dragon Age Inquisition, I was expecting this to be much more spectacular, but visually it's nothing but a major step down from Inquisition. Velen is all 1 environment of endless acreage of bland tree copses and villages that were copy+pasted 100 times over. the environment and the scenery never changes. The story is the only reason to play it, that and Gwent. Overall this is an OK game and the story is good enough that I plan to story mode speed run this game at some point, but for now I've grown too bored of the game play. Pros: Gwent: 10/10 Story: 10/10 Cons: Gameplay: 0/10 worst of any RPG I have played. This makes Witcher 1 look like Dark Souls. World: 6/10 -not bad but greatly preceded by its reputation. Overall: 6/10 A decent game but largely overrated. I hope to God this doesn't become the game play standard for RPGs in the future.",6,2017-06-03,PC,user
SteelSoapy,"I don't do game reviews. But, finished this game and am surprised to have only a 93 metascore...when the top metascore for a PC game at this time is a 96, this shows how highly I think of this game, and how much I enjoyed playing through it. One of the best single player games of all time...period. To give you a background, I have been playing video games for 18 years a this point, and have played and enjoyed all types of games, but mostly enjoy online first-person shooters. Before that, I enjoyed single player games like Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and a bunch of MMORPG's. Mass Effect, Skyrim, and Fallout great...I never enjoyed the first Dragon Age and thus stopped playing. But, man...just going through this game and being immersed by stepping into the shoes of Geralt, this game blew my mind. Mentally and emotionally. Graphics. Combat (good enough), Mods, Sounds, Immersion, characters, story, plot, twists, etc. Just wow!

Arroyo_man,"Sorry for my English but im lazy old fart who doesnt want to learn any more :P So, I don't think i like anything about this game. At first i think immersion in this game is a joke. You are coming in to people's houses and steel all the food, booze and other valuable equipped right from their noses. It's just ridiculous! They should at least react somehow to that. Even good old Gothic has been done better about this. Being a Medieval-Batman isn't that fun either. Geralt is just too perfect, with no faults whatsoever. It just feels so fake and maybe it is the reason it was so hard for me to like him. Besides, you can't be anyone you want here. You are being you sitting on your butt and creating Geralt's legend and his ego. I don't think it is what RPGs are about. The story itself, that supposed to be the strongest part of this game, is jut meh. Geralt is looking for his so-called daughter, and at som point when her realize that Wild hunt is after her, insed of freaking out he's got time for taking 1182151/!@#""!%1 witcher contracts, wiping out all that monster nests (even not being paid for that which is wrong story-wise), doing stupid fetch quests etc. Bah! He even goes to vineyards to have a lazy nap. It's just perfectly average story, badly balanced where you can totally lost the interest of it. The fact the game tells you exactly where to go and what to do doesn't help, it just makes it mindless slasher at some point. The graphics are OK but the landscapes doesn't feel that good. The woods are so shaky, artificial and dead (except being filled in with monsters), it doesn't feel any good exploring it. In W1 & W2 everything was so unique and looked nice, made with attention to details. Here we have copy-paste boring villages with some copy-paste villagers that all look the same except different clothing. Honestly, sandbox style just doesnt fit Witcher setting at all. Obviously, the combat. It just not accurate enough. You can be hit by enemy being few meters away. Besides that, all fights comes to dodging and repetitive slashing from behind. Throw some Quen barrier and you are ready to go for entire game. Conversations are taking ages. They should be more brief, like in Dark Souls for example, where all the dialogues was live and you could quit them just simply moving out from that character. How immersive was that! Here we are forced to watch how people breath, when they sit, thinking about something pause etc. It's just so overdone, make no sense like eating a hot dog and having champagne with it. Even more because there is no philosophical content in their speeches. Its all very shallow here (nothing to do for Planescape Torment fans). Music is the only thing i have no complains about. Absolutely not a game for me, i love the classic rpgs above all, so if you are a fan of those you might feel bit disappointed (or a little bit more than that).",4,2017-05-27,PC,user
Guinness,"Nearly perfect game - 9.5 I have been PC gamer for over 25years, and I would say this is one of the best game execution that I have had privilege to play. There are few items which tarnish the perfect score, but even those are very settle. I will mention them here: constrained movement control can be very annoying, especially while in combat, Skellige map and quests being somewhat bland, lack of actual night and low visibility, lack of FOV adjustment, and few quests being glitched. Otherwise, this game has really pushed the bar in terms of visuals, story, and immersion. Sadly, it still dominates even 2 years after it release. it is important as gamers and customers, that we award games like Witcher III as exceptional, in order to promote this expectation for the future games. Giving the game low score, just because the genre is incompatible with ones expectation, does not help. Witcher III is a complete execution of state of the art graphics, animation, sound and story. Something that cannot be said for even some of the newest titles, like MA: Andromeda. Kudos to CD Projekt, and I hope they continue this level of commitment and determination toward its customers. P.S. to rate this game as ""without story behind"" is like saying Lord of The Rings is story about killing monsters and throwing a ring into the volcano. Which in both case would be Correct but very Flawed observation. Not all ""?"" should have the meaningful story, and player should certainly not pursue each one of them if they dont want to. Plenty of other contents available.",10,2017-05-24,PC,user
TomasOlsson,This is the best game i have ever played! I started a Metacritic account just so i could give this game a 10. The story is amazing. I've never felt so emotional playing a game before. The open world is beautiful. The action is fast-paced and satisfying. Please CD Projekt Red: Make a Witcher 4! :-D,10,2017-05-23,PC,user

Ciristan,"Visualmente es espectacular, solo tienes que ver las imágenes, los vídeos. Todo esto acompañado de una banda sonora perfecta para cada una de las instancias en la que estés. El argumento es fascinante. Aparte de la línea central del juego hay montones de misiones secundarias con un trasfondo digno de ser una historia principal. Tal es la riqueza de contenido que disfrutarás con cada misión que se te presente. Sobre la jugabilidad es buena. Te aconsejo jugar el juego en la máxima dificultad para hacerlo más desafiante y así tengas que prepararte antes de pelear. Por ejemplo aplicando aceites para espada, bebiendo pociones, leyendo sobre las debilidades del enemigo, etc.. De esta forma explotarás todos estos aspectos que tiene el juego para las batallas. El rendimiento es fluido, si tienes una buena computadora no tendrás problemas. Sobre el mundo enorme. Hay punto de interés a lo largo de todos los mapas. Si quieres completar el juego de forma detallada y con la dificultad máxima, te das el tiempo de leer todas las entradas y te gusta jugar gwynt, tienes para mínimo, pero mínimo 200 horas (sin considerar las expansiones). Conclusión: Uno de los mejores juegos que he jugado en mi vida (por no decir que es el mejor).",10,2017-05-09,PC,user

LIIMAonMcritic,"What can I say, I won't even bother to review any other games but this game and its developers deserve it. I have played this game through 3 times now and have something like 300-400 hours put in to it and I haven't encountered many bugs, in fact I can't remember any right now, I'm sure there has been couple small ones but nothing major. The combat is amazing! Its very responsive and the animations are top notch, it also isn't too hard for new players (except for couple boss fights). For better players it offers options to execute the combat more efficiently, quickly and with style. And its not just slashing swords around, you can also use these abilities called signs which introduce a whole new layer to the combat. For example one is called Aard, its a telekinetic wave which pushes the enemy backwards. There's so much different enemies and enemy types too. Graphics look very good. Some textures look different from what other games are usually offering in terms of style, water for example, I've never seen that style water in any other game but I think it looks absolutely amazing! Forests are very dense without any frame drops unlike most other games, which usually only have a few trees and bushes. No complaints in this part either. The map is very large and it has been done very well. It doesn't feel empty at any point. It feels much more larger than many other game maps because you have to travel by walking, on a horse or in some cases on a boat. There is a large amount of different loot and different swords, armors, armor sets etc. And the Blood and Wine expansion pack even introduced some customization for them. I guess I could mention here that the skill tree system has also been done very well and introduces new tactics into combat as well. Story is one of the best selling points for this game. You can jump in to this game even if you haven't played the previous games or haven't read the books and the story will still **** you in. However there might be some references you might not get if you don't play the previous games or read the books. I personally only played Witcher 2 before this game and now because of Witcher 3 I will read the books because the story is just that amazing, and I NEVER read books. My only negative thing to say about this game is that it has not been ported to Linux.",10,2017-04-24,PC,user

Oyunun grafikleri oldukça güzel yapılmış.Bunların biri kullanılan renk paleti kalitesi renkler ne gözleri yoruyor ne de rahatsız ediyor oldukça güzel renk paleti kullanılmış.Grafiklerin doku kalitesi oldukça kaliteli yapılmış ve karakter tasarımları çok başarılı olmuş bunun yanında fizik hareketleri de oldukça yeterli düzeyde yapılmış.Çevre kalitesi oldukça güzel yapılmış ve rüzgar efekti oldukça kaliteli yapılarak bizlere rüzgar varmış hissini iyi aktarmışlar.Yağmur efekti de oldukça doyurucu olmuş resmen oynarken sağanak yağış varmış gibi bize aktarmayı başarmışlar.Sisli bölgeler de ise durum yine aynı sisli bölgeyi gördüğünüzde oraya gitmeye çekiniyorsunuz ve bu sisli havadaki duyguları da bizde hissettirmeyi başarılı bir şekilde aktarmışlar.Grafikler 10/10 Ses Seslerde pek diyecek bir şey bir çok ortamda kullanılan ses efekleri oldukça başarılı **** gittiğiniz yerlerde ortama göre ses efekti aktarılmış ve diyaloglardaki konuşma sesleri ve onun beraber karakterin ağız hareketleri oldukça birbirine uyumlu hazırlanmış.Müziklere diyecek bir şey yok olağan üstü harika müzikler hazırlanmış. Ses 10/10 Oynanabilirlik Oyunu oynamak oldukça kolay olmuş yani oyun sizi yormuyor ve oynamaktan zevk alıyorsunuz.Karakter geliştirme özellikleri oldukça güzel hazırlanmış ve seviye atladıkça karakterinizi geliştirmek için 1 puan kazanıyorsunuz.Bunun dışında Haritada bulunan soru işaretli olan yerlerde seviye atlamadan sizlere karakterinizi geliştirmek için puan veren ve büyü yeteneklerinizi güçlendiren ayin taşları mevcut bunları bulup etkileşime girdiğinizde size hem karakter için puan hemde yeteneklerinizi güçlendiren buff kazanıyorsunuz.Karakteriniz için geliştirmeniz gereken sadece seviye değil bazı setler ve silahlarda mevcut bu silahları ve zırhları soru işaretli olan yerlerde veya gizli olan haritada belli olmayan bazı mağralarda **** mağralarda veya soru işaretlerinde bazı diyagramlar bulunmakta bu diyagramları yapabilmek için seviyesi yeterli silah dükkanlarında veya zırh dükkanlarında yapabilirsiniz.Silah satan yerlerde silah craft yapabiliyorsunuz,zırh satanlarda zırh craft edebiliyorsunuz ama unutmayın bu satış yapan yerlerin seviyeleri yeterli olmalıdır.Şimdi gelelim kendimizin yaptığı craftlara karakterimizle yapabileceğimiz craftlar sınırlı bunlar şifa iksirleri,saldırı ve savunma gücünüzü artıran iksirler ve silahlara uygulanan yağlar.Şimdi gelelim silahlara basılan taşlara bu taşlar silahınıza bazı özellikler vermektedir.Bunlar buz,ateş,kanama,hasar,zırh delme gibi özelliklere sahip taşlardır.Sıra bosslarda oyunda bulunan boss oldukça güzel hazırlanmışlar ama biraz kolay olmuş çünkü karakteriniz belli seviye gelince çok rahat bir şekilde bossları yenebiliyorsunuz.Oyunda görev çeşidi oldukça fazla peki bu görevler nelerdir?

If you're tired of the video game establishment either lecturing you on the one hand or on the other extreme treating you like a gullible mindless idiot then swim towards this shining island that stands amidst a sea of generic, cliched mediocrity. This game does the simple things well, extremely well, story, adventure, plot, characters, you know the stuff that falls by the wayside in other games. At no point does it talk down to you, baffle you, or insult your intelligence. It treats the gamer with respect, no corners are cut and the overall quality is high across the board. TW3 does not disappoint, there's no meh, that wasn't worth it moment. The game is great value, worth every penny, you certainly won't feel short changed by it. I'm already looking forward to their next game Cyberpunk 2077. Shame the score can't go to 100.",10,2017-04-04,PC,user
SABlister,"A sprawling epic role playing game following the exploits and adventures of the guy trying to catch up to the hero. The games protagonist, Geralt is on a search for his daughter for most of this game, while she goes through a harrowing adventure dodging a vicious and unstoppable army. You hear, see through some short flashbacks, and are told through expository dialogue what's been happening, but it's the mundane stories and problems in the world of the Witcher that Geralt runs into that provide a very human and compelling adventure. It sounds strange and possible boring to be playing a minor player in a grander adventure, but as Geralt you get to see and shape the small stories that fall to the wayside in these grand adventures. Unlike most protagonists in role playing games, Geralt has a personality, history, and friend, leading to great dialogue and interactions with characters. You can shape his decisions and to a small extent his personality, but Geralt is his own man who will respond with personality all his own. This is in thanks to some of the best writing and cinematography in a videogame to date, giving all the characters, big, small, or even as tiny as a no name shopkeeper, personality or a story for no other reason than to flesh out the people and world. A review of the Witcher 3 wouldn't be complete without praising the absolute technical mastery that has gone into this games graphics and animations, without a doubt they give the grand vistas, horror, the emotional, and even comical moments so much more punch. From small things, like a grimace from a bad joke, wrinkle of the forehead, to the large things like a character crying over a friends death or the look in a mans face as falls into a suicidal despair. They don't make the story or the game, but in conjunction with the writing it provides a boost that pushes the Witcher 3 to a level above any RPG that has come before it. For Fans of the Witcher series, it's a must buy and for people completely unfamiliar with the series it is as well. One warning I give to players, even though it is spectacular from the beginning, the game is so large it can feel so daunting with the massive amount of content available that many players will not be able to get hooked by it with only an hour or two. But I guarantee, if you stick with it for another couple hours, do a few more quests, the game will sink it's claws into you.",10,2017-04-03,PC,user

lmon,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is easily my favorite game that I have ever played. I generally love any open world fantasy RPG, but Wild Hunt is a true masterpiece of the genre. The world is one of the most impressive I have seen, it is large, interesting, and extremely deep and engaging. I love the character and enemy design, the crones made me cringe every time I saw them and other enemies are chilling to fight. The game is very well optimized, I had no trouble with it, this is impressive because the game looks absolutely beautiful and I couldn't help but take multiple screenshots. The game play is also very polished and fun, fighting is seamless and tactical, though it could be a little more in-depth, I was disappointment that the crossbow was next to useless but in the end the sword-play is the real meat of the combat. As for the story it is extremely engrossing, interesting, and made me actually care about characters and what happened in the game. I was actually extremely disappointment that I missed a quest and the world didn't turn out the way I'd hoped. There are many choices to be made and relationships to develop, the RPG element is not overlooked and I appreciated it greatly. Even the side quests are developed in detail and are almost as interesting as the main story. With all the different quests, contracts, and treasure hunts there is a near endless amount of time to be spent with the game. There is even a card game, gwent, that could be it's own standalone game, which is fun and interesting, just like the rest of the game. Overall The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a true masterpiece and I completely recommend it to any RPG lover, action fan, or general gamer looking for fun combat, and engrossing world, or gripping story. 11/10",10,2017-03-31,PC,user

Along your adventure you come across a wide variety of monsters with every monster having their own weaknesses and backstories that you get to discover along your adventures.

So early in 2017 i finally bought this game. I veplayed Witcher 1 and Witcher 2 before so i know a bit about Geralt. When this game started i began to realize that this game has evolved into a magnifcent game. A game that i really dream of since my 30 years in gaming. Everything is special and perfect. Yeah its almost a gift from Heaven! Im scared of running out of words of how i explain this. - Great Open World with many surprises inside it, Not an empty open world like we encounter in MetalGearSolidVPP, Shadow Mordor, HZD, Dragon Age Inq etc ...This open world is true memorable and worth exploring! -Great , deep, and memorable storylines and plot in almost every Mission/Side Q along with great Cutscene and Camera angles too! - Fluid movement and smooth combat, Its not as great as Shadow of Mordor combat style, or Darksoulds III but well its better than previous version, -Great sounds, Great Voice acted and Great music. -Great graphics . animations, great facial expressions. -Great character design makes all character in game are attractive and memorable. - Bla bla i just cant say no more, you have to experience it yourself. Im gonna tell you this : this is NOT a game, this is EXPERIENCE. This is the example of how the AAA game should be delivered to customer. Everything seems Magic.

PEnchan707,"This is what gaming is all about. A developer taking tried and tested gameplay and mechanics and lifting it all to a highly ambitious new level. Everything here, except combat, is a new benchmark for story-driven, fantasy open world game. Yet, even though the combat doesn't break new boundaries, it's is still very enjoyable and varied (thanks to the distinct skill trees); definitely the best swordplay, bomb throwing and igni casting in the series. A huge world with everything from swamps, forests, caves systems, grassy plains, mountains and snow drifts are all beautifully detailed and handcrafted to feel inviting and vivid. Villages of all types, large, small, poor and wealthy all feel like realistic places, not a bit of copy and paste in sight. The several large cities and castles show great imagination and **** the player into a world of unparalleled richness. This detail and variety extends to virtually all the side quests and npc's too, and by God, are there a lot of them, all voiced and with personalities of their own. The game doesn't patronise you or tell you what to think and few npc's are simply black and white in their characterisations. The Bloody Baron questline is probably the most adult themed, mature story-line of an rpg I've ever played and it's exceptional because it was handled with such even handedness, care and considered gravity. No histrionics or lecturing from a pulpit here. There's a great amount of treasure to loot, Witcher Gear to craft, monster lairs to clear and just sheer exploration to be had, never knowing what's around the corner. Enemies variety is good, with the variety being enhanced by how different the approaches needed to tackle them are. Dealing with armed men is different from armed men with shields which in turn is far different form animals and humanoid monsters, who are also different to the larger beasts and, of course, the several bosses on offer. The game give me many different emotions as I moved through the main campaign and the side quests. Moments of sadness, situations that surprised me, times of doubt and indecision due to the morally grey choices I had to make and even times with unexpected humour, sentimentality or warmth. It meant that things never felt stale and I was always eager for more. I could go on an on but, especially with the sumptuous expansions which I urge you to pick up, this is simply one of my all time favourtie games and definitely my favourite open-world, fantasy, story driven RPG. I clocked up 135 hours on this game but was so reluctant to leave its world I played another 11 hours just to clear up little quests and collect the extra Witcher sets. I wasn't gonna even use them since they didn't fit my build but I was just looking for any excuse to continue the experience. I have also since played through again, along with the expansion so have 300+ hours now and plan to play through New Game+ sometime in the future at 4k resolution for an even more immersive experience. I can't say better than that really :)",10,2017-03-21,PC,user
Thirustime,"A great game, but a poor opw. The worlds only purpose is to be beautiful and atmospheric. Narrative and quests are disconnected from the world and tho there are decisions to be made within the narrative none of them is displayed in the world. The quest desgine is linear and doesnt takes advantage of an opw ( to be fair the fewest opw games do). There is no exploration. Everything is marked on the map and besides of the marks there is nothing to find in the world. The visuals are amazing, voiceacting on point, production even in sidequest from times to times breathtaking, satisfying combat tho its too easy (lack of stamina), The character develoment is minimal and boring, tho the pick perk tree with 12 slots could be a start for a good one. The perks itself are boring element and other systems build around it are missing completely. The mainstory is visualized very well, characters are great and it gives a good pace to ""explore"" the world. Tho its good it isnt outstanding as it is praised so often. It doesnt expands the story of the books and even adds less to it. Key elements are missing (in regards of the elderblood and the wild hunt, as well as the iceage). The antagonist is the worst of the entire franchise. Hes underrepresented. This sounds a lot more negative than 9 doesnt it? For me its barley a 9 (i would give it anything between 88 - 90). The quest quality is amazing. There are so many quest which are staged so well, with interessting small or bigger stories. Everything has a narrative. The world is maybe just the set of the game but damn it is looks great. Dialogues look like cutsence. The game has a lot to offer but it fails at being openworld and using this feature. Is it better than Skyrim? Dont even compare. Witcher 3 is a story based rpg which uses its opw as a beautiful set, skyrim is build around an opw.

Hoag,"The Witcher 3, while a vibrant and beautiful open world, unfortunately fails at what makes a game, well... a game. It is simply not fun. The combat is a mindless early Assassin's Creed rip-off. The huge, vibrant world is ultimately empty and boring. Nearly all the missions amount to you activating your special powers to follow glowing red tracks. The difficulty slider only serves to make enemies damage sponges. The story is decent enough, but TW3 fails on the most important point: It's not fun to play, it's basically an interactive movie, not a game. 2/10.",2,2017-03-11,PC,user
inkblowout,"Game is meh at best for me. I don't see how it's the best RPG of all time. Story is probably the only thing The Witcher 3 excels on, although I'm not a huge fan of the story (I stopped playing after 10 hours.) it seems to be reasonably paced similar with Baldur's Gate 1 and 2. Side missions are pretty cool too. Nice to do different things except for once and each side mission has different outcomes which is neat. But why a 7/10. Because the gameplay is dreadful. This is where The Witcher 3 really loses it's points because the combat system is just bland. Like sure the first couple of encounters I loved killing enemies left and right but then it gets old quick. People have told me to increase the difficulty.... but that doesn't change anything. You are limited to a formula styled combat system which is the BIGGEST reason that makes it bland. It isn't tactic as people say it is... it just feels like I'm playing a easier version of Dark Souls, but dark souls you need to adapt, with The Witcher 3, all you really have to do is put some oils, use the proper sword and witcher **** some the combat could be interesting but to me it got old really quick. And you are limited to Geralt, a witcher... you know what that means, you cannot play a character you want to play. They gave you a template and said ""Here now you shape your character with what you get."" In RPGs you actually get to choose different classes and races and with all these choices available for you to role play off from. You hardly get much to progress in this game, and the game is a role playing game... you get to role play yes but you are really limited compared when playing other roleplaying games. Overall Gameplay > Story People don't seem to understand nowadays that good stories doesn't make a game good. It's a good gameplay that will prosper overall. If I wanted a good story, I would rather read a book. So I don't see how Witcher 3 can be the best RPG even when classics like Ultima, Planescape Tourment, Baldur's Gate, Early TES exist. Witcher 3 is a good story driven game, easily comparable to current Bioware titles such as Mass Effect and Dragon Age. Also to all you hardcore fanboys out there... stop comparing The Witcher 3 with ever damn game that releases. I swear one dude compared The Witcher 3 to Forza Horizon 3. I'm not joking.",7,2017-03-11,PC,user

Stevenseagal75,"Do not get deceived by the Fallout 4 fanboys talking trash about this masterpiece in their outdated 1 review account. This game is not perfect but it sure is close to it since the dozen patches fixing almost everything like in inventory system ect.. Also keep in mind you can mod it changing the gameplay making it harder or similar to Dark souls or making the game's graphics look even better. with that said the vanilla gameplay is simple when you're used to it and will most likely not care since all you'll care about is the story and the stories told in this game are inspired from so many cultures all over the globe and from different religions to create a refreshing experience that even the side of a side quest look like a mainquest and the side quests are better than the mainquests IMO were choices still matters and make you think since its not some black and white generic choices but gray that still make you wonder which of the choices are better with the lesser evil ect.. And then the two DLC's are two other masterpieces that feel like a new game especially the B&W expansion with new musics, And speaking of music you'll listen to over a hundred original soundtracks both in exploration and combat that are so good you'll remember them for the rest of your life just like you'll remember the breathtaking cities and lands that feel alive with their own stories to tell and change the mood of the game. So after doing 5 playthroughs both in vanilla and modded with 3 of this playthroughs on a pirated version i immediately bought the game when i could to play it even more with 408 more hours on steam with probably a total of 1000 hours. So i can say this is most certainly the best game ever created and i can't wait for cyberpunk2077. Go buy this game now.",10,2017-03-08,PC,user

This game is a master piece. The story is awesome, it makes you attached to it characters and the plot is amazing, this is the best story driven RPG I played. The combat is so good.

MrDracky,"O jogo vem como final de uma trilogia de jogos (The Witcher 1 e 2), e diversas partes na história falam de um assunto dos jogos anteriores, então recomendo primeiro jogar pelo menos o 2 ou ver um resumo sobre eles para não se perder na história assim como me perdi na primeira vez que fui jogar hehe. Mas enfim, vamos direto ao ponto: Para mim esse jogo foi simplesmente o melhor jogo RPG que já joguei na minha vida, um pouco à frente de Skyrim, pois ele reúne todas as características base parar um ótimo RPG, e traz algo que acho que muitos deviam trazer; coisas para não ser enjoativo, principalmente por ser singleplayer, essas coisas seriam, história e personagens cativantes, minigames que poderiam sozinhos já serem um jogo(principalmente Gwent, garanto que será difícil encontra um minigame melhor em outros jogos), além de você poder guiar a história do seu jeito com as suas escolhas, o que dá a sensação de você ser mesmo o Geralt (personagem principal). E sobre os Cons do jogo e seus problemas? Eu realmente acho que além dos bugs, não são tantos mas muitos incomodam um pouco, como você estar correndo igual um idiota com seu cavalo Carpeado até que bate em uma árvore e cai para um lugar bugado e vazio, mas todo o terreno onde você estava continua lá em cima, aí você precisa retornar no último save, mas não há nenhum bug que chegue a bugar seu jogo pra sempre, é só voltar no save. O resto serão de probleminhas que muitas vezes vão do jogador, por exemplo, eu gostaria de poder bater em todo mundo roubar tudo e poder botar fogo nas vilas (não sou nada maudoso xiu aí), mas não é possível, acredito que é porque isso poderia contradizer partes da história, mas enfim de problema mesmo são só esses bugzinhos Depois de muita enrolação e blá blá blá da minha convivência com o jogo, vou finalizar minha avaliação: Ótimo, vale muito apena comprar e jogar, garanto que você irá se divertir muito! E passar muito nervoso se colocar no Marcha da Morte (Modo Ultra Hard), se você é amante de RPGs ou já jogou os anteriores é OBRIGATÓRIO comprar isso! Se você ainda não conhece o mundo dos RPGs singleplayer, vale a pena comprar mesmo assim, mas acho bom pesquisar gameplays antes.",10,2017-01-20,PC,user

kingplain,"This game is alright. It feels like a hybrid between assassins creed and skyrim: Triple A open world RPG. If I wasn't aware of its ""best game of 2015"" status I wouldn't have guessed it on my own. It's fun. It'll hold your attention. But it's not a 10/10 game. I like that there's constantly options on how to resolve quests, similar to Fallout New Vegas. That's the best part about the game and the place where it excels beyond its peers. Beyond that, there's room for improvement. Namely in the inventory and combat. The inventory is needlessly complicated. I'm not a big fan of crafting/alchemy, or the silly card card in a game. That stuff doesn't appeal to me. It feels like an added bonus feature that doesn't add anything but makes everything actually want to do filled with spam items and NPCs. Would be nice if there was an option to turn it off. Combat's not that great. Fight one person/thing is easy enough, but groups of enemies will gang up and cut you down quickly. There's no good way to handle it without resorting to cheap tactics yourself. The lock-on feature is useless as well. The controls are very squishy and imprecise. I've devolved into swearing at my character as he inexplicably turns to fight an enemy when he's supposed to be running away, or when he gets stuck on a fence. A big issue I have is how dark this game is. With my computer, monitor, and in game settings maxed out, I can see anything indoors. Google shows I'm not the only one with the issue. I often find myself navigating indoor areas by the mini-map and witcher sense because everything on screen is just black.

Many games today feel like nothing but cash grabs with poor writing and uninteresting characters. But that cannot be said for The Witcher 3. We got plenty of free DLC's and 2 proper expansions. The story is interesting, it makes you want to keep playing, there are plenty of interesting side quests that don't feel generic. The game has interesting characters and hard choices to be made. It took me over 60 hours before I even went to Novigrad the first time because there was so much to explore. After feeling disappointed with so many games lately, The Witcher 3 really stepped up and gave me the gaming experience that I've been looking for. No game is without flaws and there are certainly some minor once to be found even in this but overall I would say that this has become one of the best games I've ever played.

valerian,"A well-made game, but not the greatest modern RPG. by far. Which is sad, because I know how much sacrifice was put into this. PROS + Sidequests and monster contracts are fun, even if they bring the story way out of focus. + Novigrad, though you don’t get to change the politics of asides killing a few badguys + Combat controls are improved, not clunky. + High quality models and graphics. Beautiful game for screencapping. +Despite its story, the WRITING is good. Lambert, Kiera, Dijkstra and Regis are fab. +I hate Ciri, but the relationship between her and Geralt is authentic, for what it is. +++ GWENT. CONS -Open world KILLED the narrative. Why find the girl, save the world from very ‘fast’ villains when I can spend 50+ hours on sidequests with no consequence whatsoever. I can even start Blood and Wine and travel to Toussaint right before I begin the final quest/boss battle. Immersion wise, this is abysmal. - Wild Hunt are punch-clock villains. We’re told they’re the worst, but what they DO is dismal. This goes hand in hand with an open world. The Wild Hunt never does anything because they are waiting for YOU. -Environments except Novigrad are cut+paste. Felt nothing for White Orchard, or the other clones in Velen. -Skellige’s political ‘plot’ is Bioware grade. Skellige itself also felt shoehorned in. Should’ve been cut from the main game and developed further into a 3rd expansion pack, imho. - The lack of mentioning of some certain characters *cough* IORVETH* *cough* is irritating. After many patches and two EPs, there is not even a single journal entry. - Combat healing= nuked difficulty. - It’s easy make money buy what you want, compared to W2. Roleplaying wise, if you are supposed to be a poor witcher, this is a flaw. - Ciri. Didn’t like her from the books, don’t like her now. She’s in real need of some actual character flaws. Overall, a good game, but with it’s flaws, as a game that strives for better STORY, this fell way off the mark. And that’s disappointing, considering how much crunch time went into this. Perhaps if the devs got more sleep they would've thought to get their fundamentals down than being more 'ambitious'. TL;DR: Dragon Age: Inquisition, but better.

Proxyzygy,"The Witcher 3 is a beautiful game let down by a painful combat system and lazy quest design. THE PROS: -The Witcher 3 is a work of art -Graphics. It needs to be said that not only is this game is GORGEOUS, but it easily runs at +60fps. -Beautiful soundtrack, definitely one of the best game OSTs of recent years. From heart pounding combat music to haunting exploration music. -Well written story. Your hunt for Ciri is believable and well written thrusting Geralt into a series of smaller and ultimately interconnecting storylines. -Believable (and more importantly memorable) characters. The characters you interact with have their own personality and motivations, some you'll love and some you'll hate. THE CONS: -Keyboard controls are awful. Feels like controlling a JCB riding a tank. Use a controller. -Menus are clunky as hell. Heaps of wasted screen real estate here with a 3D model of Geralt and his currently equipped items taking up over half of the screen whilst your inventory items. Your actual inventory items however (I'm looking at you potions and decoctions menu) are relegated to a tiny area forcing you to either memorize the icons or rely on the tooltip (which more often than not fails to show.) Enemy Upscaling. This optional feature works great for the run of the mill cannon fodder enemies but some of the enemies just scale like crap, I'm looking to you Djinn! -Combat. Really, really repetitive. Every single fight feels exactly the same as the previous, occasionally you might get the excitement of using a different Sign or Oil. The last boss is the prime example of this, he fights just like one of the hundreds of bandits you've killed. -Exploration. Yes the world is big. Yes the world is beautiful, but exploring it feels unrewarding when it's as empty as this, there ARE “hidden” things but if you get within half a mile of them the game effectively shouts “There's a hidden thing here!!” and marks it on your map. -Pacing, at least if you're doing any side missions. By the time I'd cleared Velen and Novigrad this game just dragged for me. -Novigrad. It's pretty and it LOOKS like a city however it's all a facade. You could count the accessible building in Novigrad without taking your socks off, in the crowds of random citizens you'll inevitably find several sets of quadruplets, the random citizens also have all the life and brains of **** (they might run away if there's a fight near them... Maybe). -Skellige. I nearly hung up my controller and uninstalled here. I'd thought Skillige would be a rough and hard land surrounded by rough seas.. Nope, flat and clear Mediterranean waters that you have to traverse on a slow as **** boat. -Side Quests. Even though I didn't wind up doing too many of them after Novigrad. You can dress them up with voice acting or put in a ""follow the red stuff"" Witcher sense bit but in the end fetch/kill quests are still fetch/kill quests and are nothing more than padding. -GPS. Why? Why do we have a GPS!? -Triss Merigold. Actually any of the games redheads. Apparently the “Bozo the Clown” gene is rampant in The Witcher 3.",5,2016-11-20,PC,user

RMDsilva,"The Bad: 1) combat, even at higher difficulties, is still rather brainless and sometimes not enjoyable. While it's better than a lot of Action RPGs, it can't compete with old-school boss strategies of old games or complicated character development to focus on one strategy or the other. For the life of me that I can't realise what's the point of bombs and the crossbow, for example. Or if there's anything that beats heavy multipliers on sword damage. 2) Side quests are not bad - but most of them are still fillers. Multiple monster contracts on similar challenges and underdeveloped stories, why the hell would I check all the ? points?, horse riding is boring, etc. Open world games have this problem: everything needs to be fun and it's hard to be a GTA :D 3) You're just itching to have a bigger influence in the story - and see those changes reflected.. and that's hard! There are few situations where I felt that having a brain and asking the right questions made a difference: maybe they could take a leaf from LA noire?

Then, about a year ago, I bought it through steam, thinking what the hell, I want an RPG/Adventure and I tried it. I was caught up in the game immediately. Even the cutscenes are a pleasure to watch. This game does so many things right - even to the perfection I claim. For example every character has a backstory. Without giving away spoilers, imagine you find a potential treasure, a dead body and a letter nearby. Read it and you will learn the poor bastard was tricked or possibly robbed underway, often a sad story but it gives you clue where to find the real treasure - which was a gift to his new bride to be waiting for him to show up. So now you have a background story and a clue to a treasure. It's so well doe, each and every time again. Of course the game has a few negatives, but they are so insignificant I almost didn't write them down, but here they go: first of all lot of gear you pick up is useless. Think of swords and armor. It's just to sell them for money. Actually I should say it it a reverse way; too little gear is useful. You only have to settle with a relative few sets of gears and the rest is scrap. The second and final complaint is the availability of rare herbs and materials is too low. And when you need them you have no clue where to look for in this huge (!) land, so you are forced to resort to answers on a forum by fellow players. I consider it a bit of cheating but you won't have a choice. That's all the negativity I have to share. If you love or like RPG/Adventure games then this is it. Not to mention the phenomenal sounds and music, graphics are to drool over, aaah I'm getting crazy lol! And finally there's tons of content, meaning you won't be finished for a long long time. If that's not all, there are endless mods available, I used about 13 of them. I wanted to write more good stuff but forgot what it was. So you know what, buy it will ya? Oh, now I remember: the follow-up add-on games, Blood and Wine and Heart of Stone are awesome to. Honestly, buy them immediately. Especially Heart of Stone is well integrated as you can use Heart of Stone as a major (!) side quest. Blood and Wine is for the more experienced player who finished the original quests first. So,if you have a beating hart, you must buy, unless you have a Heart of Stone. In that case go to hell... :) (Did you see what I did there? Did you? Did you? Haha I'm having so much fun with this game even when I'm not playing.)",10,2016-10-23,PC,user
Nebukarr,"To make it short: I've played so many RPGs since the time of Elder Scrolls and Ultima. But The Witcher 3 is the ""game to end all games"". I wouldn't say it's perfect. But it's as close as a gamestudio would ever get!!! The story is fantastic. Even side-characters are well portrayed. The quests and events in the world fascinate from the very first minute. There is not a SINGLE quest which is repetitive. And then there is more: My personal favorite is the expansion ""Heart of Stone"", which tells you a story inspired by Goethes Faust. Holy crap! I've never seen a plot build up like this in a video game. And all of this in an astonishing witcher universe. This game is obligatory for everyone who has even the slightest interest in video games!!",10,2016-10-22,PC,user
marc5477,"For the sake of objectivity I will compare this game to Witcher 2 and Skyrim. Witcher 3 is designed to be more open than previous games and the worlds areas are certainly larger. They are no where near as large as Elder Scroll games like Skyrim. I did enjoy wandering around a bit but for the most part it did not feel like I accomplished anything with my exploration. I did save a few small settlements and found places of power but for the most part there was very little out there. Loot was not rewarding (except for shrines which awarded a skill point) and enemies were much too repetitive. Still, it was well done and I would give W3 a +1 for making the effort to make the game more open. In terms of combat, for the most part, W3 is a nice upgrade from Witcher 2 where Geralt was a **** ballerina. He is still semi **** in this game, but it was not as bad. Case and point, I was on the roof of a building and I just wanted to turn a little to open a chest. I tap the back key for a millisecond and Geralt decides to nose dive off the roof to his death... **** and clearly designed for consoles! The design in W2 and W3 is to make movements slightly 'heavy' to throw the timing of the player off a little (again a console trick that does not translate well to PC). This is a very cheap way to add difficulty and it is only temporary. I dont like it because it gets old and breaks immersion. But like I said it is still better than W2 because they removed a few of the ridiculous quick hit spins from W2 that hindered combat but he still does a lot of unnecessary twirling that does not benefit him in any way. The problem still persists sometimes in that the enemy is standing right there in front of me, and all he needs to do is quickly stab forward but there is no way to instruct Geralt to do a quick stab. The stab he makes in random so sometimes he decides to do a torpedo spin before swinging giving time to the enemy to move out of the way or even face forward. It is dumb. Yes you can avoid this problem in a few ways (again I always play at highest difficulty so finishing the game and difficulty is a non-issue) but it breaks immersion because while it is happening it feels like I am fighting the poor game design more than fighting an enemy in the game. Further, as an RPG, you are trying to progress your character but in this game you actively try to regress because using Geralt's footwork talents makes things worse. Makes me wonder why he bothered to train all those years (hence again, immersion breaking). On top of all this, the problem with targeting remains from W2 though due to the world being larger and more open, it was easier to deal with in W3. A nice plus to the game is that enemies tend to be fairly different and exploiting weaknesses really does matter especially when you face enemies significantly higher level than yourself. Of course, you could always avoid them until you level up more making the fight more trivial but it is fun to have the option to take them on when you are weak. It really feels like you accomplished something when beat them when you are not supposed to. The game excels the same way the old Witcher games do. Story telling is still strong with good voice acting, and a believable story that is easy to immerse yourself into. There were a few places where I would have wanted more flexibility in the options presented but that is a minor issue and it is understandable given that we are trying to follow a somewhat linear story in the grand scheme of things.",8,2016-10-22,PC,user

AndyTiran,"Lets start from saying that I bought it on sale and it still doesn't worth it.. I`m really disappointed with this game. The truth is, Witcher 3 is a bad overrated PC game. It's so bad, mostly because of its CLUMSY, Repetitive and Dull combat mechanics. I lost interest on the first forest fight and stopped there. Main character feels like a heavy truck, not as a dexterous cat he meant to be. Well yes, maybe the story would have been good, but I`m not going through the game with its bad controls and combat system, because when doing so, you literally feel physical pain and frustration.. so, so bad..

ShodanSpectre,"I'm updating the review now that I've beat the game for the 2-nd time, this time with a few mods. The goods were said in all the 10/10 reviews, a few personals are: + The world maps are truly huge, AND filled. Exploration is rewarding. + The music is epic! + Many say Roach's controls are clunky. But one can see it as a game mechanic - it's a horse, not a car. Ever tried controlling a horse? Also - she can teleport to within 30m of you from ANYWHERE on the world map. That's a (immersion-breaking?) ability that lets me easily forgive her getting stuck in front of a knee-high fence here and there. - Even more than Roach, people say Geralt's combat controls are clunky. Have to admit there's truth in that. But - there are mods for it. In fact: despite absence of a proper modding SDK (unlike T.E.S. games) - there are MANY fan-created mods. Many of them modify the combat system in various ways. I got one that disabled the soft-lock on a target during combat - although that lock still remains for a split second after attacking. - The level system of the vanilla game (""this lvl 30 drowner will one-hit you, and this lvl 8 Royal Wyvern you can beat to death with your fists""). And guards that always stay 13 lvls above Geralt. Some people are perfectly fine with this, I found a levelling mod: so that no creature or NPC is unbeatable, nor do they become harmless. - Same applies to gear. - Gear level restrictions. In a Witcher game. Geralt can't use thiz sword 'cuz his lvl izz too loo! Really? :-/ - Unlike W-1, the gear you start with is typical throwaway starter gear, and any bandit in Velen will have weapons superior to a Kaer Morhen Witcher sword. - There are many weapons and armor sets that differ ONLY in the lvl number slapped on them. I guess the for grind-lovers... I finished the game with a couple lvl-12 swords and similar gear that I liked visually. Kind of rebelled against this stupid gear-grind system. - Again unlike W-1, the potions only last 20sec base, up to maybe a minute if you max out alchemy skills. Inventory management (and pause) is available during combat. ""Potion duration"" mod fixes this. - Potion, bomb and oils creation: you have to only brew/craft them once, autoreplenished afterwards. ""Preparations"" mod fixes this. - Bombs and bolts are SEVERELY underpowered. Totally worthless if you mod the game so that you have to gather all ingredients to craft EACH ONE. The vanilla game expected you to easily waste 9-12 bombs per fight and trivially replenish them. The ""basic"" bolts are infinite, but I'd prefer costly but effective bombs, and limited bolts that actually do damage. - Can't jump/leap during combat. Causes artificial problems in a few cases. - Fall damage in vanilla is devastating. C'mon Geralt, you can survive jumping off a 5-meter balcony dammit! ""Fall damage"" mods... +- Fistfights... Use a different mechanic than normal combat, takes used to. They are rare enough to not bother. Which makes them rather difficult... Same idea as with Roach - gotta get used to it, or not complain if you didn't bother to. - Walking downstairs is apparently very hard for Geralt - he keeps tripping and rolling down :-D - The Bloody Baron and Rescue Dandelion quests had a few very stupid twists ""Just use a maxed-out Axii and make the guy spit it out!"" and ""Just sneak into the Temple Isle dungeon like you did in so many others!"". But no. Had to search for lost goats and write a play instead, respectively. - Questing/dialogues in general: as with most RPGs, the reply choices are sometimes painfully limited. - Merchants sell 5-10 times more expensive than they buy. But - PLENTY of loot everywhere. I still had over like 8000 orens at the end, and hundreds of florens and the other currency I never even bothered to exchange at Vivaldi's, . The game doesn't have a good resource management system. And I had thousands worth of loot I never bothered to use for anything, because... - Virtually no reason to craft OR buy any gear or runestones/glyphs - there's a Mastercrafted Sword to loot in just about every dungeon and every other shack. Same for armor, runestones and glyphs. After ~lvl15 I stopped bothering to pick those up. After ~lvl 20 almost stopped looting around whatsoever. This was all on Blood&Broken Bones btw. But there are mods for loot too: ""Hunter mod"", etc. - Even after romancing Triss and rejecting Yen, some later cutscenes imply that Geralt's fiancee is Yen. Yen acts along as if nothing happened. + But in general, W-3 is better than most RPGs at lasting consequences of your choices. Overall 10/10 for graphics, music, level design, and quality (aka no bugs, crashes or obvious glitches). Vanilla game gets only 5/10 in gameplay, combat, the uselessness of resource management and crafting. But you can pull those up with mods of your personal preference. Gets a strong 8/10 for storyline, quests and dialogues... more like 10/10 with a few 3/10 oddballs. Ok, I'm off to the expansions!",8,2016-09-23,PC,user

LosOutlier,"An epic journey around a beautiful, vast open world. Three games into the series (all of which I've played) and this was, on balance, better than it's predecessors (though W1 still the most charming). Things I loved: - a long storyline which invests you in the characters emotionally - beautiful world, beautiful music (I'd move to Velen if I could - with a summer house in Skellige) - simple yet mostly satisfying combat style (I never used enemy-lock though) - much improved inventory/crafting interface - and a very strong character building system which finally forces you to chose a single way (with the option to revamp using potion of clearance when you so choose - great for tweaking) - you can 'lose' the game (like I did - very sad about it I was too) based on your decisions with a variety of endings. - You can abandon the main storyline whenever you feel like and go exploring in a HUGE world - Gwent > Dice - Roach Dropped the ball: - Far too easy to accumulate money because there is too much stuff to loot and sell - Alchemy has also become far too easy as you just need to find the herbs once and then it replenishes every time you meditate - part of the fun of W1 and W2 was having to take time out from the story to go foraging for the herbs needed to make the potions you needed - it's too easy in W3 - Enemies on harder levels don't get smarter, they just have higher stats meaning that they are still easy to beat once you know how they fight. Come the second half of the game end it's just too easy (played hardest setting with enemy upscaling enabled) to win fights. - Can't fight the guards (w/o getting KO'd in one hit anyway) All in all, whether new to the series or not, W3 is pretty awesome.",8,2016-09-11,PC,user

Great PC port, great graphics, great music, best voice acting in business. The story is probably the best in gaming. Tons of meaningful quests and sidequests.

YoloSwag4Doge,"This game is an excellent example of what consists of a well made RPG. In contrast to ubisoft rpg's, such as assassin's creed and the division, The Witcher 3 isn't simply a large fantasy world filled with generic, copy & pasted quests/missions, nor mindless combat mechanics. The vast majority of quests involve (highly) creative plots, in-depth characters and meaningful choices. The combat is engaging and offers a diverse array of defensive/offensive tools to use. Bombs, crossbows, swords, maces, axes, potions, sword oils and signs. The signs are basically like jedi powers, (similar to mass effect abilities as well), that you can use to help you in fights. There's a parry mechanic when fighting other swordsman, but the dodge and roll mechanic is what really gives you the freedom to position yourself better. And unlike AC, enemies don't attack you one by one. They come at you all at once and while it can be frustrating at first, it becomes a rewarding challenge. There's of course a complex skill tree as well. My only main beef is the way the main character and his horse interact with objects and terrain. For lack of a better word, it can become extremely derpy and frustrating, especially when trying to get out of a puddle, because for some reason Geralt forgets how walking works. The horse can get stuck on tiny rocks, or jammed on a small 0.5ft cliff as if there's an invincible, impenetrable wall in front of it. These bugs aren't game breaking by any means and you learn to avoid them, but they can be bothersome nonetheless.",9,2016-09-03,PC,user
Zix32,"Masterpiece. The World is filled with hundreds of quests and none of them feel boring or with a weak plot. Every quest is thought out perfectly. Every character feels different, not to mention the places. White Orchard feels distinctively different from Novigrad and The Skellige Iseles. All of these places feel like they have history, depth and filled with character. For Example On the Skellige Iseles the houses seem very barbaric, but the Castles are very different. Novigrad feels very much alive. You can see people buying from the markets, poor people on the streets and shady people walking around with their cloak's on. The Monsters have diversity. There are Necrophages, Ogroids, Vampires, Specters, Hybrids, Insectoids, Draconids... They all have different styles and different weaknesses. The combat feels fluid and responsive. When you hit and enemy it feels like you really did damage, not to mention the Signs. You start out with their default aspects. But later on as you progress you can change the way they react and make them differently. This isn't diverse as in the Elder Scrolls but it still is quite amusing. The writing and music are amazing. The Story has a very good plot and the music makes you thrilled when you go to battle and makes you enjoy and feel the beautiful lands of the world. Crafting and potion making aren't great but aren't bad, you will have trouble getting the ingredients at the beginning, but later on isn't a big deal.

Renstik,"On release day, my friend bought the game and recommended that I do the same. Neither of us had ever played a Witcher game, but we heard that the last couple were good, so we gave this one a shot. I thought this game would be good, but instead it exceeded every expecation I had in spectacular fashion. Gameplay - fun, challenging combat, fantastic quests (the side quests are just as interesting and fun as the main quests), and your choices matter, thanks to the game's ridiculous amount of endings. Story - every good adjective I can think of. Andrzej Sapkowski's vision of a lore-filled and vast fantasy world filled with so many interesting characters is masterfully given form. Music - solid all-around soundtrack that adds life to the entire experience. Graphics and Performance - a beautiful game even on low-medium settings, and it runs like a beauty as long as you don't get overzealous and crank everything higher than your build can handle. I recommend turning the fancy hair graphics off completely, and then it shouldn't take much tweaking to get good performance. Marketing - thought I'd include this because CD Projekt Red is the super hero of game developers. They charge $60 for a game that has a ~60 hours camaign and loads of other hours in the form of side quests and activities, not to mention the quality of all those hours of content. Then, they make a kickass DLC with about 12 hours of content and charge $10 for it. The next DLC costs $20, and it delivered upwards of 30 hours of the same quality content (plus a feakin' entirely new zone) I had already experienced from the base game and the first DLC (for some reason they called it a DLC and not The Witcher 4: Blood and Wine). Negatives - very few, and overall the good FAR outweighs the bad. Your player does move a bit clunkily (movement is clearly favored towards consoles), and you aren't able to customize your character or do crazy, random actions the way you can do in similar games like Skyrim. Although I do not think this, some say that they feel the combat is clunky, too challenging, or just not fun. There have also been a decent number of bugs in the game, but most have been ironed out through updates by now. **WARNING: This game is NOT for you if you have little time on your hands and/or do not enjoy taking breaks from the action to engage in dialogue and story. Some dialogue scenes are lengthly, and although the dialogue itself is superb, many gamers may be turned off by the idea of dedicating so much time to the story and plot choices.** Unless you dislike every good aspect that I have just described, do yourself a favor and purchase this game. It's worth it.",10,2016-08-24,PC,user

Tilde_Gunderson,"The video game industry has recently felt like it's at a low point. Games are constantly being rushed out of development, requiring day-one patches and review embargoes to save dying developing and publishing teams from going belly-up, or resort to cutting half the content of the game and selling the rest as Downloadable Content. Fan entitlement is at an all-time high, creating unimaginable hype for games that would've otherwise been acceptably good games in the past, deemed bad because it didn't live up to its hype. Reviewer integrity is under threat, so much so that customers are beginning to only trust customer reviews rather than reviewer reviews. Even the customer review system is being abused by people who'd give a game a 10/10 ""to offset the 0's"" and 0/10's ""to offset the 10's"". So among all of this sludge, it's nice to see a game developing team that's transparent about delays and issues and sees that if you take care in your work and don't do it just for the money, you can make something to be proud of and still come home a bit richer (as of mid 2015, it nearly doubled its budget in profit). When people'll discuss whether video games could be considered an art form, this game will be front line and centre as an example. CD Projekt Red found a way to create the perfect storm of RPG elements, combat, and story and character development. Every character, no matter how insignificant, is given a backstory. Every side quest is given full dialogue. Every main quest delves not only into the backstory of our main characters, but even the people you didn't know about prior. The dialogue flows naturally, creating a level of immersion you get from watching an episode of Game of Thrones. In fact, if CD Projekt Red simply made Witcher 3 into a TV show and just used the cutscenes from the game, it'd be one of the most popular shows on now. And when you least expect it, they throw in an awesomely addicting card game that's simple to play, but a fair challenge to get a good deck. What else is there to say? If you haven't gotten it yet, go on GOG and pick it up, most likely on sale. $80 is well worth the price of this game. Hell, if it cost $150, it'd still be worth it.",10,2016-08-23,PC,user
eriktheviking11,"I played the first Witcher for a few hours before deciding, unequivocally, that the combat system was not quite as exciting or strategic as playing Pacman. I acknowledge the substance of the lore behind the series and I admire the philosophy of the CD Projekt Red team, which is why, after hesitating for so long, I decided that I'd give the Witcher 3 a whirl. After five hours, I've abandoned the Witcher 3 and just won't bring myself to trust CD Projekt Red again. The combat, again, essentially requires dodging between groups of enemies or around single large ones and using the same repeated sword swings. The animations are different but the action is the same. While there are options to use some abilities, the fundamentals of the combat remain identical and very inane. There are no tactical elements to combat like you would have in a turn based RPG like Baldur's Gate, or RTS games like Starcraft, or stealth-action games like Deus-Ex or Dishonored, or even FPS/Third person fantasy games like the Elder Scrolls. The combat is repeatedly to run into a fight and dodge around with perfect timing and not get hit, which is the gameplay mechanic of a cheap, pump-and-dump console game... and such a waste of the Witcher's content. The flaws of combat essentially ruined the game for me. While the story is interesting, I can (and just have) read it on Wikipedia in 5 minutes to skip the drama (though I'm sure much time was put into the voice acting and animations). Without the drive to improve the character, who (like all RPGs) expresses himself primarily through combat, the side content has no meaning and the main story-line becomes only that - a story-line. I love that they tried to make something so epic in scale of integrated content and take the RPG to somewhere where it hasn't been before but this is still a game and the action in the Witcher is flawed at the core and has remained so through the series. My experience with the Witcher is so frustrating and annoying precisely because I want so badly to enjoy the game but can't get past its most basic flaw - the gameplay is terrible. The pursuit of a massive library of beautiful content is not an excuse for making a bad game. Also, as a post-script, the merchant system doesn't make any sense. You can sell a sword and not buy a piece of bread that heals 20% of your health... perhaps this is supposed to be how things are but I find myself totally ignoring merchants entirely. Furthermore, the crafting system has an incredibly steep learning curve, without any hint as to what makes sense to do or not, which is exacerbated by the nonsensical merchant system. And as a post-post-script, I really hate that I will not be able to convince myself to spend money on Cyberpunk 2077.",2,2016-08-21,PC,user

What stands out most is the level of detail (both in graphics and content), facial expression of characters and the music.

Lone_Wolf_Sones,"The Witcher 3 is not a perfect game but it comes damned close. It rises above its smaller issues to offer a true GOTY contender. The Witcher 3 has improved on nearly every facet of the previous games. The combat offers a visceral experience where proper preparation can mean the difference between victory and defeat. Making effective use of your signs, potions and oils and knowing whether to use steel or silver adds a higher level of immersion to fighting the world's many monsters. CD Projekt Red have crafted a rich world full of fantasy, ambiguity and political intrigue. Even the seemingly smallest of tasks can become elaborate quests. The Bloody Baron quest line in particular is unforgettable. The storytelling, voice acting and relationships Geralt has make the world feel tangible and believable. The change to open world meant a means of fast travel was needed. Of course you can travel via signposts or you can get where you need to go on your trusty steed Roach. The game can be quite serious but also knows when to have a bit of fun and humor as well. You can participate in fist fights and horse races. You can also play a round of Gwent. I liked the in game card game so much I even ordered the PS4 version of the Witcher 3 just for the Gwent cards. There is so much quality fresh content to be had that never feels like its unnecessary padding. Angry Joe had stated he got more out of the Witcher 3 for the same price he has paid for lesser games. I couldn't agree with him more. CD Projekt Red have also seen fit to offer 16 pieces of free DLC as well",10,2016-08-07,PC,user
Haluk_C,"This game is amazing. I usually just cling onto Online multiplayer games, but i've literally been playing this game past week none-stop. Amazing story, Amazing graphics. Don't loose out on this game. 10/10 I have trouble at time's steering the horse. The auto-pathing while riding sometimes works as intended and other times not. You can't run through objects which is a good thing. As it makes the game more realistic. The other thing that annoys me is that it's very hard to aim with the x-bow/bombs. These are minor flaws which doesn't take anything away from the game itself. It's very well polished.",10,2016-08-07,PC,user

KalrocVN,"If you think that the best fantasy RPGs of the past 10 years are the Witcher 2, Skyrim, and the original Dragon Age, you will LOVE this game. This is, IMO, the greatest fantasy RPG since Ultima 7. Gameplay, voice acting, graphics, world building, storyline... this is an amazing game.

xczar0,"The Witcher 3 made me love RPGs again. And i will play this game again, now in ultra (CDP Red made me buy a new pc just to see how beautiful depicted world will be). And i never re-do computer games, because i hate to know what will happen next. I started playing two games at the same time - Fallout 4 and Witcher 3, just to compare. Fallout worls seemed empty. Although i met monsters, settlers it lacked some spark to fell the world is really alive. In Witcher i had an impression everything has it's purpose. The feeling of ""i have to see what's over there, and there and there"". The story line - amazing. They made a game which has very similar plot style to stories of Mr. Sapkowski. CDP Red mastered art of interconnections between quests and how to place POIs into the map - every explorer should search the surroundings near every question mark. It's amazing how it worked out. Despite some bugs inside it's the best story i've ever get to know in my entire life.",10,2016-07-21,PC,user
Hack,"The Witcher III is an RPG of gigantic proportions, with almost endless content spread throughout a massive and frankly stunning looking world. The starting area at the time felt huge, but it's a microscopic portion of the game, when all is said and done you can easily spend 150 hours in the game if you want to complete everything. Every part of the world is filled with life, be it people or wildlife, and the scenery is truly breathtaking, I often found myself just sitting back in awe of just how good the game looks. The world feels so alive, and this is helped by some truly fantastic voice acting and story telling, riding through a town you will here countless little conversations organically playing out around you, and decisions you make will change the course of the game, so pick wisely! So the game has top notch visuals and audio, unmatched story telling and all the content you could ever want, so what's wrong with it? Well, not much really, in fact the only negative is the movement system, especially on horseback. It's so bad I feel knocking off a point is justified as you spend a lot of time on horseback especially which is by far the worst offender when it comes to movement, as well as AI (Roach will often spawn nowhere near you, on the other side of a wall or just refuse to move at all until you manually mount him). Geralt's movement has been improved since launch with an alternative movement option, and I suggest you use it. I should also mention the game within a game, Gwent. It's a card game that you can play against NPCs throughout the game, think similar to Hearthstone. It's very easy to pick up but quite hard to master, you will need to use sound strategy to beat the harder opponents. You can get lost Gwent easily if you're not careful, it's very addictive. To sum up, The Witcher III is up there with the best games of all time, and it's an absolute must buy for anyone who enjoys the RPG genre as it's as close to perfection as possible and you will love every minute of it.",10,2016-07-21,PC,user

D3nn1s_112,"First Word: For me, not being someone buying every MMORG on gaming market, it has been a surprise, that this game would be that awesome. In the following review I will explain, how I justify my rating of 9/10. Story: For giving no spoilers I won't give detail information, but I can tell, that you won't be disappointed if you expect a story with varied characters and twists. 4/5 Character: Like mentioned before, the characters are all different, which makes them very credible and also interesting. The main character is just a legend, his behaviour is nearly always honorable. 5/5 Conversations: Geralts answers are clever and understandable all the time, even, when you choose an answer, being rude. 4,5/5 Graphics: The attention to details is just amazing. Playing on the highest settings is an experience that nobody should ever miss. Whether you look into the sun at the very morning or at a lake, while standing on an island or in the woods; your eyes will thank you. The countryside and the giant size of the world contains a huge number of varied villages, places and missions. 5/5 Handling: To be honest, the only critic point on The Witcher: Wild Hunt. Controling Geralt is often exhausting. Much more complicate, when he rides Roache. 2/5 Battle System: Easy, but makes still a lot of fun. The battles look authentic and the enemys are neither overpowered nor underpowered. In addition, every enemy has own flaws, whereby the diversity is distinguished. 4/5 Music: Mostly awesome, barely irritating 4,5/5",10,2016-07-20,PC,user

The world is immersive; many backstories not only on main characters but also minor ones.

CletusOfDeponia,"I've enjoyed this game to a degree, but alas... it's 5/10 for me. What is a 10/10 game? It's a perfect game, without a single flaw, without a single thing that would force you out of its immersion. It's a game that's bound to make you forget thirst and hunger, and all of your real life problems. It is a game that revolutionises its field and becomes a bastion in the industry of gaming. Unfortunately, what a lot fail to realise is that a 10/10 rating is an exaggeration, even upon the game you very love. The Witcher 3 brings over fifteen hours of dialogue. To many, this is a joy. To me, unfortunately, a burden. If you would like to finish this game, just the main storyline, expect to be laid back for 1/5 of your time, listening to characters talk, listening to a conversation that is out of your control. Surely, you might think there are options of what would you like to say, but much of the game's dialogue follows this format: 1-2 dialogue options in gold font, meaning this option will continue the story. 1-5 options with a grey font, meaning selecting these options will 'tell you more' about whatever you're talking about. To 99% of people this is very appealing. The game literally tells you which dialogue options will change your standing with the character you're talking to. However, in terms of traditional RPG this is very disappointing. If you remember Witcher 1, in which your dialogue options could force a character never to talk to you again, in which your dialogue choices may mean that you fail a quest. In Witcher 3, your hand is held throughout the whole experience. It would be just as effective to remove the dialogue options and make you watch the dialogue without them. Is this the kind of RPG you are all praising? Is this the new bastion of gaming? I must be truly insane, but it's a step back. No longer will you be encouraged to think about what you say: just press the buttons and enjoy the film. A film - yes. This game is an interactive film. Reading some 10/10 reviews you see praises of ""complex narrative"", and statements of Witcher 3 ""feeling like a complex novel you have to struggle through"", so clearly I am just the odd one out, to see that this game is nothing new. However I do agree on the struggling point - you most likely will find yourself struggling through some cheaply-written dialogue that lasts at least twenty minutes, at some point in this game. A game of such length is a risk. On an average playthrough this game is approximately 100 hours long. Meaning that the first hour of your gameplay must be different from the 99th hour of your gameplay, to keep it fresh and engaging. What I really fail to understand, is the plethora of people turning a blind eye on the extreme lack of actual gameplay in this game. - 1st hour or 99th hour: you WILL be using THE SAME fighting method, swordfighting. To make it better, the animations which your character will be fighting with will be THE SAME throughout the whole game, seeing little to no change at all (you may choose to learn a whirlwind move, maybe). Where is the gameplay progression? Why can't the Witcher have the options of learning new moves from other lost schools? - I craft a potion only once in my lifetime. When I meditate, ALL of my potions and bombs magically refill. No matter how many of them I have. One hundred flasks to refill? Why not, it will only take a few shots of dwarven spirit that is literally in every container in the game. Why should I be a witcher at all? Let's start brewing things magically out of thin air and make money like that, screw the monster slaying. - I receive insane amounts of XP for doing storyline missions. Slaying monsters for experience? Well I'll be here until my hair turns white, oh wait, it already is! - Want to earn some money? Do a witcher contract and get paid in around 300 orens! Want some *serious* money? Swim to one of the question marks on the world map in Skellige and you shall find smuggler's treasure there! Sell it to receive at least 2500 orens. - Wait what? How did I know there was treasure in the sea? Oh wait the noticeboard told me! - Oh I found a new sword. Oh wait... my *witcher* sword that I crafted is better than 99% of the swords in this game... - Oh yay I have over 10000 herbs, tens of armour items and tens of swords in my inventory that I shouldn't use cause they're crap, oh wait but they will sell for a fortune! - I am richer than a king!!!! I just read noticeboards and find treasures! Screw witcher work! - For some reason, everyone I know keeps explaining things to me... Maybe because I haven't read the novels? - Hmmm maybe I should prepare for the next battle? Oh wait, why should I? I'll just open my inventory and drink potions while I am doing a back flip? - Can I do a backflip? Probably not, I forgot how to do that since Witcher 1. I like the game, but it's mediocre. Open world interactive film- not an RPG. Save yourself money and look on YouTube for ""Witcher 3 Film"".",5,2016-07-06,PC,user

I think I have played The Witcher 3 a lot more than my favorite Zelda games, and that is saying a lot. This game delivers a unique sense of immersion in a videogame, a quality I hold among the most important features in a videogame. The quests are well crafted, the characters and dialogues are amazing, the combat system is clever and very flexible...

Witcher movement and combat is clunky and quests are for the huge part all the same: get the quest, follow the red paint on the ground, kill the monster, go back to collect the reward. Level up system... there's not even a slightest difference in gameplay whether you're level 1 or 30. Fighting enemies below your level is boring as they can barely hurt you and fighting enemies with higher level is frustrating as you can barely hurt them.

HapaxLegomenon,"My personal maxim when it comes to games is: Gameplay is king; Story is queen. I have little to no interest in games with no story or even lore; and also no interest in games with only story (I'd rather read a book in that case). The seamless combination of both is what interests me the most, and very few games achieve this blend as Wild Hunt has achieved. This game is the embodiment of the perfect balance between gameplay and story. CDPR, the developer, has achieved the highest effect a game can have on its players: making them wish that it never ends. For the last five months I have delayed and put off the ending as long as I possibly could, wishing that this game could last forever; that I could play it for the rest of my life, always finding new side quests, new contracts, new treasure hunts. But alas, all great things must end; it's what makes them great. And in this case, The Witcher series ended on an incredibly high note. The fact that the developer has decided to conclude the story of Geralt with this game, instead of finding a way to milk the franchise also speaks volumes of their integrity as artists. This is a game that is exuberantly alive: it bustles and teems with life. Walking through the woods, walking through a city, into a cave... you feel life around you, especially if you play with a good headset. The feeling of riding across the lands as the sun sets is something I'll never forget. I'd never played a game that felt so alive, so rich, so handcrafted in its minutest details. Some games came close, but probably due to limitations of technology and development cycle, they didn't achieve this level of liveliness and exuberance. I usually don't like cutscenes in most games, to be very honest, but in this game I couldn't get enough of it. The voice acting, the character animation, especially facial animation, is beyond anything we've come to expect from games in terms of quality, and most games now pale in comparison, seeming lifeless and dull. No wonder some critics said that it ""defines next-gen"": this game is technically and artistically unparalleled, and it should set a gold standard to be aspired to by all AAA devs in the coming years. Not that most of them will ever achieve something this great, but they should at least aspire to greatness. It has moments where its writing is at its best the fewer words are used: Geralt and Ciri trashing a certain place was particularly brilliant. But the writing here is among the best a game has ever seen. From my own personal preference, only the writing in Fallout: New Vegas could equal the writing in Wild Hunt. The variety of soundbites in cities and villages, the different personalities ascribed to vendors (a blacksmith mourning his son, an armourer who is not what he seems, a grumpy merchant, etc etc etc)... From the very first quests, the inner life shown by these characters is simply staggering: a lone hunter in the woods, a very minor character, who considers himself a freak, has more inner life than most protagonists in most games out there. On to the gameplay. The investigation component, though not exactly innovative, is employed so deftly that it makes for one of the most satisfying elements in the game: finding clues and picking up scents is just fun and it makes you feel like a supernatural detective. I know some players had objections to the combat, but I have no complaints whatsoever. Especially on higher difficulties, it is clever, tactical, challenging and just plain fun. You don't have to mash your buttons or click your mouse to death here, instead you have to pace yourself, prepare for each fight, try to get the right oils and signs and bombs ready. It can be awkward sometimes, but that's a matter of skill. The better you become at combat, the more surgical and graceful you can become, which makes it extremely fun and satisfying. The soundtrack is a work of art in itself. For the past two months I've started reading the books while listening to the soundtrack, and it makes for a very satisfying combination. It fills you with longing and transports you to the world of the Witcher while your body sits there in the bus, going to work or wherever. It is that good, seriously. Flawed as only the greatest masterpieces can be, Wild Hunt is a tour de force to be reckoned with. It is a world built by some of the most creative and innovative minds in the games industry; it is a game carved and handcrafted as a labour of love with only the varnish of commercial value. Wild Hunt redeems the videogame medium; it elevates art and storytelling to a whole new level that we can only hope will come to be imitated, however imperfectly.",10,2016-06-11,PC,user
DaedricLord,"Pros: Size-game is huge and you can spend probably 150-200 hours if you want to explore every map marker. I finished the game in about 70-75 hours and had many map markers that were still unexplored. Graphics-really pretty, especially faces and armors, animations are pretty good too. And game performs quite well, my laptop has quad core i7 and GTX970M and I was able to play on 1080p with everything on ultra except foliage distance was high (not much difference anyway) and hairworks were turned off, with nice fps rates generally staying in 40s with occasional drops to 30s and spikes to 50s, more on that in Cons section. I also turned off vignetting, blur and sharpening because I dont like them. You can tweak just about anything to squeeze the fps you want from your computer. Cities are filled with people and look lively and realistic with the exception of repetitive comments from some of them. Quests-nearly every quest has a backstory, and many are interconnected, and while it starts off slowly in White Orchard by the time you move to Velen and Novigrad the game feels like a real living world with well written quests and interconnected stories. Massive improvement over just about any game out there. I immensely enjoyed the quests related to the main quest and didnt have this much fun since Dragon Age Origins&Awakening. Other developers should take note. And many quests require thinking, not too much, just enough to keep quests interesting, but not making you swear in front of your computer all the time because you cant figure it out. Game will also tell you what is the recommended level for a quest, you can manage to do it on lower levels, but not much lower, you get **** if you try it on 10 levels below recommended. Voice acting-generally very good to excellent and pleasure to listen to. Humor-game has lots of humorous moments that are well conceived and entertaining. Rock trolls particularly. Combat-improvement over 1 and 2 and decently enjoyable, gets slightly monotonous after some time but I guess that is caused by restrictions from the books, Geralt fights in certain way and has certain skills and that is all, you cant have spells, new weapons and stuff, there is a crossbow which is a nice addition but not terribly useful except in some situations. Crafting-it is a mixed blessing but I will put in under Pros, you can get some powerful stuff from crafting, but it can be tedious to find recipes, ingredients and right smiths, good for those that like to explore everything in the game, but somewhat tedious for people that just want to enjoy the story and loot or buy their armors and weapons. Scattered treasure-exploring seemingly irrelevant and empty locations can get you powerful armor and weapons, exploring the obscure parts of the map is worthwhile in Witcher 3. Difficulty-now it is much more balanced than in previous games, it has hardcore levels for the fanatics and Just The Story which is the new Easy that allows you to finish the game without too much trouble. If you found 1 and 2 difficult on Easy, no need to worry because 3 is more balanced on Easy and you will be able to enjoy the game in ""tourist mode"" though it is not a walk in the park, you will need to invest a little bit of effort however far less than in 1 and 2. Cons: Graphics-the engine seems to suffer from sudden fps drops here and there, you are in the same area and moved 5 meters yet sometimes the framerate drops by 15-20 fps for no particular reason, good thing is that it is right back up so you dont notice the drop much. Main quest-I found it to be a bit underwhelming and quests that lead to the conclusion much more interesting. Also in one quest writing is off and makes no sense to how a certain character would act, it doesnt fit his personality, lets say it is a quest that involves a king, those who played the game will likely know what I mean. Writing is generally very good but this error made me angry a bit because I liked that character. Dungeon crawling-not much of that in Witcher 3, most locations are above ground and loot is stingy. Economy-making money in Witcher 3 is somewhat difficult, you tend to have a lot of money when you are too powerful anyway and dont need it much. Before that you spend what you earn on obtaining a few items and repairing armor and weapons. Enemies-not too many variants, this could definitely need improvement. Boss enemies are better and usually connected with quests which makes them more interesting. NSFW-they definitely cut down the NSFW content compared to 1 and 2, yes there are still boobs and asses, and you have brothels, but overall NSFW content is not as strong as 1 and 2.

Velgar,"Absolutely amazing game! I have played thousands of different titles in my life, countless RPGs and other story driven games, but the Wither 3 is simply stunning. Hands down my favourite RPG game. Visuals and audio are top notch, you simply can't get enough of watching landscapes, cities and listening to people, nature and music. Combat is fast paced and and satisfying, yet it could be a bit more challenging because even on the hardest difficulty I fare quite well and don't die all that often. This is one of those gems that doesn't let you quit playing like the best book or your favourite series. If you haven't played this one you have to buy if with all the expansions. The best adventure of your life guaranteed.",10,2016-06-04,PC,user
Joey96,"This has been one of the best games that I have ever played, I'm a huge fan of singleplayer games, even though many says that multiplayer is better because of the social part, this RPG doesn't at all. The characters in this game has such deep personalities that one always wants to help everyone. But as the place is set in a place torn by war, no one has anything to spare to help diffierent individuals, the setting of the story is sooooo vast, deep and cunning, yet there is still room for love and romantic moments, for me.... This is like Game of Thrones in game version.",10,2016-06-02,PC,user
kuehnau,"Boring, repetitive, clunky, unwieldy, these are just a few words to describe 'The Witcher 3'. There is no debate that The Witcher 3 is improved from the other two games in the franchise, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't suffer from it's fair share of issues. From it's clunky movement, janky quest tracking, to it's boring story, the repetitive quests, there just isn't a whole lot about Witcher 3 to appreciate.",4,2016-05-30,PC,user

zampaconi,"Quindi, cosa rimane di TW3 una volta finito. Rimane la traccia epica, mentre giro lentamente in cerchio assieme ad un Demonio, scegliendo il momento giusto per colpire. Rimane la tempesta al tramonto, scrutando il mare di Skellige che si frange sulle rocce molte decine di metri più in basso, sotto alle rovine dove mi trovo. Rimane il silenzio di un villaggio abbandonato, dopo che ho abbattuto l'ultimo divoratore di cadaveri che vi aveva scavato la propria tana. Rimane l'impennarsi di Rutilia, in preda al panico per l'apparire della Viverna che si è all'improvviso abbattuta su di noi. Il suono delle campane del porto di Novigrad, la sera. Gli impiccati che dondolano dolcemente sospinti dal vento nella Terra di nessuno. Un licantropo che si vendica sulla sorella traditrice della propria moglie, fatta uccidere con l'inganno da lui stesso. Un altro lupo mannaro, che riesco a ritrasformare in uomo solo per scoprire che tale uomo è più mostruoso della bestia. Alcuni orfani di guerra, che in qualche modo riesco forse a salvare, affidandoli alla vecchia contadina che prima derubavano.

chris247482,"I gave the game a 10, but its closer to a 9.5 as a score. For background I have 76 hours into the game. I got it when it first came out and played for about 30 hours up to around level 14 and then I stopped due to some computer issues. I upgraded my system and went back to the game, but I was rusty and forgot a lot of the systems. The first time I played I powered through on a lot of the main story quests. My character was not well developed and I was broke. Since it has been about a year since I seriously played the game I went back and started from the very beginning. This time I focused on doing all the side quests and taking my time to explore all the corners of the map. I spent time learning how to properly play the card game gwent. I focused on my skill builds and using the mutagens and matching them up. I made the different types of oils and studied the weaknesses of the beasts I would face and the best tactics. I'm at level 12 right now and I haven't even left velen yet. This time through I am seeing tons of side quests and story I missed. The side quest stories are almost as good as the main quest stories. I am totally hooked on gwent this time around and play every npc I can find and am always asking merchants if they have any gwent cards for sale. The level of detail in this game is incredible. From the slow motion kill scenes to watching a enemy you just killed fall into the water and then float back up to the surface or watching an enemy who has just collapse to the ground slowly bleed out leaving a puddle of blood. The stories are phenomenal. Your decisions impact what happens later. Even minor side quests will have me running into people later on who want to talk about the decisions I made. If you like adventure games then this is certainly worth a look even though its an rpg. The graphics are great with some gorgeous scenery. There are some minor downsides. Sometimes combat can be a bit frustrating and could be a bit more fluid. The background music got annoying to the point where I have turned it off. It is fine at first, but after awhile it becomes a bit much. I haven't gotten the expansion and a second expansion is coming up at the end of this month. Right now I am still in the base game and there is a massive amount of game left for me to explore. Hands down this is a quality game and if you have even a passing interest in an immersive rpg then don't even hesitate. Just get this game now. The amount of content is enough to keep anyone busy for months. Just keep in mind that this game is no fairy tale. In fact the game can be quite dark and at times you may make decisions that you think are for the best and much like real life things just go sideways and can't foresee the consequences. Best advice I can give about this game is just take your time and go slow. Explore every area and learn about every system in the game. You don't need to have played the prior games to catch up on the story. Would it add to your pleasure knowing the full back story? I'm sure but it does not seem necessary. The game kinda fills you in on what happened before. I own Witcher 2 and I played it for a bit, but the controls were soo horrible that I just did not get very far into the story. Witcher 3 has a much better control system. This is one of the best games I have picked up in years.",10,2016-05-18,PC,user

Yes, I call it a privilege because it raises the bar so stunning high that most RPGs that come out now feel like watered down garbage. Have you ever wished that you could just pick up the life of someone who's way more interesting than you? That's Witcher 3. In Witcher 3, you play as Geralt, a monster hunter who goes across the lands often times falling into situation where he must make difficult choices . It features a perfectly molded, mature, and exciting story. Side-quests feature their own well-written stories. The combat is fluid and sexy. I suggest playing on the highest difficulty, it makes you use all your arsenal, almost making you think like a Witcher. I've never had more fun playing a game.

""The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt"" provides an unbelievably huge open world, filled with dangerous monsters, well written characters and the best side quests the RPG-genre has to offer. I am still playing it after finishing the story. Even if the main story line could have been better, especially the Wild Hunt didn't feel frightening and dangerous enough to be really memorable villains.

DickTracy,"Many RPGs focus on tales of lone, wandering adventurers, but few if any pull it off it with such artistry as The Witcher 3. That artistry is most apparent in the setting itself, which is so packed with breathtaking sunsets and wind-tossed groves of trees that, months later, I still find myself opting to go to destinations on foot rather than taking the fast travel points. But the true strength of The Witcher 3 is that it populates these memorable landscapes with NPCs doling out humble but memorable quests (by the dozen) that help create one of the most human RPG experiences on the market. In decaying wayside towns, the witcher Geralt might find impoverished elves struggling in the face of local racism; elsewhere, he might help a self-styled baron reunite with his long-estranged daughter. These quests deftly navigate moral issues without being heavy-handed or offering obvious solutions Through it all, much as in The Witcher 2, Geralt usually plays the role of just another character on this troubled world's stage. In the process, this tale of monster slaying and inter-dimensional raiders becomes strangely and poignantly relatable. I'd argue the Witcher 3 is one of the best games ever made. Its writing and micro narratives are so far ahead of its piers it's frankly depressing. It stands as a testament to the skill of CDProjekt Red devs who deeply know and love their craft and allow you to have fun while experiencing war, racism and female sexuality a with a meaningful narrative and haven't devolved into catering and pandering for the masses, leaving the players reflecting on the Witcher world for years to come, as opposed to some jokes of games masquerading as RPGs that will choke to death on 3 pounds of steel.",10,2016-05-09,PC,user

Gamed2long,"I love the Witcher 3. It doesn't condescend like other more adolescent oriented RPGs. Dragon Age Inquisition and all of its teenager ""maturity"" comes to mind. One big aspect of this is the choice and morality of the game. Lots of games will give you superficial choices. Some games, like the mass effect franchise, take it further painting actions as good or bad. But those choices are black and white. Often choice in the Witcher 3 comes to trying to pick the lesser evil. Twice in the game, on insignificant side quests I left someone to die. Once that was a show of mercy, another time an act of cruelty. The same action meaning two different things. Now that is moral complexity. That doesn't condescend. Choice affects who you end up with and how happy, or hearbreaking, the ending is. And its not a few key yes/no moments. A lot more less significant choices build up to the outcome. Its quite well done. The game is not quite perfect, though it certainly is the closest to perfect that currently exists. Combat, though better than the previous two games is still a bit rough. Fighting is designed to avoid click to win, and be more tactical but I could still click to win for the first 1/3 of the game, later too until I dialed the difficulty way up. Enemies can gang up on you, instead of taking turns like the movies or Arkham games, forcing you to plan your fights more tactically. Same with your limited use of healing resources in combat. Some skills on the skill tree are clearly underpowered compared to others, and ""hybrid"" builds are trickier to play despite being truer to the character. Also though character development is awesome in this game, it is actually slightly weaker than Witcher 2. Once you run out of things to say to your chosen or your friend character, you run out of dialogue. That is probably a symptom of the much larger world. When you are interacting with a character as part of a quest it is great and well rounded. Characters change in response to you. Outside of quests, not so much. The world is huge, stunning and beautiful. The water animations, and wind blowing through the trees are beautiful. It feels like a living, breathing world complete with weather systems and dynamic shadows (depending on the amount of daylight and the sun's position in the sky). Overall the game will be off-putting to some people. It is fantasy, but this world is dark, sexist, racist and worse. Some themes will disturb younger viewers. And if you can't get into the combat, I suggest setting it to easy and playing to see the story. Because games this good are few and far between.",9,2016-05-05,PC,user

Magnethead,"This game is as good as the hype and the rating, which is rare. It's huge, it's well written, it's beautiful, the combat is intuitive and hard to master, the acting, the design, everything comes together. It's a rare gem, it really is. If you're looking for a large RPG to really emerge yourself in, this is the best you'll see around. I've played computer games since the 80s and this joins a pantheon of a handful truly stellar games like Civilization I, Thief The Dark Project, Europa Universalis, Baldur's Gate that stand out as true masterpieces of the industry. The only less than brilliant thing in the game is the Skellige area which isn't as astoundingly fantastic as Velen and Novigrad (they are so ridiculously well made with such an attention to detail and life that it's genuinely mind-blowing) but it's still very good. One of the impressive thing is the story-telling, which has become standard in the witcher games but should never be taken for granted anyway. Arguably, we'll never see the level they reached in Witcher I simply because the game is more mainstream now than back then, but the structuring of the narrative is impressive and the choices made and how they affect the final outcome make sense and feel smooth. The only word of caution is that some choices made regarding the romantic outcomes are made very early and are irreversible so if you care a lot about that aspect, I recommend finding a short post about it that doesn't spoil too much before you play the game too far. The choices regarding Ciri's story are just splendid, she comes alive as a complex and loveable character which is really, really hard to achieve for a character that isn't the main protagonist. The main story in general is fantastic as usual, subtle details for the enthusiast, solid telling for the main stream gamer. You can easily spend 250 hours on this game and still have places unexplored. You won't be bored either, it won't feel like they're trying to copy/paste scenarios to stretch the runtime, the game has insane value. Witcher III is a really impressive feat as is the entire franchise series - arguably the best franchise series ever made in gaming.

Sanastusa,"This game deserves all the praise it receives. Fantastic on every aspect of the game with only a small amount of bugs/glitches through the whole thing. It is not surprising it won numerous awards including Game of the Year for 2015. I would recommend playing the previous games (Yes even the first Witcher) to fully get the experience of the story. Story: Geralt is back at it again. Only this time looking even better and can grow a beard. Now equipped with his memory restored you are tasked with finding the child of prophecy. Easy right? Think again. You get to explore 3 beautiful lands that have hidden treasures and plenty of monsters to slay. Inn to Inn squeezing every last coin from a Witcher contract, you find that you are not the only one trying to find this child of prophecy. Just when you think there is enough on your plate, comes the romance triangle from hell. God be with you. Gameplay: A HUGE improvement from the Assassin of Kings. The Wild Hunt finally got the combat correct. The moves felt smooth, using the signs were actually rewarding. You could use Igni to send the enemy up in flames without the huge penalty of death (Witcher 2). They also made the potion aspect of the Witcher profession very enjoyable and highly rewarding. You make the item once and it stays in your inventory, when you meditate you use heavy booze to replenish the charges of said items. Collecting all the oils, potions, and elixirs gave you the edge in battle that it was supposed to. Oh. Gwent. The love that is Gwent. They scrapped the previous little mini games from the last games and gave us something that could be its own game. I spent hours searching for gwent cards and people to destroy with my Nilf deck. Hopefully they look to make it a stand alone title in the future. Bugs/Glitches: Only a few to mention that stood out. Sometimes I would get a hangup in the audio, For example I would be underwater and when I resurface it still sounds like I'm underwater and cant hear properly. It would only clear after I jumped on to my boat and jumped once or twice. Another issue with water; While exploring in Skellige oceans I would get stuck and not be able to perform the dive action. I checked and made sure it wasn't just my game controller, both the keyboard and game controller wouldn't dive. Only thing to fix it would be to save the game and reload the game. Towards the end of the game the audio for hitting with my sword seemed to disappear also. Would only hear it after the 3-4 strike on a person. The damage of course still applied, just the sound was missing.

eclesis,"Overall a big disappointment. On the plus side : The gameplay is solid. The open universe is consistent, well structured and quite beautiful. The city of Novigrad is big, credible and alive. However, beyond that, the game has a lot of weaknesses : - In terms of gameplay, from time to time you will control another character for fight scenes. Since the character is overpowered, there is no challenge and no interest to those sequences that you will suffer till the end of the game. - The difficulty in the game is not consistent and you will find hard press to kill one lonely Archgriffin when on the other side the end boss is a piece of cake. - The main plot is quite bad. It's not epic at all. It's not well written. It has no rhythm. The ending falls flat. - The secondary quest are for the most part not related to the main plot. A big parf ot them are generic and very mmorpg like. By the way, this mmorpg feeling is emphasized the equipment design. Differents colors for common items, magic items, rare tiems, relics, sets. The game boast a large panel of weapons and armors with no soul and identity. - A part of the secondary quests are there to bring back sides characters of the last episodes. However, most of the time it's a botch job and you can't help to feel that the characters are juste here to male a cameo. - Most of the side quests consiste of getting from point A to point B to deliver something then suffer a ton of dialog where your choices will not have a great impact on the game except deprived you of more dialogue if you choose to be roleplay and refuse to do something. So you will take every quest in fear of missing some great part of the story that will never come. - The game introduces a concept of points of interest that you can see on the map. At first you will find it interesting but it will quickly become repetitive and boring. - Your choices and decisions have less impact in this opus than in the previous ones. Only one choice has a true impact on you game experience. Some choices do impact the destiny of countries or side characters but you don't feel a big connection to what happened because it happens a the end, does not affect your experience when you play the game. You can affect the end of the game but the mechanics behind it is very silly (when you read some walkthrough to undesrtand why you get one ending instead of the other). However don't feel sad if you had the bad ending, go to youtube and watch the other endings like everyone else. Don't play the game again since it has no replay value like the previous one (The Witcher 2). - Some will object that a big part of the plot is the father/daughter relationship between the two main protagonists. But this relationship is so weak that its feels like a bad tvserie. It's also true for all the relationships between Geralt and his lovers. - Speaking of choices, you will discover that the choices you made in the previous episodes have no significant impacts on the story. There are only some cameo apparitions. The saddest part it that the whole ""Temeria plotline"" does not take into account ""The La Valette heirs"" and the choices you might have made in the previous episode.",2,2016-04-19,PC,user

elaintahra,"1. It is unplayable mess. The controls are AWFUL to say the least. The combat is so clunky I don't understand what has gone wrong with this development. Graphics are way too taxing = jerky gameplay with even medium settings. (I've got 1,5k€ computer, everything always ultra on other games). Awful narrow fonts. Menu system could do with a redesign. First small hamlet we went in a bar and I walked out there were three guys picking a fight (of course). I tried to jump over a stupid fence but no luck. Instead we end up running around the courtyard. Then they walked off (?) But the worst part, and I've only managed to play three times 20 minutes each, is the godawful nausea that sets in. Now, I am a seasoned player with ~25 hours a week of gaming and I've maybe got sick from 2 or 3 games before. First I thought it was caused by FOV (vanilla has only 60!!). I tried to use MIMM+ ALPHA, Nexus Mod Manager and all FOV mods that I could find but none seemed to work. Now that I think I got one working it still is so yerky movements in the game that its causing me to be physically sick within minutes. I feel also sick by the fact I bought it from store so I can't just refund. Fortunately I will try to get some money back by selling it. Lazy game devs, who omits FOV slider but implements a goddamn hair slider? Maybe if this was a Helloween simulator. If you have similar problems with FOV / Jerky = nausea, by from Steam so you can refund or stay away from this. Why are people giving this 10? I have no idea",1,2016-04-08,PC,user

Snoracks,"The Witcher III: Wild Hunt is amazing. If you have not played it and you have enjoyed open world or story based games before, I would highly recommend it. I had never played any of the Witcher games before it, but I was still able to hop into this vivid world and almost completely understand all the central conflicts of its story. There’s even references to things that did not even happen in the previous games, but in the novels on which the game is based and even those were easy to follow. The decisions are by far my favorite part about the game. In addition to the normal dialog choices you make, there are also decisions of critical importance which have a time limit on your decision, my favorite of which is whether or not to throw a baby in an oven during a side quest. The choices you make generally are not as grandiose as they are in the Mass Effect series, but are in many ways more interesting as they do not follow a good and evil binary. Often your choice is between two options which are not all good and not all bad. The effects of your choices is also sometimes not seen until much later in the game, which ends up being pretty neat. Romance in this game is pretty great, although I still think the first and third Dragon Age games have my favorite romance options. Your main decision is between two Sorceresses, Triss and Yennifer. You have tremendous backstory with both women, which is given to you as you go along and, I assume, if you have played previous games. Now, originally, I thought I would hate that as the blank slate character I normally get in Bioware games allows me to just pick my favorite character in the game and romance them, but this decision is a lot more complex and allows the player to come up with their own point of view for whom Geralt is and what he would do in these situations. Geralt, as a result, is way more three dimensional than Shephard, the Inquisitor, the Grey Warden, hell, even Revan. There are plenty of other romance offerings as well and more nudity than I think I’ve seen in a game of its caliber. The combat is also incredibly complex, but only if you choose for it to be. I started the game on easy and had no problem with anything, but decided later on I wanted some complexity and cranked it up so that I had to learn the interactions and exactly what I was doing. While the combat certainly isn’t the centerpiece for the game, I always found it fun and more exciting than in some Western RPGs. The idea of toxicity and every potion being helpful and harmful at the same time is extremely interesting and on my next playthrough of the game when the next expansion comes out will certainly be potion-based. If you have played Final Fantasy VIII, you have played the best mini game in any video game I have ever played. Triple Triad still might be a bit better, but Gwent gives it a run for its money. Its simplicity makes it easy to learn but it becomes more and more complex over the course of the game. If I had one gripe though it’s that you become totally OP in Gwent as the game goes on. Once you’ve gotten the Geralt of Rivia card, you’re basically unbeatable. Supposedly the Blood and Wine expansion might add more complexity to the game, which I am quite excited about. The game is not without glitches. One treasure hunt I did left me stranded in a remote castle and the way I got through it was to run into an invisible wall and fall until I was off the edge of the world and then it let me fast travel wherever I wanted. Roach (Geralt’s horse) also has some significant glitches in what he can cross and in his animations for a lot of actions. While technically not a glitch, Geralt gets shipwrecked in an area that takes several days to reach by sea and as soon as you can control him again in this new area, you can summon Roach to you, even though there’s nothing to suggest Roach was even on that boat. It was a bit tacky, but I still preferred having Roach there rather than not, so I think it’s 100% forgivable. TL;DR - While there were certain flaws to the game, this game is actually so incredible that I cannot fault it for them. It made me question the blank slate character BioWare always gives you and finally presents a true competitor to their Western RPGs. Gwent rules and so does Geralt.",10,2016-03-30,PC,user

bjoern,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a third-person open-world action RPG. The story of the game is interesting, since it doesn't only show a hero, but also the true ugly side of war. In the open world, there are ridiculously many quests and side quests. A very good aspect is that every quest is associated with a small story. This is much better than in some other RPGs, where you just have to collect something for an anonymous person. Another good aspect is that the game was designed for adults and not cut for children. The game contains serious topics, brutal violence, explicit content. On the XBox One, the game makes a good technical figure: the graphics are nice and the game runs smoothly. All in all, I can fully recommend this game.",10,2016-03-24,PC,user

I NEVER play games for the story (usually couldn't care less) but when one of the main characters meets a sudden end I was devastated - almost save scummed back like 3 hours to alter the story - guess that will be the next playthrough! Never even played more than 2-3 hours of the series (beginning of witcher 1, which didn't speak to me). Go buy it today!",10,2016-03-19,PC,user
karmasleeper,"Arguably the most refined game in the series. Witcher 1 felt like a point and click adventure with terrible combat (and too much of it). Witcher 2 had a story that felt like a cliff hanger interlude, a diversion from the over arching narrative. Witcher 3 caps the series nicely and ties into the novels in a more meaningful way than its predecessors. The open world is divided into a few different areas featuring a good amount of geographic diversity. There is a lot to explore and uncover but it does not feel as rewarding as it should. Weapons and equipment are locked by character level. You can craft the high level items if you have the materials, but you won't be able to use them until much later in the game. Witcher gear is often the best equipment in the game. You ""unlock"" witcher gear by completing Treasure Hunt quests - exploring the game world to find the diagrams so craftsmen can make it for you. Witcher contracts provide your primary source of income - slaying monsters or solving problems usually involving monsters for peasant villagers and the like. Because quests have a recommended level, it can be difficult to get going at first. You can, of course, brave high level quests at a low level, but on higher difficulties this is not advisable. Overall, the story is very good. It ties into characters from the novels not featured in previous games. Due to the open world mechanic, the pacing of the story will vary with how much emphasis the player places on pursuing the main quest or getting lost in side quests and activities. Players who spend their time trying to eek out everything the world has to offer might feel the game has poor pacing. It's difficult to care about the urgency of the main quest when Geralt is more concerned about doing side jobs or playing card games with NPCs. Many quests have surprisingly well written twists in the narrative. Things are often very cynical and this gets repetitive. I also felt this way about the novels in general. The writers for this game have emulated the author's writing style so well some side plots or twists in the narrative become very predictable. Character leveling allows for a wide variety of builds on three archetypes - combat, signs, and alchemy. You can mix and match to your heart's content. You get 1 skill point per level but can accumulate more through world exploration. Combat is fluid and responsive. A great variety in enemies requires a great variety in tactics. You can drink potions in combat again and switching between equipment is very easy with the pop up wheel. The mouse and keyboard controls are fine but I found the game a lot more enjoyable with a game pad. Parrying or deflecting arrows no longer consumes stamina - only signs do. Every time you meditate, alcohol is consumed to replenish both potions and bombs. Overall great game. Some people might wish exploring the world yielded more XP or material reward. The game's length is somewhat artificially padded by requiring you to pursue side activities in order to advance your character or produce/procure supplies. This could lead to pacing issues for some people. Great, if sometimes predictable, story with memorable characters and events.",8,2016-03-18,PC,user

vballguy777,"The most rewarding, deep, content rich, and fun games I have played in a long time. In an era where game devs are cutting corners, charging microtransactions in full $60 games, and recycling previous innovations, this game shines as the new standard for open world RPGs. This game has every technical marvel you could ask for too with some of the very best graphics to date. It is not a perfect game, you can outlevel enemies and feel overpowered if you are doing tons of side quests so play on hard to keep the fear of death, you occasionally find small glitches, and keyboard controls might be frustrating to learn at first but that is because there are so many options in combat. These issues are so small and far in between though when compared to the sheer value of this game. Not to mention free DLC! If you love stories this is a great one. If you love open world RPGs this is your game. I originally bought this for the Xbox 1 because I didn't have my PC yet and loved it so much that I bought it for the PC as well once I got it.

KingMob4313,"Yet another console to PC conversion that misses the mark: No FOV settings, horrible controls, grotesquely bad graphics and simply no way to play it keyboard and mouse. I would have persisted through this game, since I've played much worse games, but nothing in the gameplay, story or progression is compelling enough to continue. First the story: the characters are boring, quests grinding and story lacks direction or focus. Character interaction is a neverending parade of inane characters and plastic-flat conversations. The gameplay is also clumsy and frustrating, with most battles consisting of constant roll-spamming and button mashing -- Batman game this is not. Strategy in the game amounts to simply save scumming so that you have prescient understanding of the next encounter that will happen in the game. I simply cannot understand how this game is this highly rated. It is worse than Alpha Protocol. Maybe everyone is distracted by the hilariously bad polygon breasts and awkward sex scenes?

danstew,"It seems futile to even write a review about this game, considering how successful and critically acclaimed it is. Still, I'd like to share my opinion, and hope it is helpful. If someone was to ask me what my favorite game this year was (even though there are still six weeks left before 2016, and at least one more game that I am interested in will be released this year), it has to be this one. This is actually my second review... I deleted the first one, as I just started my second playthrough. I got the game when it first came out, finished it and had a blast, enjoying it tremendously. I wasn't sure how much replay value this would have, but starting another playthrough, I realize it's almost as much fun as the first time, even though you know the reveals etc. I will make different choices this time, seeing how much things will change when I do. In a nutshell: - Graphics are beautiful and very atmospheric, and the game is well optimized. I have an i7 4790, 16 gigs of RAM, a GTX 960 with 4 GB RAM. The first time I played this, I still had a GT730, and even with that card, I was able to play the game and it looked nice. With the 960, it's even more beautiful. - The soundtrack is totally awesome IMO - Difficulty ofc depends on what you pick, but I thought it was fun, challenging without being unfair. You will need to do some research (in game) on the different kind of monsters, using oils and stuff, and figuring out what you'll be fighting (contracts) is very cool... I love that moment when I know what I am fighting, meditate, go to the haunted spot and hear the monster approach. - This game has some AMAZING writing. The characters are sometimes quite mysterious, and IMO not as cliche as you see in so many other games. They might be evil, but often have a soft spot, or a reason for their behaviour, or do something unexpected. So many dramatic stories here, and the storyline in general is VERY well-written - So much stuff to do. Some of it can be a tiny bit grindy, but on my first playthrough, I did pretty much every bit of side-content until I eventually moved ahead and focussed more on the story. - No glitches, no crashes, only one bugged event (Geralt drew a sword, but it wasnt in his hand, so I didn't do any damage. Happened ONCE) - The atmosphere... omg, it's hard to explain really. I have no idea why but the world of the Witcher, the setting, the landscapes and towns captivated me right away. There is a quite dark and foreboding vibe to the world... riding through the forests at dusk, with rain coming down and the wind blowing... it's SO well done, so very beautiful. MGS, AK, FO4...none of these games captivated me even half as much. I am not sure whether its the graphics, the design, the music, the writing, or a mix of all that, it just **** me right in. - Replayability. I started playing when the game came out, and now, about half a year later, I started another playthrough. And it's FUN. Yes, of course I now know all the big reveals of the main story, but still, it's fun to play it again. Will try a slightly different spec and playstyle this time (because you can eg. focus on swordplay or signs or the other weapons, mix them the way you like. My first build was relying very much on signs, using Igni and mind-controlling enemies). - DLC... check out the list of FREE DLC that the devs have added. I was blown away when I reinstalled the game and saw quite a list of free DLC. Some of it minor, some adding quests etc. Plus, the first expansion adds SO much to the game, it's amazing, especially considering the price. - Controls are... a bit wonky. Have a bit of that ""drunk"" feeling, a bit too rough and inaccurate. You eventually get used to it, but compared to games like the Arkham Knight or some of the AC games (and these games have control issues as well, mind you!), it felt a bit too...loose. Pros: - Graphics and optimization - Amount of content - Music and sound - Story and writing (!!!!) - Fights - Very mature topics, things you don't have in games too often Cons: - Lore and stories might be a bit confusing to newcomers to the franchise - Same for crafting, inventory management, alchemy - Wonky controls, not quite precise enough",10,2016-02-15,PC,user

captainkane,"I enjoy The Witcher games. They’re based on Polish stories which gained tremendous popularity after the launch of The Witcher PC game in 2007. Over the past 9 years, CD Projekt has emerged from obscurity to give bloated, entrenched developers a run for their money. Although the franchise has definitely matured, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt exhibits shortcomings that shouldn’t exist in a third installment. What makes TW3 so good? Foremost, this is the first open world Witcher game. The world is huge, beautiful, atmospheric, and treacherous. Graphically, TW3 is impressive. Environments feel alive. Observing a town from atop a snowy mountain is breathtaking, and wandering around thru the swamps at dusk is downright creepy. As the wind howls, branches and small plants sway as the sound of creaking limbs fills the air. Despite claims from ardent fans, TW3 isn’t the best looking game ever. But it runs incredibly smooth. Even my aging PC pushes out 50-60fps at Ultra settings, which is impressive given the complexity of the environs. Dragon Age: Inquisition launched 6 months before TW3, but it conjures up a less interesting world while delivering terrible performance. Secondly, the soundtrack is phenomenal. Several Polish composers and the folk band Percival collaborated to create distinctly Slavic tunes. The original Witcher had a remarkable soundtrack, but TW3 surpasses it. At times the score is nearly understated, and that’s why it’s so potent. No male choruses shouting chats or drums beating at full intensity. At harder difficulties, even minor battles feel epic as Lazare plays in the background. Thirdly, there’s a ton to do. There are dozens and dozens of missions. Plus, there are witcher contracts, horse racing, boxing, and the fabulous Gwent. Gwent is a card game vaguely similar to Hearthstone. Players spar against npc’s in order to win better cards and a bit of coin. Early on Gwent is difficult, but as players build their decks, it becomes quite fun. Players can adjust Gwent’s difficulty in the menus, which is advisable for casual gamers. Completing quests is imperative for leveling up. Enemies yield little XP, so farming for XP is futile. But the Witcher 3 isn’t perfect. Most noticeably, the combat ****. The hero Geralt feels weak compared to the previous games. Spell usage is severely hampered, and potions lack lasting effects. Even at high levels, Geralt can only slot a handful of abilities. To make matters worse, players must swap needed abilities BEFORE fights because they’re locked once battle begins. If Geralt comes across bandits and arrow deflection isn’t slotted, he’s in for a rough time. The leveling system is counterintuitive and artificially difficult because it’s poorly designed. I especially hate how choosing passive abilities eliminates slots for active ones. Stats are poorly explained. Playing as Ciri is even worse. Overall, combat is not fun most of the time, and that’s unfortunate because 90% of TW3 is combat! People who quit playing TW3 said combat is its biggest drawback. This problem plagues every Witcher game. There’s no excuse. Lords of the Fallen was created by a former CD Projekt developer, and its combat is infinitely better. Next, the story is OK, but there are too many loose ends. TW3 teases at romances that never mature. Players are pitted with “difficult” choices which ultimately have zero impact. Even important choices from The Witcher 2 make little difference. Also, newcomers will be lost because the game assumes players read the novels already. Many characters have backstories, but these are never fleshed out in game. So dialogue is confusing. Other popular characters have simply vanished. These gaps lessen the emotional impact of the overall story and choices being made. Many fans have voiced the same opinions. CD Projekt has acknowledged them, but very little can be done at this point. Rewards for completing quests are uneven. I completed a brief sidequest and earned 685 points. Then I completed a main story mission that was 5 levels higher, more complex, and 80 minutes longer, only to gain a mere 35 points. Most loot players earn from quests is useless. Some missions reward no points/loot at all. So the rewards for completing many missions are scant. The higher Geralt’s level, the more miniscule 25 XP points become. Scavenging and crafting are the only ways to net good gear. Lastly, despite 20gb+ of patches, TW3 is still buggy. Bugs affect every aspect of the game. After launch, I stopped playing because it was nearly unplayable. TW3 is playable now. Obviously CD Projekt pushed it out too soon and they’ve been patching it up ever since. TW3 is a solid game after patches. It’s atmospheric and epic, but that doesn’t merit a free pass. Mediocre combat, uneven pacing, bugs, weak leveling and missing backstories are a few problems that plague this venerable game. The Witcher 3 needed to cook for another year. It’s still fun, but only Witcher apologists give it 10/10.",7,2016-01-26,PC,user
idikov,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is in my eyes a near perfect game. If you haven't picked it up yet, I strongly recommend that you do, even if you haven't played the previous installments in the franchise. (I hadn't played the first two games and I enjoyed it thoroughly) It is rare for a game to deliver so much on every aspect. I am confident that The Witcher 3 will be regarded as one of the best games of the decade and will serve as a hallmark for future games in the genre. The Witcher 3 is the ultimate culmination of the fantasy franchise. It is a result of the continued hard work of a small Polish studio that listened to the feedback of the community and aimed only to deliver the product that the fans wanted. With every next game they used the profits from the previous one to bring the franchise to a higher level. This is what The Witcher 3 is: a full-fledged experience resulting from the hard work and clever investment of CD Project Red. This is, without a doubt, the best money proposition of 2015. The game contains 150-200 hours of quality gameplay: All characters are interesting and well written, The quests are unique and entertaining; The combat is fluid and at the higher difficulty demands skill and concentration; The graphics are stunning while not too taxing; The music is enchanting and authentic; The voiceo-vers are delivered professionally and cast correctly; There is an incentive for multiple playthroughs as there are many branching quests and a single action may sometimes lead to the death of a main character, there are also a few endings. Overall, the game does not lack in any department and will keep both loyal fans and newcomers to the franchise interested in the story and sympathizing with the characters.",10,2016-01-26,PC,user

jimbobslimbob,"You know a game is good when it has you hooked after only 30 minutes of game-time. This game did that to me. Yes, it really is as good as everyone claims. It's one of those games you simply cannot put down. I found myself thinking about it way too much and itch to get back to playing it. Not many games do that these days, but this is definitely one of them. Graphically, it looks absolutely astonishing. The environment, characters, textures, attention to detail, god, even the hair looks amazing. The weather and day/night effects are also top notch. You can truly get ""lost"" in a game world as lovingly crafted as this one. The music is also very well done, it fits perfectly with the game and really helps to set the tone and emotional impact of certain events and areas. Truly, not enough praise is given to it, but trust me, it's really well done. Voice-overs are also a strong-point here. The characters (especially the ""main"" ones) are done extremely well and really help to immerse you in the world and form attachments with the characters. The story and quests are also very well put together. Much less of the ""go here, fetch this"" crap that most RPG's use to pad out a game with content and much more involved and intriguing stories that mean just as much as the main quests in some cases. The addition of specific Witcher contracts, which allow you to go full on detective are also great fun. Some of these require a little research and preparation, rather than just running to a point on the map and button-mashing, giving them a surprisingly deep and complex vibe. There is also lots of content to keep you entertained - and as stated above, it's not just rubbish padding (I am looking at you, DAI). At this point I am really struggling to find much wrong with the game. I suppose the only thing that is a little lacklustre is the combat - which can be great sometimes, or very frustrating at others. It could do with a little polishing given the amount of it in the game, but it is by no means a deal-breaker - and certainly an improvement over Witcher 2's. To be honest, it grows on you as well - being quite different to most RPG's I have played, but once you get used to it, suddenly it all seems to come together and work. So really, this is nitpicking. I found the keyboard and mouse controls difficult to get to grips with, but a few rebinds later and all was well (dodge key being bound to Alt by default was a personal bugbear). Also be sure to turn on ""Hardware Mouse"", or else the mouse never feels ""right"". Quite why it is defaulted to ""off"" to begin with, I don't understand. The ""Gwent"" mini-game also never captured me (I just avoid it wherever possible). This is personal taste however, and a lot of people seem to really enjoy it. Never quite clicked with me though. Each to their own. Thankfully you can just skip these - including the ""find them all"" quest related to collecting every card in the game. So what we have here is an optional feature that some will love and play (no con to the game) and others will not like and skip (no con again), making this whole ""issue"" a non-issue. Yep, that's it. I honestly cannot name anymore cons. Absolutely everything else about this game is good - better than good. So, all in-all, this could well be one of the best RPG's I have played in a long time. It is nothing short of a masterpiece. I don't give away 10/10 ratings often, but this game deserves it. P.S.

Get your balls together and make someting good or be forgotten like many companies.",10,2016-01-17,PC,user
Wulfas,"Since i haven't finished Witcher 1, but completed Witcher 2 and didn't necessarily thought the game was really that good. Didn't had a lot of expectations or hype before the game came out, but this game got me hooked from the first 10 minutes, not to even mentioning beautiful world and environment's, but the atmosphere and music is amazing already in the start of the game. All of the quests are very interesting and unique although later on some of the quests might seem repetitive. There is really a lot of things to do and every part of the map feels unique and well thought out. The game play and mechanics are really polished and responsive, and every fights seems interesting and amazing, i had a lot of fights were i thought i will die, but as soon as you figure out how can you counter enemy you will be set to go. Now the only bad thing about this game i didn't like is the fast travel markers, i thought that some of the markers was either put too close to one another or too far from each other. Having set all of this, i really think that The Witcher 3 deserves all the awards that it got, because the game is truly a marvel. The story in this game is really great and unique, although ending was so good and feels kinda rushed. The world itself is very unique filed with lore and monsters from Slavic folklore. This game is true RPG and feels like Mass Effect and Dragon Age had a baby with only the good features. I would recommend this game to anyone who loves a good book, because as you play you feel like you are the protagonist of a very good novel.",10,2016-01-16,PC,user
skeith,"This is the Best RPG so far. I need to first mention the sidequests, this game has so many great sidequests that are so detailed and well written they are better than the main quests of some lesser games. The main story is very engaging, and the game provides you a huge number of interesting characters, I won't name them out for I do not want to spoil you. The game world is very beautiful and has many secrets, secret under water cave, secret mountain path. The soundtrack is just awesome and comfortable. Really, A must play for RPG fans.Variable combat style, whether you like to use magics, brute force, a guru of potions or agility. You can find different style for battle.",10,2016-01-15,PC,user
NoPeace,"Its a shame that the gaming journalism industry is on Bethesda's payroll. This game deserves the game of the year award. The story is solid, the gameplay is very fun and satisfying.

After 2nd expansion, Wind and Blood they will probably release other tools based on REDkit which will let moders to change basicly anything in that game. Stop telling **** If anything is wrong with new patch, will be fixed as soon as possible. This game is easly GOTY 2015, no doubt! Also, best in terms quality for price!

I forced myself to play this game because the reviews were so glowing and I am so glad I did. This was one of (if not the) best games I have ever played. The fighting is super fun, I LOVE looting, the characters are amazing in both appearance and substance, I was obsessed with finding diagrams and recipes, crafting is super addictive and leveling up was a joy. I love getting a new sword or outfit to strut about in. Just got a new computer and it just looks so pretty on it. My only problem was that the you don't get enough slots for perks so at the end of the game it's less fun (because leveling up becomes pointless)",10,2016-01-03,PC,user

Jason210,"I thin there are enough reviews out there singing to the merits of this game, so there is no need for me to add more to those. Rather, I'm just here to explain why I gave it a 9 rather than a 10. It's just small things I'm picking on really, which had they been right, would have made this a perfect game. Currently, some of these problems can be modded away and some can't. Firstly, the nights have been designed to be quite bright. Instead of seeing true darkness, we look at the a daytime world through a kind of blue filter. This is a design decision that is quite common in these kind of games simply because the majority of players seem to want it. For me, it destroys the immersion. I like dungeons and nights to be so dark that I need lanterns to see around. It's more realistic and scary! Secondly, there are few immersive touches that I feel are missing, such as the ability to on chairs and benches like you can in Skyrim. These simple, pointless actions are half the fun in role playing games for me. It's a pity Witcher 3 is complicated to mod. If it were as easy to mod as an Elder Scrolls game, I would have not brought up these points.",9,2016-01-01,PC,user
phuck-overkill,"Pros: Just about everything about this game is incredible. Even with the unfortunate graphical downgrade it still looks amazing. The story, characters, and setting are just incredible and lifelike, this game really pulled me into its world. A single playthrough will take you about 70-80 hours if you rush, and can easily break 100 hours if you explore everything. CD Projekt Red are my favorite developer right now, for good reason. Not just for the quality work they've done with the Witcher series but also because of their business practices. They continued to support the game by releasing free DLC which included new armor sets, hair/facial hair options, outfits for other NPCs, weaponry, AND new quests. All that for free, in this day and age? It's wonderful. In addition, they are releasing 2 expansion packs. Actual expansion packs with new locations, characters, storylines, and so many more hours of content. They really lift my spirits when seemingly almost every other developer/publisher wants to just defecate out a game, and support it for a limited time with paid DLC. Cons: The only downside to this game that I see most people complain about is the combat. I can understand why, it is sort of basic. You're essentially limited to swords (although there are axes, their stats are almost always outclassed by Witcher swords) and the crossbows are more of a tool to stumble enemies/bring down flying enemies. But there are some other ways to make combat more interesting. Witcher signs (spells) that you can cast, and potions to collect and craft. All in all it was good enough for me. Other Thoughts: I highly recommend this game. I enjoyed this game so much that I regret getting it for free via an Nvidia promotion, but I will definitely be buying the GOTY edition when it comes out.",10,2015-12-30,PC,user

While no game is ever perfect, The Witcher 3 is the closet thing I've ever played that approaches that mystical mark. I enjoyed playing Witcher and Witcher 2, but Witcher 3 easily outshines them. The open world concept that CD Projekt Red presented surpasses even DA: Inquistion, which is one of my all time favorite games. For me, as a PC gamer, I was impressed seeing one of the most remarkable games of all times being released completely DRM free.

The music is fantastic, and the graphics are great while but wont completely kick your computers ass.

MrRelyt,"A gorgeous game set in a dark universe where you play as a legendary Witcher 'Geralt of Rivia'. The Witcher 3 excels in almost every aspect imaginable. The Setting - CD Project Red (The Devs) really out-did themselves on the setting. The game is absolutely gorgeous, but also presents you with exactly the setting you would want in a monster-slaying game: dark, foggy, disturbing. Also, there is a lot of swamps and snowy valleys. I like both. The Characters - Just, wonderful. Almost every single character in this game manages to be somewhat interesting. The voice acting (especially for the important characters) is similar to that you'd expect of a movie, and the scripts almost never fail to be convincing. A character never acted irrationally (unless that's what they were supposed to do.) Gameplay - The gameplay is fast, punishing, and fun. Fighting against humans isn't nearly as fun as fighting against monsters: taking down a griffin is far more exhilarating than a bandit. Nevertheless preparing for a battle with oils, and potions, then engaging in difficult combat is great. If you enjoy dodging, evading (like dodging, but side stepping instead of rolling) and blocking while deciding when to deliver a powerful attack, you will enjoy the gameplay. The Story - Definitely the games strongest element (and I'd give all the other aspects 9-10's). Never once was I intrigued by the story. Every single time I made a crucial decision, I knew it could have massive ramifications later on into the game - and that was awesome. Playing The Witcher 3 never felt like a chore, unlike many other games. Bugs/Performance - Eh, I didn't expect any bugs. The game is a little demanding, but it is acceptable seeing as how beautiful the game is. One of the best Story-Driven RPG's ever made.",10,2015-12-26,PC,user
Derf3L,"One of the best games I ever played (if not the best one). I come from reading the books and playing the previous 2 games, so this one had a particular importance for me. It didn't disappoint me at all and gave a deserved ending to this great story. I feel very empty now that I finished it! - The story is great, reconnecting so much with the books. It keeps you involved from beginning to end. - Graphics are crazy and detailed in every way. - Sound track? no words, these songs are still playing in my head!! - Gameplay is very solid and combat is really fun! - World is really huge and there is so much exploration.. Don't know what else to say. They made a masterpiece. I clocked at around 120 hours, finished all quests and left out only the ""?"" in the sea of Skellige. Negative sides? Personally just 2: - Controls sometimes are a bit clunky (horse controls, cliffs,etc.) - I guess this is the price to pay for making an Open world game for the 1st time CD Project - World is very grim and dark, maybe a bit too much? To conclude: it's a must have. I'll jump straight into the DLC!",10,2015-12-25,PC,user
TimW001,"An immersive story line, unforgettable quests and character, a thriving universe. A near perfect game. It truly feels that this is a real world existing and I am in the middle of a larger war, rather than being the most important piece of the war. The people and characters and interactions are great. The combat is also a lot of fun against a good mix of humans of monsters. In combat one has the choice to mix magic attacks with explosives, or just slash harshly with a blade. It is a classic which should net a player upwards of eighty hours of fun and challenging gameplay.",10,2015-12-24,PC,user

ianlitchfield,"Hard to know what to add to what most people are telling you. TW3 seems more than just a game, it's alive, alive with beauty, with activity all around, it **** you in and doesn't want to let you go, and when eventually you do pause for food or the toilet the real world seems drab and dull in comparison. This is a game that makes you want to learn to ride a horse, strap on a couple of swords and go explore the mountains of Scotland (which look a lot like Skellige). The main story is absolutely gripping, so hard to leave it and carry out the side quests which you really need to to level up, but then the side quests are just as gripping, the Red Baron quest is worthy of it's own game alone. I've been playing video games since the 1970s and in all that time I've tried every genre, RPG was never my favourite, always preferred FPS, but I can in all honesty say that in the last 40 years of gaming TW3 is hands down the most immersive, most well written, most beautiful, most heart wrenching, most moving, and the most lovingly crafted computer game I've ever had the privilege to play. Thank you CD Projekt Red.",10,2015-12-23,PC,user
Rational-Review,"Having spent over 60 hours in each of the first two entries of the trilogy, I've more than tripled that time in the final chapter of this mesmerizing, highly addictive story. The developers listen to their consumers, and they craft the game desired with a refined etiquette and humorous commentary. No game is perfect upon release, but the devs are passionate and patched swiftly, also holding to their promise by offering an unprecedented level of free DLC. And while I can't think of any reason to give yet another highly positive review, the title isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea. While you are constantly surrounded by new and familiar faces, your character is alone. Maybe that's not a bad thing, but sometimes some party banter is helpful when it's too quiet. Yet, there rarely is a dull moment. The crafting system has gone through some revision and inventory management has improved. The look and feel of the world is unparalleled in my gaming experience, but it is the story and its characters which make this a truly awesome title to become immersed in over the holiday if you are looking for a different kind of cheer.",9,2015-12-22,PC,user

azarielrdm,"So i'm about 70 hours into Witcher 3. I'm guessing about 40% through the story and maybe 30% through the total content. I mean, it's open world and there's like 300 points of interest ranging from treasure to new quests. And I'm still sticking by it is the BEST GAME EVER MADE. CD Projekt Red is now my favorite dev, i mean there's so much to do!! There's more voice acting than SWTOR and skyrim combined. Graphics are gorgeous, music is incredible, open world, combat is fun and reactive, Geralt is an awesome character badass, tons of armor and weapons models to keep you feeling like you're the monster killer you are. I'm so addicted I play for 10 hours a day sometimes. Been up until 5am like 3 times so my sleep is totally screwed. I just want to keep doing more stuff! That's how a game should be. Literally the only complaint I have is the horse you ride. He's dumb. He spawns in bad places, and always behind the camera so he's never where you are heading when you whistle for him. And sloped terrain is a **** nightmare sometimes. Although he is necessary and helpful to a big degree. And he does have an autopilot if you're on a road. And there is fast travel but only from road signs. Read a synopsis of the other 2 games if you don't want to play them, really the events in those games are standalone and it's only cool to see old characters you've met before in the other games. I wholeheartedly recommend this game whatever the price is. It's near perfect. There is no game better of its type and is strongly competing with Chrono Trigger as my favorite of all time. A very rare 10/10 for me.",10,2015-12-19,PC,user

Zen-Zinxe,"The Witcher 3, this game is a testament to how far games have come. I actually feel sorry for any game that tries to do open world RPG after this. It's painfully obvious that CDPR has blown everyone out of the water. Here's why: The game is open world, and has better graphics than most linear games, even DESPITE the graphics downgrade (which DID happen). The game looks and feels like a handcrafted world, the entire game world is beyond beautiful, like nothing I have ever seen before. I thought the witcher 2 was amazing, the witcher 2 was definitely great looking, but it did not have the scope that TW3 has. TW3 has a world that feels completely real and alive. That feeling of ""copy pasted"" areas is just not there. The npcs. People will call out to you when you ride/walk by if they want your help, the faces in the witcher are many and varied. Even after doing nearly every quest I came across I never felt like I was talking to the same person with a different outfit. Everyone in the game already has their own thing to do, and their own agenda. Nobody is really just standing around waiting for YOU. The story. This isn't something you want to play while barely paying attention. The time investment needed to finish this game is massive. I started my playthrough on the hardest difficulty, and it took me about 150 hours to beat the game, while skipping many contracts and a vast majority of markers on the maps. Whenever I sat down to play the game, I wanted to make sure I had no other distractions. This game takes work to beat, and it's largely due to the fact that I didn't want to miss a thing while I was playing, finding the time to commit to this game was not easy, but well worth it. The game is not perfect. It suffers from the typical open world game issues (clipping, weird camera angles sometimes, a slightly misplaced object or two), for example I found a tree floating a few feet above the ground in the first area, however that was the ONLY example I found of that. Even with these little issues, as far as open world games go, nothing has the fidelity that I have witnessed in the Witcher 3. The controls are a bit clunky, I felt as though the Witcher 2 was more responsive, but the Witcher 3's clunkyness appears to be the result of an attempt to make realistic movement/combat animations that flow together, not the result of bad controls. I have to say, once you get used to the pace of combat and the style of movement, I found myself enjoying the realistic style of responsiveness. This is a story driven game, if you cannot get into the story you will probably not enjoy the game that much. I feel like I have barely even touched the surface as to why this game is so good. I feel like I can't appropriately describe it. I will say this though, that this is what gaming needs, a game that pushes the boundaries of what we've seen before. I can say with certainty that I have never seen a world so vast and believable, so alive and vibrant. I've never had a game make me feel so small and insignificant. Playing the witcher 3 was like having a second life for 5 months. There was so much going on in the world of the witcher 3, and I didn't even manage to see all of it. As of right now, december of 2015, this game has no equal within the genre of open world RPG's. That is what I think.",10,2015-12-11,PC,user

There are several special gear sets to be found increasing various stats, each feels worth exploring for. -Dialog - Some of the best and varied since Mass Effect -Graphics - Rivaling the best of games granted your PC is up for the task. -Quest variety - The best I've seen in an RPG. A few quest groups, but each with their own deep story and detail. The game is a little 'hand-holdy' in terms of quest markers and such; I'm unaware of an remove marker feature. This is certainly no deterrent. I wouldn't mind a little more urgency in-game while side-questing to keep it exciting. Something akin to a timer to get certain main-quest objectives completed before X happens. Would help with the immersion. -Loot - All loot in the game is used for various crafting, and all special gear sets can be upgraded a few times to continue enjoying them as you level up. -You see your decisions through the game intertwine with stories further in! Play this and you will not regret it. The Witcher 3 plays a lot on relationships that have already been established in previous 2 games so I would recommend at least playing Witcher 2 first (A stellar game on its own) as it'll help you with immersion into the world. Thanks.",10,2015-12-04,PC,user

DeusXCom,"I loved previous 2 Witcher games (still considering The Witcher 1 to be one of the best RPG's of all time), to prepare for this 100%, I even read all 8 books, falling in love with Witcher universe even more and now after my 2 months long journey through this I'm finally happy to say that The Witcher 3 didn't disappoint and delivered the goods on basically every level. Transition to open-world went really well and even though there are some minor problems, Wild Hunt is an excellent RPG and a fantastic closure for this epic trilogy. Despite all the internet drama around the visual downgrade, the visuals are absolutely beautiful, probably the best looking open-world game to date and what's even better, it surprisingly runs smoothly even on high details on my older rig. I was worried about optimization, but CDPR did a great job here. Beautiful environments, vast landscapes, but still very detailed, light and weather changes, those sunsets man... Controls and UI has been significantly improved from the terrible consolized Witcher 2, fighting mechanics feel much more fluid and even though it's still not Dark Souls level, it comes very close and it's perfectly fine. I played on hardest Death March difficulty and for the most part the element of challenge was pretty solid throughout the game. The most important thing about RPGs - writing, quests, characters, it's all excellent, even little side-quest activities often provide really interesting stories, there are tons of references to previous games, to books and even to our pop-culture. I caught a glimpse of so many, Fallout, Madonna, David Lynch, Prodigy, Fight Club.. just to name a few. Characters feel really alive, with face expressions and great voice acting, even though many of those faces and voices are repeated quite a lot. As for the mini-games - I was a huge fan of dice poker from previous games, especially TW1 version and I didn't like Gwent as much at first, but once i got around it a bit and gathered good enough cards for my deck, it really started to grow on me and now I consider it to be probably the best mini-game ever in RPG. Now to my problems with this game and why i don't give it a full score (even though it was very close). First, CDPR obviously felt the need to to fill this world with question marks, if every question mark was actually worth visiting, containing interesting quest, or something unique it would be great, but most of these are some random chests filled with junk, monster nests, abandoned sites and so on, where you repeat the same activity all over again countless times. Abandoned sites for example makes you clear the area from monsters/bandits/whatever just to get the 1:1 same result animation every single time, if it was there once or twice, ok, but there are like 50 of those. The same goes for all those marked chests and smuglers caches, I spent entire weekend just sailing the seas around Skellige clearing all those chests and selling all that junk afterwards, not fun at all, I know you can skip these and you can just go for the main quest, but the completionist in me just must do 100% everything the game has to offer and this felt like an artificial way how to prolong the game length, because in the end you spend almost as much time doing all this busy work as you do with regular quests. Quantity not always means quality and quality is always more important. Another gripe was with bugs and glitches, after first starting the game on release day and realizing I can't even finish one of the first quests because of the bug and seeing all those extensive patch notes with each incoming patch, I just had to wait a few months to even start playing to enjoy the game 100%. All this patching and bug fixing should have happened before the release not after. Even now half a year later there are /still quests in my log that cannot be completed, objects often become inactive so the only solution is to restart or reload the game and so on, but all considered, the experience was relatively problem-free. Despite this, I love The Witcher 3, I loved being in this world for so long and I'm kinda sad it's over. Until the DLC arrives... 9/10",9,2015-12-01,PC,user

Centrey,"The Witcher 3 is the final game in the trilogy and CD Projekt Red have truly outdone themselves, finally a sequel that surpasses it predecessors. The main story is intriguing and in depth, with multiple stories crossing over and previous decisions coming back to haunt you. The side quests don't feel like side quests anymore but instead main quests in their own right - they also play a part in how your story will unfold. The graphics, although downgraded, are still excellent and reign superior to most other games of the same genre. But what really makes this game brilliant is the character interaction and development, creating characters you truly care about - or truly hate. There is a fresh blend of humour, romance, macabre and violence, creating a more realistic atmosphere for our hardened witcher. Truly one of the best RPGs to ever be made.",10,2015-11-29,PC,user

Munkey,"At the start I will just say that there is no such thing as a perfect game. Witcher 3 The Wild Hunt is just an amazing RPG. There are some many things amazing in that game for an experienced RPG player but I will write what I found the best and what did I enjoyed the most. First of all the story telling in this game is one of the best I have ever experienced. The main story is very good paced. The Baron quest line is one of the best in RPG games ever. The story is so full of emotions, tough decisions and twists. Every quest has a story and a background and always two or sometimes even more ways to end it. The World of the Witcher is vast and rich with encounters, NPC and more. You got big cities, small villages, forts and ruins to explore. Caves and mountain tops to discover. Yes it has zones it's not one big open world game but one thing in it what is amazing. No loading screens. Enter a cave? A house? A City? A castle? No loading screen! This is how you should do it. Combat is very fluid and you can do it how you want it. Sword fighting, signs (aka magic), potions, traps and bombs. Fast and sneaky or slow and tanky? You can play it how you want it. There is a lot more equipment and upgrades then in previous games. Swords, axes, crossbows and a lot of different armor parts to chose from. You have different armor sets that are tied in to quests and give you some back story to different Witcher schools. Graphic wise Witcher 3 is the best looking game in 2015 period. Yes on PC it requires a powerful machine but on console you still get a medium to high experience. The game just looks beautiful. The character models, the landscape and weather effects. Lightning effects and shadows are amazing. And every zone has its own look and feel to it. All and all a great game and one of the best RPG in gaming history. The best game of this year by a mile. 10 out of 10.",10,2015-11-26,PC,user

Ariate,"As a gamer that have played The Witcher 1 and 2, the expectation to play The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt was a high level. Knowing Cd Projekt RED, I was certain that I would experience a improved witcher game compared with the previous one. I was greatly mistaken. Not only I played an outstanding game, much better than its successors, but I also played one of the best games on my entire life. Despite the graphics controversy, the world of The Witcher 3 is beautiful and astonishing. It's possible to stand hours just looking at the horizon and watch the sun and moon cycles. The people, villages, animals, monsters are all alive. Not just waiting for you to kill them and gain XP. Wolves hunt, people do their daily chores, bandits try to find an easy victim, monster lurk and hunt the countryside. And the music and soundtrack bring a very emotional touch to all that. The story is also one of its greatests achievements. From a simple treasure hunt to a big main quest, the story is never boring, short or **** all very integrated. On a treasure hunt you may discover how a fisher lost a package on a river or how some deserters were prowling and stealing from refugees. The sidequests and monster hunts brings amazing stories about betrayal, love, dark rituals and the war and its effects on common people. The main quest brings a race against time to find someone very important to the Witcher. With many troubles on the way, of course. The gameplay, although not so easy to master and rather clunky (and bug) sometimes, is a very good improvement over the older Witcher games, creating a very strategic, fast and fun combat (specially on the highest difficult). At launch the game had many bug problems but the majority are resolved with the patches released by CD RED. And 16 free DLCs were released, with new gear, quests, skins and a New+ mode. Thereafterr, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a must buy. The beautiful visuals, lovelly music, heartbreaking stories and quests and its fun exploration and gameplay are a mark in the gaming industry. And, definitly, a true and sound ending to the franchise. +Beautiful Visuals +Amazing soundtrack +The best story and sidequests of this generation +Fun Gameplay -Bugs -Clunky Gameplay Veredict: 10/10",10,2015-11-23,PC,user
zzxna,"Let me preface this by saying that TW3 is my first Witcher game. Even though I knew next to nothing about the lore, CD Projekt has done a great job of fleshing out the characters and the history of this troubled land, all of which are tied together by a superbly written story. The main characters of the story are complex and brought to life by well-written dialogue and excellent voice-acting. Denise Gough deserves special commendation for bringing out Yennefer’s condescending and fiery personality. Doug **** signature gruff voice as Geralt is always a pleasure to listen to, though if I had to make one criticism it would be that he needs a little more emotional range. More importantly, TW3 attaches a great deal of importance to the decisions the player makes. And boy, there are LOTS of decisions to make, from deciding whether to spare the life of a criminal left to die by the sea, to deciding who to romance. Sometimes, the consequences of these choices are not obvious, but I always had the sense that what I was doing in the world had repercussions, big or small. Choices made early in the game could potentially have far-reaching consequences 40 hours of playtime later, and it was a joy to carefully consider the various options the game presented to me. TW3 also has one of the best soundtracks a videogame has ever had. I believe this was the first time, after finishing a game, I went to Google the OST in the hopes of downloading it. The various tracks are perfectly suited to whatever is happening at that instant, whether you are exploring the rolling meadows of Ard Skellige or fighting **** of drowners. My only gripe with the game is character progression. Each time you gain a level, you get a skill point to invest in various “traits” that improve your Signs, physical combat or alchemy. I found most of these traits to be uninteresting. While they certainly improved my combative ability, they were simply unexciting numerical bonuses e.g. to attack damage. While some traits unlocked new modes of fighting (e.g. a different way of using your Signs), these were generally unimaginative. A similar criticism can be made of the loot – again, getting better weapons/armour simply means getting weapons that have better numerical stats. Despite this criticism, I am still giving the game a 10 because the story, characters and soundtrack more than make up for its flaws.",10,2015-11-22,PC,user

nikagra,"This is one of the best RPG games I've played in the last few years (I cannot recall any better game to be honest). It is perfect in almost every aspect: interesting story, beautiful, big and convincing world, a lot of really deeply elaborated side quests and characters, great humor... (list goes on and on and on). It took me 230+ hours to finish my first walkthrough. It wasn't the last one for sure. There are a number of things I especially like about this game. As I said, world is beautiful and convincing, even after 200 hours in game, I'm stopping from time to time to listen what people are talking about, to look how little girl plays with a stick like a sword or to admire the scenery. Game pays great attention to details. There is story behind even very small quests. You can read letter or dairy which helps you to know what happen to people. Game also gives you choices and allows you to play with different playstyles. The game is really well optimized on PC. I still remember some AAA that was unplayable for couple of weeks after release.

MenNeedMeat,"I saw this had many positive reviews and I was excited to get this. I saw the videos before its release and was genuinely excited for this game. I put it on my wishlist. Then I saw it on release and realized it got downgraded. Same as how Watchdogs has but people seem to forget it for some reason and forgive The Witcher 3 for it. It's inexcusable and people who allow this to happen are no more than sheep. I bought the game on sale because I could not justify paying full price for this game. Just as I expected, the game was pretty bad. The combat was atrocious and needs to be fixed. It's been about a month and for some reason I cannot make myself sit down and play this game again.

I didn't ever want to find out what happened next when progressing through it. - The combat has an arcade feel to it in the worst possible way.

Danilencol,"The Witcher 3 está entre os suprassumos da indústria dos games, e nem precisaria ser GOT para isso, com o melhor enredo que já vi em um RPG e uma construção de build solida que se não tem um leque de possibilidades como Skyrim, se adapta a preferencia e estilo de gameplay do jogador, você quer ser um tanque a escola do urso é para você, dano é o que importa escola do gato, controlar a batalha a seu favor escola do grifo e etc. Fora os gráficos a imersão tudo parece tão vivo e o futuro de todos está em suas mãos.

kyle20ellis,"When i started on this game for the first time i thought it looked great and everything but i haven't play the first one or the second, later on when i started to read the Books i got a great image of the characters and everything though there is a Netflix show. To be honest it's a good show but not 100% good because there was some things that i didn't get or understand. Later on when i continued on the game it was more fun and exciting, the choices, the story, the characters, the combat, the regions and the enemies it was so fun. I completed the game for like 3 weeks ago and it was totally worth it though it's a long game but it's fun if you like RPG games. There is just one thing that i don't understand it's that People start on this game and upload youtube videos and sooner stops uploading despite how great reviews they have published everywhere. When i found out what the issues was for the most part was they thought the story is too long, they don't get any likes on the gameplay videos, i thought that sounds nonsense and stupid because they have played Skyrim and other games that are long so i don't know what the diffrence is actually. Otherwise if you like RPG and want to play this game you should put Your money on this Most Awesome Experience masterpiece game. 10/10 Great work CD red project I'm looking forward to Heart of Stone and Krew i Wino (Blood and Wine)",10,2022-03-10,XBOX ONE,user

Broyax,"Je me disais à la fin de Witcher 2 : voilà un développeur qui se rapproche dangereusement de Bioware, le studio responsable des mythiques Mass Effect et du fabuleux premier Dragon Age. Et assez ironiquement tandis que CDPR va vers les sommets, Bioware dégringole… Je n’avais pas encore lu les livres mais en deux jeux seulement je m’étais retrouvé happé par ce traitement si dense et sans concession de la fantasy héroïque… Pourtant, l’ambiance générale est contre toute attente moins percutante que dans le second Witcher ; les choix sont souvent obscurs et piégeux ; les dialogues sont fourbes et leurs résultats inattendus, voire illogiques. L’histoire est diluée et simpliste à la fois, rien à voir avec la profondeur et la maturité du Witcher 2, hélas ! Dans Witcher 3, Gégé le sorceleur traque et tue encore plus de monstres… ses sens surdéveloppés lui permettent de remonter la piste des monstruosités qui pullulent, et à cet effet, les mécaniques de la traque sont bien rendues. Chaque monstre exige une approche différente et un manque de préparation ou l’ignorance pure et simple des règles d’engagement mène à un trépas certain ou à de grandes difficultés, car ce gibier là n’est jamais ordinaire. Witcher 3 s’affirme également comme une jolie prouesse graphique et esthétique. Globalement, le jeu tourne plus ou moins bien (ou mal) sur la Xbox au fil des patchs mais le plus important concerne le degré de finition fort satisfaisant : très peu de bugs pour un monde aussi grand et aussi riche. Les combats ont été entièrement retravaillés par rapport à Witcher 2 et offrent désormais une maniabilité en net progrès faite de pirouettes, de contres et d’esquives… mais l’ensemble reste perfectible. A cela s’ajoute le système d’évolution du personnage, assez bien fait tout compte fait. Bretteur hors pair, spécialiste des signes, alchimiste expert (fabrication de bombes comprise), chaque voie permet d’aborder le combat selon son style… Quelques soucis, quelques détails irritent comme tout ce qui concerne la récupération du butin, relative à la position du personnage et non à la caméra ; les temps de chargement quand on meure… (de quoi vous laisser méditer) de pire en pire à chaque patch ; toutes ces icônes en pagaille dans l’onglet « alchimie et artisanat » et dans l’inventaire en règle générale, lequel reste un bordel sans nom. Le monde ouvert en lui-même est certes immense mais pâtit de son immensité. Pour tenter de le remplir, CD Projekt recourt toujours aux mêmes ficelles : des nids de monstres et des chasses aux trésors et aux équipements « légendaires », des camps de bandits… Heureusement, jamais de mission « va chercher, mon toutou à sa mémère » mais tout de même ! ça manque de variété dès qu’on sort de la quête principale et de ses non moins intéressantes quêtes secondaires. A propos de l’histoire décidément simpliste malgré des personnages souvent bien écrits, on s’étonne que les deux fins principales possibles soient aussi pourraves (je n’en vois que deux puisqu’elle reposent forcément sur Ciri et quelques dialogues de loin en loin qui semblaient anodins mais qui se révèlent à votre insu… décisifs, une fois qu’on l’a retrouvée !). Lors de mon premier parcours, j’avais trouvée la première très décevante… Mais que dire de « l’autre » fin dans ce cas ! un incroyable drame dont les justifications sont très discutables et dont les tenants pourtant positifs sont passés sous silence ou escamotés… il en résulte un sentiment de fin bâclée très désagréable. Il en est de même en ce qui concerne le destin de personnages-clés, destins inconnus balayés d’un revers de main par CD Projekt Red. Voilà donc une conclusion très décevante pour un jeu de rôle aussi long, certes pas rédhibitoire vu les qualités par ailleurs mais tout de même. On s’en retrouve dépité et aigri : et la note finale s’en ressent…",6,2022-02-26,XBOX ONE,user

HEAVYD2117,"Great big open world to explore with a good variety of tasks and missions to complete make this quite immersive. However I made the mistake of playing this game AFTER playing assassins creed Valhalla and unfortunately it compares poorly. Geralt is shockingly fragile, a strong gust of wind or slight incline is enough to kill him. No way someone that feeble should make their trade in anything remotely physical. In addition he will frequently forget to draw his sword or even worse put it away mid combat. So combat consists of rolling around frantically trying to avoid direct fighting because he is unable to stand toe to toe with even the weakest enemies, really disappointing after playing a combat monster in Eivor. And just as you think Geralt is the weakest thing in the game you are forced to play as Ciri who is even more useless with a sword. You have to save constantly because you die so easily, there is so much in the game that can just one shot you out of nowhere, the slightest fall a couple of hits from a weak monster and its over. I found myself hating Geralt for his weakness, he dies so easily and often you dont care about him so you dont care about the story, the game is just a constant frustrating struggle to keep him alive. The movement is poor with your horse Roach randomly veering off course and then slamming on the breaks, getting stuck in trees etc. Other massive irritant is the dialogue, prepare to wear out your X button skipping the endless droning on you have to sit through. I guess had a played this in 2015 without any better games it wouldnt seem so poor but im playing it in 2021 and its aged terribly. Get AC Valhalla instead",6,2021-12-21,XBOX ONE,user

Vegito901,"Ok now I got to be honest in this one. At first I felt At the beginning I felt that the game was too overwhelming, too big and too adult for me because I came from Skyrim, and to make a comparison was impossible because they were the ''two greats'' of the genre. I watched an advice video about the game. When I came back I was excited, and when I left White Orchard.... 210 hours are the number of hours I have played. I've played the main campaign 2 times and I'm waiting for the next-gen update to play the DLC's again. The world of The Witcher 3, the Continent, is plagued with evilness, hunger, suffering, sadness and war, that's what you see, and the folklore and richness of the world will make all this stuff charming. Thanks to the huge amount of different and side quests, enemies, how the world reacts to you and your decisions (nothing to do with Skyrim by the way), the beauty of the game itself, the characters, the story, even the gameplay, everything! This game will catch you, and when you finish it you will realize that you played the best game ever. And that if you used your time for something worthwhile. 5000 characters are too few to be able to express all the love and respect I have for this game, all the affection I have acquired for the characters and how I enjoyed the main campaign. But maybe they are enough to talk about the DLC's. Hearts of Stone is fantastic and introduces you to one of the best villains of the saga of video games, I do not want to detail more because although it is worthwhile, what I want to talk more than anything is the second DLC. And even so, it's a sin not to buy the whole game. Blood and Wine... Imagine a place where you gather the most beautiful of French, Italian and Spanish culture. That beautiful music, those colors, that attitude of the inhabitants of Toussaint... after wars and suffering, after death, you arrive in a world full of life, wealth, abundance and nobility. Someone who has a strong European identity would cry from happiness if such a place existed. Toussaint is magnificent, and I repeat it because I measure my words, MAGNIFICENT. A year after playing the DLC I am still humming the songs, I even have them downloaded on my phone and know how to play them on instrument. I already loved The Witcher 3, it was already the best game I'd ever played in my life, and then came Toussaint.... It's a near perfect game. It's magnificent. It's wonderful.

Anatoliy_DeVile,"Экшн от третьего лица с элементами рпг... Ох уж этот рпг, если это не то чем я обычно в фарике сбиваю вертолеты, то никогда не понимал этого скучного трёпа, который по сути выбивает из колеи и значительно понижает уровень адреналина и интереса к происходящему. Так я думал вплоть до прохождения последней полнометражной части Ведьмака. Суть ведь в чем - в том самом исключительном случае, когда сюжет безумно увлекательный, персонажи яркие, харизматичные ну и просто как живые и им действительно сопереживаешь. При таких обстоятельствах система диалогов даёт возможность раскрыть более широко сюжетные хитросплетения и да направить их в то русло, которое ты посчитаешь необходимым, от некоторых принятых решений кардинально меняется история. Так, между прочим, в игре три разных концовки. В моей по хорошей традиции все умерли))) Русская ненормативно-интеллигентная озвучка игры просто блестящая! Тут можно нарыть просто огромную горку всевозможных запоминающихся диалогов и мемов, к примеру, наверняка вы нескоро забудете стишок про Ламберта или крепкие высказывания Золтана, да тут даже второстепенные npc способны ошарашить веселыми монологами. Действие игры происходит в средние века в вымышленном фэнтезийном мире, в котором всё же просматриваются культурное и историческое наследие Польши и Скандинавии. Игровой мир выполнен великолепно и в купе с погодой, которая частенько перерастает в бушующую стихию проникаешься этой мрачной глубокой атмосферой бесповоротно. А какой тут бестиарий!!! И ведь к каждой твари нужно иметь свой подход. Безумно было интересно со всем этим разбираться. Не знаю кому как, но сходу обилие всевозможного инвентаря и примочек Геральта несколько пугает. Конечно, разобравшись во всех этих тонкостях получаешь дополнительное удовольствие от происходящего, но всё же может стоило как-то постепенно вводить в курс дела. Для меня эта часть была первая и мне было не совсем просто, но недолго. Сражаемся в игре двумя мечами - один для людей, второй для магических существ, также в арсенале имеются неординарные ведьмачьи способности и арбалет, которым не особо часто пользовался, разве что для того чтобы сбивать надоедливых сирен и лупить под водой утопцев. Игра достаточно долгая, но в данном случае скорее даже хочется ещё. Это удивительное приключение Геральта из Ривии запомнится мне надолго и да мы точно ее с женой пройдём ещё не один раз. В следующих попытках попробуем затаскивать не всех подряд в постель))) Третий Ведьмак это несомненный шедевр на все времена, для меня лично не имеющий аналогов. Топ из топов!!!

Vini2fs,"the game is a real work of art, the combat is incredible the graphics are great the campaign is gigantic (50 hours of duration of the main campaign and another 50 hours of sidequests) and the scenery is super immersive, games like fallout and red dead redemption use a points system for the good deeds you d, in the witcher this is not what happens you do things that you think are right because you know that that is the right thing to do by creating a much more immersive scenario than you would by simply give points for your good actions.",10,2021-02-08,XBOX ONE,user

DontListen2Me,"Fantastic story, characters, writing and voice acting and all that stuff. The world was pretty great but I would have liked to dive deeper into the ‘politics’ of the world, there was one or two quest lines here that were good but more in this area would have improved the game. Quests were interesting for the most part, played most of the side quests and some of the Witcher contracts, would certainly have played the rest if I enjoyed the combat more. The core combat is pretty fun and fair but certainly not amazing, it’s far better in this respect than games like Skyrim but worse than Dark Souls. Most of the bosses were decently made and unique from one another but I certainly got bored of some basic enemy types by the end e.g drowners and wild hunt hounds. Also many of the other gameplay mechanics weren’t that well done, for example, the crafting system in the game felt almost completely pointless, why would I go through the effort to find all the stuff necessary then go to a blacksmith and pay to get a sword when in a few hours time I’ll just find a higher level sword anyway. I rarely made use of other mechanics like the runestones or alchemy because they also felt pointless.

propulsion,"This is an excellent game. I knew nothing about the Witcher going into the game. I admit that was a little bit off putting at first, especially since they put you in a small area as sort of a tutorial in the beginning of the game that’s starts off a little slow. Once the game opened up after that I got hooked. It motivated me to watch the Netflix show, and I even went and read the 8 books. Some of the books were really good. That background definitely makes the game better, but isn’t necessary. This is one of those games with a huge scope. The main story is estimated to take you around 50 hours. In some ways it reminds me of my Skyrim play through where I ignored the main quest for a long time and just did my own thing and side content. If you do that there are well over 100 hours of stuff to do. The combat is pretty interesting, mixing sword play with a little magic. There are different ways to build your character to fit your fighting style. I am about to start the DLCs, which are part of the complete edition or can be bought stand alone. They are highly rated and one of them even increases your ability to make custom character builds for combat. This is a top notch role playing game in an authentic open world. If you’re on the fence, check out a video review or take the plunge like I did and pick it up on sale. A free update for next gen consoles has been promised.

BlueBlazer881,"This game is amazing but has a pretty steep learning curve. While the narrative is fantastic, gameplay takes a while to get used to but is part of the joy. Yes combat can feel clunky and frustrating at some times but part of the joy of this game is not only learning the nuances of the combat but also how to defeat enemies in the most efficient way. Rather than just relying on a skill bar to determine how strong you are, this game encourages you to dive into the lore to conduct yourself in the best way possible. For gamers that can allow themselves to lean into this and accept the challenge of the learning curve are met with one of the most rewarding experiences in gaming. Aside from this learning curve this game offers intense immersion, great character development & story, great customization and level up system, and compelling lore. After playing the game throughout it is clear why many consider it ""game of the decade.""",0,2020-09-03,XBOX ONE,user

Refreshment,"The Witcher 3 is been one of the most satisfying experiences we could have seen in this generation of consoles. What's more, It is one of the best and complete videogames of history. Despite It's not a perfect game, no doubt that It has everything that makes a game a great one. The story that is told plays a really important part as in any other The Witcher. It's really deep and full of details we better not miss, because they could be important in the future. In addition, the characters are very worked out and each of them have its own personality, what makes you feel attached to them and interested in the plot. What's more, we are responsible of how the script unfolds in many situations thanks to the decisions we can take in the dialogues. Our choices will be important, what makes you feel participant of the story. Despite the importance of the plot, it's well balanced with the gameplay, which mixes perfectly elements from RPGs, adventure and action games. Along the game we'll be able to explore certain parts of the map depending on our skills in combat, our level and our progress in the game. That makes The Witcher to be challenging and gripping, because we'll be always looking forwards to see what happen next in the story and what is going to be like the next area. However, what is most impressing of this game is the overwhelming amount of content It has. There's a good number of main mission and a bigger one of secondary missions and contracts. We can also find a great variety of creatures that will never stop impressing us and different potions that will help us defeating them, the monster hunting experience is by far one of the most amazing thing of this game... Even though it has many. The equipment plays an important role in the game, ovbiously if we want to face some enemies or other challenges we'll have to wear a good armour and carry strong blades with us; to get them it'll be neccesary visiting certain points of the map, finishing missions, meeting blacksmiths and many other things. As I mentioned before, unfortunatetly there isn't a perfect game yet. And The Witcher 3 is not an exception... Despite the graphics look great, it's obvious the downgrade that it suffered and is something the gamers should not tolerate. It is dishonest promising something that developers can't make happen. Another thing that is annoying is everything related with horses in this game. They haven't work on them as hard as in the rest of the game for sure... And it is a pity due to its potential, it could have been great. To make a brief summary of this issue, they are uncomfortable to ride and the races and everything about them are really simple. Thanks to The Witcher 3, We'll have hundreds of intense hours that we'll spend stuck to our gamepad.",9,2020-06-12,XBOX ONE,user

Luxorum,"It just awesome experience. No words! I want to be an objective, so that's my ratings: Graphics: 7/10 - very nice face effects, and looking at all, but bad 2000's and triangle graphics a lot of time, and escpecially in cutscenes we have some visual disappointments(remember Ciri eating ""nothing"" by hands(!) in scene with baron). But overall quality is pretty well. Storyline: 10/10 - we have some little plot holes, but it's excellent experience, just had a lot of fun. A long, strong story with a lot of emotions. Gameplay: 9.5/10 - we have a lot of interesting and emotional tasks, just very fun to deal with, and of course - Roach, I love horse mechanics, and this one is especially good. Combat system: 9/10 - bunch of weapons, elixirs, different additional weapons, it's very well developed. World fill: 10/10. Large map, full of different locations and interesting places, each with it's own atmosphere, never get tired to explore them all. DLC: 10/10: Two marvellous dlc's each one has ""game"" size, interesting stories, and a lot of new mechanics and gameplay features. Especially having own house. So, it's strong 9 average, but with adding my own warm experience, it's a pity that metacritic don't allow you to put the digits it will be 10. I love this game too much.",10,2020-04-26,XBOX ONE,user
dmoran6,"The best game I have every played. I've long been a fan of the RPG genre, but The Witcher 3 stands apart. Unlike most other games, you cannot jump in and hope to slash your enemies to death. The Witcher 3 draws you in and makes you think like the Witcher Geralt - how do you best prepare for a fight. Read the lore, apply oils, prepare your signs. Each monster requires almost a unique approach, and even once you are familiar with the way to deal with a monster type, the combat is slow enough that you can appreciate the interaction. I would recommend this game to everyone - and the DLC Blood and Wine is among the most beautiful scenery I have ever seen, including real life.",10,2020-04-24,XBOX ONE,user

CoolDadTx,"Caveat: This is the original version and not GoTY. I own both but as everyone knows the GoTY version won't unlock any achievements. It is completely broken so I played through the original version instead. Gamewise this is identical to the PC version so it has all the strengths of the PC game. Not being moddable though means I had to play it like the devs intended and there were certainly some frustrating parts. Fortunately the devs had resolved some of the more controversial issues in the PC version ahead of time (like all ingredients having weight) but there were still some things I missed. Focusing just on the XBox-specific stuff though there are some downsides to this version. 1. After extended sessions you could suddenly not dive anymore. While the options were shown attempting to dive did nothing. This was most common if you were swimming a lot and mixing in combat such that you might enter/exit combat mode sporadically like going around Skellige. The only workaround was to restart the game. You could also get near some drowners and have them pull you under and things reset as well. Still being out in the middle of the water just to realize you cannot dive wasn't great. 2. Crashed after extended play sessions, frequently. 3. Sometimes if you were drawing a weapon at just the right time some interaction was occurring then the game would act like you had a weapon in hand when you hit something but you could still see the swords on your back and your hands were empty. Had to ""sheathe"" and ""unsheathe"" to reset. 4. A plus was that horse stamina didn't seem to work in this version. So in all the races you could run indefinitely which made them infinitely easier than the original. 5. On the negative side horse races were very buggy. In some cases you could leave the path and you'd get a warning to get back on. In other case you'd be following the path and it would immediately fail the race saying you left the path. In some cases you had to figure out where the ""path"" was so the game wouldn't auto-fail. Unrelated you could be galloping along at full speed and suddenly you'd just stop for no reason. It's almost like you hit something but nothing was there. You could immediately start galloping again but by that point the other racer(s) have already passed you. I failed a couple of races just because of this. 6. Locking on enemies in combat was iffy. For most enemies it worked out OK but any enemy that could disappear and reappear you'd lose the lock. On the PC this isn't a big deal as you can recover quickly but on XBox where spinning the camera around takes a while you often get hit before you get a chance to do anything. 7. Some achievements wouldn't unlock after a lengthy play session. You had to restart the game and load a save prior to unlocking it. 8. Why is there only 10 or so save slots? 9. In several instances you'd get a loading screen between areas and it would just sit there forever. The only workaround was to restart. Overall I enjoyed this game as much as I did on PC but given the amount of time it takes to beat it I'm really glad it is over and I'm not playing it again. Classic game but only playable once. Overall I found the XBox version to be easier than the PC version. I played on the second highest difficulty and found the combat to be way easier than on PC.",7,2020-04-01,XBOX ONE,user

Combat is a little button mashy but in no way detracts from the excellent story or game play.,10,2020-02-05,XBOX ONE,user

TrevorS98,"An absolute masterpiece in open world gaming and story telling in general. This is a must play game for any open world RPG fans, and this game is an RPG in the truest sense. You really feel like Geralt as you play. Definitely the most immersive fantasy RPG I've ever played.",10,2020-02-03,XBOX ONE,user
TheWaffle,"I wish I could love this as much as everyone else. I enjoy the detective elements and the world building is great. But this is a far cry from excellent RPGs like KOTOR, Mass Effect, and Skyrim. The combat is a mess, with enemies bumping around and lunging awkwardly at you. Mashing the attack button as fast as possible seems to be the key to victory in almost every fight. The open world really just disguises a very linear adventure. Walk into a tavern, someone says something snarky, the innkeep gives Geralt the information he needs, repeat. And, your conversation options are extremely limited, which makes it hard to keep up the role-play experience. There are also some quirks that ruin the illusion: it's rather weird to see zombie monsters walking around the beach only a stone's throw from a village. Alchemy is good in concept, but it's a lot of time spent researching and collecting herbs just to get a minor bonus. The graphics and glitches are inexcusable in this 2015 release (four years after Skyrim, three years after ME3). Walk into a room and you're likely to see two npcs talking, while a third one stands intersected with one of them. At one point I was talking with Vesemir and my horse was bouncing up and down on a fence post out the window. The control scheme completely breaks down in any enclosed areas, with Geralt crashing all over any room or cave that he enters. And it's hard to take a crime scene seriously when you can't get him to focus on the 1 mm spot where there's a highlighted clue.",6,2020-02-02,XBOX ONE,user

InfamousRJD,"After completing this on the PC I wanted to try the Xbox One X enhanced version of this game and experience it in 4K with HDR. You get two graphics options, one with dynamic resolution scaling that tries to stick to 60fps or true 4K mode, which runs at 30fps. I choose the 4K mode, and after a few minutes the slower frame rate stops being noticeable and you can explore Velen, Novigrad and Skellige in stunning 4K. This game is simply glorious - in fact it has set a bar so high that very few games since have been able to hold my attention. The story is fantastic, the characters are very grounded and you feel as though you are just one person in a world that could happily carry on without you. Not to mention the music, which is the best I've ever heard in a video game. Overall CDPR have created a masterpiece.",10,2019-11-16,XBOX ONE,user

Vation,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a masterpiece. The world is beautiful, varied and full of interesting places and characters. The writing is absolutely superb. Both the main story as well as all the side missions. Therefore, even in rather insignificant side missions or monster contracts, the sense that these missions were all still handcrafted from the bottom up and not just ""copy-pasted"" is ever so noticeable throughout a very lengthy journey in this world. Which is unlike most open world games these days, that is, games that use the exact same formula and lazy structure for each side mission simply to bolster that sense of ""many things to do"". Now there were so many things to do in The Witcher 3 as well, but unlike most open world games, it wasn't quantity > quality it was both quantity and quality. And so The Witcher 3's lack of repetition and it's incredible creativity in what ever you happen to do speaks volumes about CDPR. Because you can really tell they made this game with passion. Speaking of CDPR, the fact that this relatively small studio managed to create this game, that is (in my opinion) the best game ever created alongside Red Dead Redemption 2 is nothing short of amazing. What The Witcher 3 does so incredibly well (amongst so many other things) is the atmosphere. The Fields of White Orchard, the forests of Velen, the streets of Novigrad to the harsh cold of the Skellige islands. All these places have a unique feeling to them. As mentioned it is absolutely huge and took me forever to complete. And the fact that it takes you across multiple regions and over countless hours of an incredible story to complete, its a journey unlike any other. Thus, the world, Geralt of Rivia and the characters you meet will stay with you for a very long time. Absolutely amazing, gaming at its best.",10,2019-10-03,XBOX ONE,user

La historia es muy buena, los personajes entrañables, la duración es muy buena, el juego es bastante largo largo, y si quieres completarlo al 100%, prepárate para echarle horas, Simplemente un juego esencial para todo jugador que se aprecie, que no solo se va a disfrutar como un enano, sino que lo vas a recordar durante toda tu vida.",10,2019-09-21,XBOX ONE,user
DAmnfool,"Well, I used to be a skeptic. I own PC version of this game for several years. I tried a few times to play, but stopped every time after no more than 15 minutes. I found the game to be annoying, because i felt that I needed to learn many things at once - e.g. combat seemed complicated, strange camera works, etc. And only just recently I got Xbox one x 4k enhanced edition. A decided to give it a try... and I was blown away. First of all, the Witcher in 4k on 75'' TV looks stunning. To such extent, that when I play, my wife and my kind sit by my side to watch me playing (I need to wear headphones though 'cause NPCs swear alot). Yes, on a big screen this game is ultra-beautiful, player can really really immerse him/her-self in the game's world. Second thing - gamepad is way better for this game than keyboard. I'm a gamer for over 20 years now, and most of my life I played PC games using keyboard + mouse. No pads, never. This is the first time I must admit, that Xbox's pad may be better suited for this purpose. I'm not sure for typical FPS games, here mouse may be still more precise. But controlling the Witcher with gamepad seems so much easier, especially in combat, when you have all options (dodge, jump, fast attack, heavy attack etc) just where you need them. It applies to horse riding to - easy and convenient. I'm not going to comment on the story - I don't feel **** by it, but its OK. For me that's secondary. But those 2 aspects - gorgeous graphics and great mechanics changed my opinion on this game, and also the rating - from 4 on PC to 10 with xbox one. I'm not going to play this game on PC ever again, that's for sure.",10,2019-09-18,XBOX ONE,user

Odh,"Never even heard of the witcher before this game, had absolutely no interest in playing it, but all the hype and great reviews, I gave it a chance. I am so thoroughly impressed with this game, I might go as far to call it the best game of this decade, perhaps any decade? I mean for me, my 3 favorites of this decade are Breath of the Wild, Xenoblade Chronicles 1, and Witcher 3. Not sure what order, but I will say, witcher 3 has the best sidequests I have ever seen in any game ever made. Sidequests are like full length storylines themselves! The areas explored White orchard, Velen, and Ard Skellige are incredible environments. The lore is every bit as good as Lord of the rings, game of thrones, or Star wars. The cutscenes are brilliant, the music is really good, the gameplay is not overly complicated but fun, and the DLC is the best I have ever seen any game get. One of the few games where DLC is done right and not a cash grab rippoff. I mean the Hearts of stone and blood and Wine packs could have been witcher 4, but they treated us to a masterpiece **** that is difficult for any game to match. A masterpiece. .",10,2019-09-06,XBOX ONE,user
Gman117,"NOT PERFECT BUT STILL GREAT My first play through of Witcher 3 was 80 hours of main quest, side quest and Witcher contracts. A very good experience however I believe it loses it's direction at a certain point in the game. As a huge fan of Witcher 2, the third installment does the series justice but does not add anything revolutionary and feels like it is playing it safe at times. I was satisfied with how they intertwined the characters from 1 and 2 (Triss, Vernon Roche, Vesemir, Zoltan, etc...) The open world is fantastic, detailed, and filled with plenty of creatures to kill. The citizens are lively, and convincing, and the mythology imbued is at times creepy and intriguing. After a while of playing the game, you realize that there is not much variety in the monsters fighting. They're are a good amount of different species that is not the problem. The problem is many of them are very predictable in fighting styles and can be as simple as attack, attack, dodge, attack. It is easy to predict movement and to parry or dodge. It doesn't;t feel like you are truly mastering over any creature or specializing any specific combos of swordplay, spells and potions. It's not very intuitive and feels dumbed down. The Witcher 2 had better combat in terms of this, it was challenging, and required you to prepare before the fight not during the fight. The ai was much more unforgiving than in the third. I believe this was simplified because it was to be more mainstreamed to broader audiences which is fine by me. I believe more people should be allowed to enjoy the deep lore and story the Witcher universe has to offer. I played this game on the third highest difficulty and plan to replay on new game + on Death March with different choices. However even on the third difficulty the game just wasn't;t that challenging at all like in Witcher 2. So I can imagine it won't be that much of a stretch on Death March difficulty. One of the curves that the Witcher has fixed at least is that it delivers a good story for an open world game especially for today. The first 50 hours are fantastic (Except for Novigrad which is pretty lame and is consisted of mostly running around quest). The story has rhythm in these first hours, the exploration is thrilling and self-rewarding. The repetition and formula of the game that is at it's weakest is the constant investigation tack ons. Press LT to use your Witcher senses... This will be like a constant nag, much like Navi the Fairy annoying without the ""HEY"" but still quite tedious. For me personally this game tried to hard at the story at one point. Also I understand that Siri is a main character in the books and plays an integral part but I think she **** in this game. Every time she's in a cutscene or every time you have to play as her, you just want to get it over with so you can go back to Geralt's flow. In Witcher 1 and 2 Ciri was not visually seen only mentioned by a npc here and there with subtlety. So when you go right to Witcher 3, your reaction is, who dis? Well more like she doesn't fit in, and the same goes for Yennifer, who was hyped up since the first game and the final reveal was pretty lame. She's **** degrades Geralt sometimes and talks down to him like he's nothing, and treats everyone like **** and your telling me I have to like her because??? I had Geralt stick with Triss, they did more together in the video game trilogy that you the player visualized than what he and Yennifer did the entire third game. The worst part for me was what the game is actually titled. THE WILD HUNT... This was the lamest villain I have ever seen in an RPG to date! They terrorize the people back and forth looking for Ciri, bringing frozen blizzard like magic around them freezing their victims to death. SPOILER SPOILER These Lord of the Ring like villains who pretend dress as wanna-be Saurons, are just fancy elves from another dimension... Yeah, thats it! No explanation to why their voices change when they wear the mask, why they bring frost with them even though they come from a world that looks the same as our world. Absolutely stupid and more proof that this game at one point just did anything and figured everyone will love it. This was horrible and when compared to the Witcher 2 is an embarrassment. The Witcher 2 was so great because you could really play up the Witcher neutrality and literally not fight the last boss. You could just be like ""Hey um, I get your side of the story Letho so you know what. I don't think fighting is gonna solve anything so let's just go our own way."" Sure enough it works! And at the time that was awesome and truly gave that feeling of this is more than a fantasy game. The Witcher 3 falls into this trap sadly, after 45-50 hours, it turns into a generic fantasy game. I can tell you exactly where it falls short in the main quest and that is after the fight at Kaer Morhen when you gather your allies to fight the Wild Hunt.",7,2019-09-02,XBOX ONE,user
Rohrteppich95,One of the greatest games of all time. The story is breathtaking and in addition side quests are good as well.

It all feels just so natural, without getting dull. The overall story amazes me every time I play it. Even the DLC quests (Heart of Stone in particular) are just amazingly made.

I have never in my life showed real emotion in a games storyline like I have with W3. Choices have consequence, imagine saving a puppy from a near accident, nursing him to health and then releasing him outside and having it be hit by a car secdonds later. Why the F did you not just leave the puppy inside the house.... Yep that’s this game. It may not be until 30 hours later that it gets you, but know this. It will get you. Somehow, someway. This game reaches in a pulls your heart or conscience out at least once to the point, that months after you’ve stopped playing it, every time someone brings it up, you will talk about it. Combat is a curve but an awesome one at that. Once it’s mastered you feel linked with Geralt, and the two of you are unstoppable.

CDPR managed to create a world that completely engulfs you in its incredibly detailed hillsides, mountains, villages, towns and general scenery. The story that you follow is phenomenal and will have you dying to get to the bottom of Geralt's troubles. The DLC is equally good and introduces a number of new characters, weapons, and even game mechanics. You're met with sophisticated dialogues, world choices, and a perfectly dark lore throughout side quests that truly accompany the plot. The combat and gameplay is smooth, responsive, and rewarding.

Cazanator,"What I am about to say will be some what of a cliche, but The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is the greatest game I have ever played. I have played and finished this game in 2018, so it is a long while after the game was actually released. I in fact tried once, maybe twice (can't remember) to get into this game but I couldn't. But ever since watching videos of various games, what felt like Deja Vu, suddenly became repetitive. And that was numerous people saying that The Witcher 3 is the best game they have ever played. I for one was more than skeptical about these statements, because I had always thought that The Last of Us was the finest game I would ever play. But this game has moments that I have not experienced in any game I have ever played. I cared for character in series in which I had not played the previous two. Each and every single quest has a depth to it that I cannot comprehend. You can find out about how the mechanics of the game works through videos, what I have tried to base my review on is simply how this game has made me feel. I had lost my love for gaming. For years I would spend an average of two hours, every week (rookie numbers) playing games. Whether you think it is a good or a bad thing, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has reinvigorated my love for gaming. Just play the game, it is hard to get into at first I admit. But whether its the first 5, 10, 15 or even 20 hours, there WILL be a moment in which this game will click for you and you will say to yourself ''I am playing the finest game of this generation''. 10/10.",10,2018-03-22,XBOX ONE,user
Erendar,"A little late review but after investing 450 hours into this game I can safely say this is the best game I have played in these 20 years I've been into gaming. Also both of the expansions deserve a solid 10/10. PROS: - Characters. There are a lot of them and they all feel unique, deep and realistic. - Storytelling. The story itself and how it is told is unrivalled. Also the choices you make will have long term consequences and they shape the story. Nothing in this game is black and white and that's the beauty of the story. - Graphics are really beautiful. I found myself just walking around watching the beautiful sceneries surprisingly often. - Music is great and suits the game. - Sidequests. There's a whopping amount of them and they all feel unique interesting short stories. - World is huge and filled with a ton of details. - Combat. I've seen some complaints about it but I have always enjoyed it. It's swift and elegant swordplay combined with casting spell-like signs. - Gwent. A collectible card game included in the game. ""A game in a game so you can play when you play"". - Geralt of Rivia. CONS: - Sometimes minor difficulties in moving in narrow or thight spaces - It ends.",10,2018-02-27,XBOX ONE,user

WeenyDrake,"I was a little late to The Witcher 3 party, but I'm glad I made the time to play through this game in its entirety. I played through as many of the side quests, treasure hunts, and witcher contracts as I could, and never for a second did the game feel repetitive or boring. Every side quest felt unique, every map was beautiful and riddled with secrets, and every battle felt satisfying. The combat felt fluid, weighted, and complex (but ever excessively so). If you haven't played the first two games, it can take a while to catch on to what's going on in the world, but it's still very accessible as a standalone.",10,2018-01-26,XBOX ONE,user
AngryShark92,"I rarely ever give praise to a game in this modern era, let alone a 10/10 rating (95 rounded up), but this game is truly a masterpiece. I was always an open world RPG fan, and did not end up playing this game until a year after its release due to a persistent friend who annoyingly bugged me to try it. I had always been a Bethesda fan and so Elder Scrolls & Fallout always had priority for me. I finally gave in and tried the game out. I do not even know how to express how blown away I was by this game, it is actually hard to put into words without sounding like a glorified fanboy, but this game is just a masterpiece. I had no idea what happened in the previous entries, all I had was a prologue video with a bit of explanation on where I am when I start the game and what my objective was. Surprisingly, that is all it took to launch me into hours upon hours of gameplay to explore and interpret the lore of The Witcher universe on my own. This game is not perfect, but it is definitely one of the closest to that 100 score. It has a great narrative, enticing gameplay, loads of content to sink your teeth in, interesting characters with some of the best voice acting I've heard in a video game, and it keeps you coming back with the ability to try out different builds and continue your progression with the New Game+ feature. Not to mention some absolutely awesome DLC content that are well worth the extra cost. I will also mention the few dislikes I have with this game are that there is no jumping vertically in combat, some of the characters faces are identical or close to it (mostly villagers and city citizens), and of course a few bugs here and there that always exist in large open world RPGs that CDPR has made efforts to fixing. Oh, and Roach, sorry girl but you're really weirdly behaved in game. The List: Pros: - Amazing story and universe lore - One of the best game universes ever created, the settings in this game and the locations are the best I have ever seen, specifically Skellige & Toussaint, which were above and beyond IMO - Great and interesting characters with incredibly good voice acting talent - Excellent RPG levelling and character building elements - Loads of content outside of main story, including side quests, loot searches, treasure hunts for interesting Witcher gear that are based on your play style - Well designed monsters that are an absolute blast to tangle with, and a bestiary packed with information about these creatures that really makes them believable for the story - Some of the best side quests I have ever seen in an RPG game, really close to my love of the fallout side quests (3 & NV) - Excellent GWENT card game integration which I believe was an absolute blast to play in game and served as a nice break from grinding and battling - Two brilliantly executed DLC packs that are well worth the money, Blood and Wine is the better of the two, but Heart of Stone had a great story as well - Blood and Wine's Toussaint region is absolutely brilliant and beautiful - Blood and Wine's vampire lore is actually very interesting and it is fun to explore - Death March difficulty is tough, but fair Cons: - No vertical jump during combat hinders escapability and often gets Geralt stuck on small objects - A few recycled faces throughout the world's citizens - Roach's behaviour is awkward and cumbersome Those cons do not even come close to hindering the true masterpiece this game is, all I can really say is that you have to try it out yourself, if you have not already. Seeing as this game came out almost 3 years ago, most people probably already have, but I had to put this review on here because it really is a showcase of what video games have the potential to be... an artistic masterpiece. Nothing else to say, it is one of my Top 3 games of all time.",10,2018-01-15,XBOX ONE,user

The story is good and is around 40+ hours long and has several different paths you can take. The voice acting is good and suits the characters they are playing. The main character Geralt is complex and deep and has an interesting story.

James84,"This game is nearly perfect. The story is deep and fascinating, with an almost endless supply of unique characters. All quests are fully voice acted, and not given to you as a wall of text like some RPGs. The combat is fun and easy to get used to. The crafting system seems daunting in the beginning but after a few hours you start to understand how things work. The only negative I would give this game is that it feels very clunky at times, particularly the movement of Geralt and his horse. Moving the horse in tight spaces can be frustrating but the pros in the game far outweigh any cons.",10,2017-11-21,XBOX ONE,user

Даже если задание сводится к ""Принеси мне это"" или ""Убей или спаси кого-то"" то это преподносится с интересной историей +Сюжет хоть и простой , но в нём можно встретить разных интересных персонажей , и из-за них и хочется дальше проходить сюжет +Очень хорошая и проработанная RPG +Есть 2 dlc которые оправдывают свою стоимость . Они добавляют новых интересных персонажей , интересную историю где твой выбор много значит . ""Крови и вино"" вообще прекрасное дополнение , которое добавляет новую огромную очень красивую локацию , и новые интересные побочные и сюжетные квесты . Ещё появилось много разных монстров +Огромное количество снаряжения +Твой выбор почти всегда на что-то влияет +Интересный , захватывающий , геймплей +Карточная игра ""Гвинт"" очень интересная игра Фух...

(Мне например сильно мешал баг в Гвинт'е , я очень долго не мог победить в Гвинт'е одного персонажа , после 20-30 мин. игры я выигрывал но игра перестала отвечать на нажатия мыши , и так не только у меня) -Техника боёвки многим не нравится , и люди из-за этого бросают игру (лично мне понравилось) -РУССКАЯ озвучка часто багает -Не каноничный Геральт , и вообще много несовпадений с книгой -NPC часто тупять , например когда ты идёшь , прыгаешь с лестницы , получаешь немного урона , и весь город в страхе , нет , в УЖАСЕ убегает от тебя , и очень сильно орут Стоит упомянуть очень незначительные минусы: 1. Нет мультиплеера или кооператива , ""CD Projekt red"" заявила что ""The witcher 3 wild hunt"" это последняя часть серии , ну в последнею часть серии всё таки стоило добавить хотя бы подобие кооператива 2.У многих ПК не могут потянут эту игру (У меня после 15-50 часов в игре , сгорела видеокарта за 17000-20000 тысяч рублей , и пришлось покупать новую : (",10,2017-11-08,XBOX ONE,user

Saman_Tepes,"This is the best RPG that I've played Since Zelda Ocarina of Time. Tons of Depth and an enjoyable story. The game has 4 open world maps filled with real content and not fetch quests.Having played the Witcher 2 I didn't need much convincing to pre-order the game with the season pass. CDProject Red has really improved their story telling here. Those that are new to the series won't need to play Witcher 2 to understand what's happening but you'll get a little more out of your play through if you at least know the synopsis for the two previous games and or if you've maybe read the books and are somewhat familiar with the World of The Witcher. Pros --Great Combat, fun and challenging. this game is filled with a huge variety of monsters/enemies that can take you out quickly if your not paying **** won't be able to button mash your way through it(unless your on the easy difficulty). --Massive,Immersive Maps lots to see and do, you'll explore several unique locations. --This game has some of the best side quests of any RPG. They are all very enjoyable. --Good Character progression, a far more challenging experience then your run of the mill RPG's. The game kept me on my toes through my entire play-through but didn't force me to spend several hours grinding in-between missions to keep up either. --The great Voice acting,Theme music/Score really help bring the Witcher 3 Story to life. --Interesting well thought out characters with creative backstories all with their own unique faces,body shapes,weight and height. I'm tired of the Mannequin NPC's in every single game, It really takes away from the immersion when everyone looks exactly the same but with a different coloured outfit or different amount of facial hair. --None of that ""To be Continued"" nonsense. The Witcher series was a deep evolving story with a proper ending(multiple unique endings in fact) and not some annual cash grab like most other franchises have ****'s nice to see a Developer take a break from one beloved franchise and work on something new and different. I'm more excited about the future release of CyberPunk 2077 then I would be for The Witcher 4. --The inclusion of free DLC was a nice touch. You get a handful of new side quests,weapons,armors and Cards. they could have easily charged another $10-20 on pre-orders for this content or locked it behind the Season Pass but they didn't. You won't find find any Horse armor DLC here but you can get some for free in Toussaint when you Play the Blood and Wine expansion. Cons -Annoying User Interface before the 1.05 update -some minor bugs/glitches mostly in the later parts of the game which got a bit worse with 1.03 update but still nothing game breaking. Did my first 50+ full main quest play-through without crashing once and only noticed a handful of minor bugs.I only crashed a couple times on my second play-through after the 1.05-1.07 updates but most bugs have been ironed out with the last few Updates plus they further improved the UI/invetory management and added a ton of other goodies. --It's very hard for anyone to complain about a game with this level of Post-Launch Support. I can't remember any other developer in recent history doing weekly to bi-weekly to monthly updates for any single player game, in fact they put out 20 in just over a year. That's like 15-19 more then big name Developers like Bathesda,Bioware,Ubisoft will do for an entire life cycle for their games and they'll also take their sweet time doing it cause they need the man power for that awesome Horse Armor DLC and since when is it a requirement for NPC's to have faces in games, Some bits of hair, two creepy floating eyes,nose and lips with below average acting/story/gameplay will get you 8-10 out 10 on IGN or Gamespot every time so why bother. --The Witcher 3 although not perfect is still a 10/10 game and worthy of the 300+ Awards they've received.I'm glad they're working on a new game and not trying to push out a half-done cookie cutter style sequel every year like everyone else.",10,2017-02-19,XBOX ONE,user

Jrodg6950,"Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt Game Review Open world games are the labeled by some as the best in the market, they include hours upon hours of game time and several hours of side quests and expansions. The Witcher 3 does not break that chain, it comes with about 47 hours of main story time, 99 and a half hours with the side quest, with a total of 164 hours if you attempt to find everything the world has to offer. It is the third game in its series of games written based off a series of fantasy books from 1992. Which in you follow around Geralt of Rivia a Witcher or monster slayer who goes around the world slaying monsters with bounties on them. A competitor in the world of open world games is Fallout 4. A game in which you are a survivor of nuclear fallout and have to explore your world to attempt and fix the world around you. Its main storyline is 24 and a half hours, 75 and a half with side quests, and 145 if you try to find everything in the nuclear wasteland. The games are both highly rated with the Witcher winning game of the year in 2015. The Witcher has more playtime and an well made combat system, but has a lot of glitches around the world the developers couldn’t find. While Fallout 4 has a more expansive arsenal and more personalized character with mods to go along with it. In the end because of its expansive world and vast story line along with the combat system, I give the Witcher a 9/10.",9,2016-12-14,XBOX ONE,user

EdLovesGames,"Simply the best fantasy, action RPG of all time. Witcher 3's gameplay and deep mechanics set in the most vast yet detailed world ever digitally created, is at it's worst moments still downright amazing. Even the mini card game, gwent is so much fun that it is getting its on separate console version. The characters and story are what hold this large and lengthy game together. In a time where many action RPG's rely mostly on fetch quests to fill the game, the witcher 3 uses its amazing world, deep dialog, and variety of enemies to keep the game feeling fresh 10s of hours in. Battling multiple, high leveled enemies is very dynamic and challenging however even with the Witcher's deep mechanics, the game's intuitive design allows for players to fight the way they want while allowing a lot of room for growth and mastery. Whether you want to be a heavily armored swordsman or an agile powerful mage, every attribute allows for players to become stronger, but does not group you into a class. Even in such a large playable space, I never found myself bored. The detailed world, filled with enemies and secrets, builds on the rich story and provides its own way of teaching you the history of the land. Never have I felt as compelled to tell as many people about a game as I do with the witcher 3. It is a game that bridges the gap between action, fantasy, RPG, and deep narrative. If you have an interest in any of these genres then this is a must play. CD Projekt Red is, if not the best, certainly in the top 3 developers in the world. 10/10",10,2016-10-11,XBOX ONE,user
RichardGreen,"These reviews are surprising. This game is nowhere near as good as Mass Effect or Middle Earth: SOW. The controls are awkward, combat on the horse doesn't work (Assassins creed did it better), the best battle is just fighting a gryphon which is won with simple dodges, some quests are way too hard for your level so pacing is off, creating items and armor has been made overly complicated - need so many items to craft simple items. WoW did crafting so well. I really don't get the hype, yeah voice acting is amazing but that's about it. I got the game at $30 and still wasn't amused.

vizzle311,"I know it's not a popular opinion among RPG fans but I just couldn't buy fully into Witcher 3. While I recognize the INCREDIBLE technical achievement that the game is, my reason is very subjective. I was let down mainly by the lack of customization with the main character and couldn't really immerse myself in the universe/lore. I'm a gamer who wants a total blank slate with my main character and full control of gear. It's really hard to get into a game for 100+ hours when you just don't find the character interesting. It was very bothersome to be pigeon holed into Geralt and only allowed to outfit him with 2 sword types and armor, that's it. Again, I recognize how impressive the amount of gear is in the game but it's still within this restrictive context. The reason I've played Fallout for over 200 hours is the total customization of your avatar/character. Also, similar to my experience with the Elder Scrolls games, I just didn't find the universe to be as immersive as others. If you don't see the appeal in the source material that influenced the Witcher, then you aren't as into it no matter how good the gameplay is. That being said, the gameplay design overall is a cut above and I did enjoy it for 10-12 hours. Ultimately, a game like this requires a true investment of time and I just couldn't get over the hump to that next level for the reasons listed above. Still a game that should be commended for being a true piece of art and work of passion in a hobby that too often just releases straight up **** to make money.",7,2016-07-28,XBOX ONE,user
Velgar,"Absolutely amazing game! I have played thousands of different titles in my life, countless RPGs and other story driven games, but the Wither 3 is by far the best of them all. Simply stunning. Hands down my favourite RPG game. Visuals and audio are top notch, you just can't get enough of watching game's picturesque landscapes, cities, villages, caves and forests. You often just slow down and listen to people chatting, nature humming and music casting its spell. Combat is fast paced, tactical, challenging and satisfying, yet it could be even more challenging for my personal preference (like in Dark Souls 3) because even on the hardest possible difficulty I fare quite well and don't die all that often. This is one of those gems that doesn't let you quit playing like the best book or your favourite TV series. If you haven't played this one you have to buy if with all the expansions and let it take you on a breathtaking journey to Sapkowski's amazing world. The best adventure of your life guaranteed.

Jspotter89,"With The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, CD Projekt Red really establishes themselves as one of the game development studios to keep an eye on. What they have done here is nothing short of outstanding. Now, no game is perfect. The combat and inventory systems in The Witcher 3 could be polished a bit more, and the camera is a bit difficult to control, but outside of those concerns, this game might be the closest to perfection I've encountered in my 30 years of gaming. The world that you inhabit is dense, interesting, beautifully rendered, and full of depth for those who care to explore it. The quests are many, and it seems as though each one has an interesting little story to tell. The characters you encounter are well realized and developed, unlike anything I've seen in other games before. Enemies and boss battles are extremely varied, and require preparation and strategy to defeat. This is, quite simply, the game of the generation for me, unless and until someone else can craft a nearly perfect game that can make me want to sink hundreds of hours into it, and not feel like a single one of those hours was wasted.

FrankTCastle,"Good: Great story start to finish, I for one had no idea where it was going to take me next. You know at the end you will face the villain as you do with any story but most are fairly predictable. Every side quest is fun and interesting, never once was a I bored with a quest or felt like it was just another fetch and return. Crafting is fantastic, you can find many diagrams for standard and special Witcher gear to make, you can loot and craft runes to upgrade your gear even further with. Witcher gear diagrams come in tiers so it can be improved every few levels upto mastercrafted status. Graphics are great on the Xbox, faces especially are amazing and the textures on clothing and armour have never looked so real imo. Some things lack that detail like grass/leaves but that really is just nit picking on some peoples part. Bad: I found the skill tree seriously lacking and I never really looked forward to leveling up and often found I had not even noticed and there was several skill points waiting to be allocated. There is some good stuff in there but I would have liked more active abilities rather than so much passive stuff. For instance they could have had Heliotrop and Somne signs unlock in the magic skills. Yrden(trap) is useful once you invest heavily it has a dot effect and is good for crowd control. Ign ihas a very cool firestream ability later in the line. Bomb making can expand the slots to hold 8 bombs and turn them into cluster blombs. There is also a skill to make Geralt deflect and parry arrows. You can upgrade to parry arrows with your swords Other than that most of the skill tree is 1% here and 2% there which you expect in some RPGs but that kind of thing makes up the majority of Geralts leveling. Mutagens used to be very rare and extremely powerful things that would give Geralt unique perks or talents now they are just about every monster drops them and they do little more than increase stat modifiers. Some can make potions that are on a whole not especially useful imo. MILD ENDING SPOILER. For the game plus the game reverts to your save world before you start the last chapter which I found really disappointing since I was looking forward to exploring the world after the finale and hoping more high level quests and contracts would be opened up. Summary: Despite feeling the leveling up was kind of dull everything else kept me fully immersed in the game and as I said I mostly forgot about the leveling up, which is made up for by the amount of great and unique gear you can loot and craft.",9,2016-05-06,XBOX ONE,user

TrustyButler,"This is possibly the greatest game I have ever had the pleasure of playing, truly an incredible, next-gen experience. The scale and quality of this game is something to behold. Due to the sheer size of The Witcher 3, I will try to keep this as concise as possible. After sinking just over 120 hours into my first playthrough and only just completed the main story I was blown away when it ended. Everything is just so polished, from the graphics (for such a large game) to the individual storylines of each character, it oozes care and love for the craft. Having played Bethesda RPGS and considering them the 'to beat' RPG, The Witcher 3 has blown this perception into bits and now I will compare every single open-world RPG to this one as the benchmark. The biggest thing for me with this game was how mature the storytelling was, whether small, insignificant side quests or critical moments in the main story, every time it was coherent, grounded and always captivating. The greatest achievement was the (most of the time) unforseen consequences of your decisions which are sometimes small, but other times completely world-changing. Incredible. The world that CDProjektRed has created is sublime. It really does feel like a real life world - trees and grass blow in the wind, dynamic weather and incredible lighting (especially during sunsets), NPC chatter, pubs bustling with music, voices and clanging tankards. It totally immerses you into the gritty world The Witcher 3 is set in. And unlike Skyrim, it is actually apparent that a war is going on with camps and battlefields strewn across the landscape. Amazing. To top it all off, the maps are huge. Gameplay wise, it was tough getting used to, but the combat system is robust and feels great once mastered - you need to learn to be patient! There is looting, crafting, skill points everything an RPG demands. However the greatest success is definitely Gwent. Fantastic in-game card game with collectible cards littered throughout the world. If CDPR released just a pure Gwent mini game I would be all over it. SO good, so addictive. I could go on for another few paragraphs, but it's just best to buy it and experience it for yourself. A game of immense quality, value and will stand the test of time as one of the greats for sure.",10,2016-03-03,XBOX ONE,user

So many hours of gameplay, big open world, lush graphics, beautiful lighting and scenery. One of the best games so far on current gen Xbox ONE/PS4. Great story, so many sidequests and tons of hours of gameplay. Combat is still much better than in previous titles but still a little weird. Just nitpicking though. The only reason I gave it a 9/10 is because there were a couple of slight glitches here and there. GREAT game.",9,2016-02-18,XBOX ONE,user
drenvy2k9,"Sorry, Sorry, SORRY!!! I reviewed this game earlier this year, making a lot of comparisons to Skyrim. I made the mistake of reviewing the game before completing it! and now I absolutely want to change and update my review. Last time, my main complaint was the lack of ""vastness"" that the game had in both exploration physically and in the story, mainly compared to Skyrim. I still have to say there still has been nothing like the incredible, sweeping, and varied environments and landscapes of Skyrim, but really what has changed my mind was one word/ place: Skellige. FINALLY! Here are the beautiful mountains, sea, and variation in altitude I was looking for! The little villages with their own interesting people and mini-cultures! Different monsters and villains! Also, once you get to Skellige, the story ramps up in major ways, both centrally and peripherally. And that's the last thing that has really, really swayed me. Whereas in Velen and Novigrad, you are mainly doing fetch quests and seemingly going nowhere in the story, once you finish the Skellige quests, finally major things start to happen that really suprised me and took me for quite an enjoyable ride, and the last few missions and the ending really, really put a nice little icing on the cake. Actually, I'm not sure how you can finish this game and not immediately want to play it again. I also wanted to add a few extra points for the Heart of Stone add-on. I really enjoyed- again it starts slow, but ends unexpectedly. I had to look up a few things to end it the ""right"" way; Gaunter O' Dimm/ Master of Mirrors is a GREAT character. Don't waste your time on the Runewright missions though- just a money dump- poor show!! I am playing the New Game + on Death March now. Really the only critiques I have are some of the mechanics. The horse riding can get a bit clunky, especially when you are enjoying yourself, riding like the wind, and then...ooops, the game decides that THIS is the hill/ cliff that the horse can't jump done. JUMP you F__KER! The transition between swimming and getting on land also can get pretty irritating, as sometimes you can't find one f--king piece of shore that the programmers have made ""climbable."" But then sometimes, it SEEMS like Geralt is going to get on shore, but then randomly JUMPS the OTHER way back on to the shore- this can get pretty irritating after a while. I wish they would fix this. All in all- great f--king game and can't wait for Blood and Wine!!",9,2016-02-18,XBOX ONE,user

dunboy7,"Simply put my favourite game of all time, I have sunk over 500 hrs into this game and theres still stuff to do!!! I'm no hardcore gamer but this game is just ridiculously good. The main story is incredibly deep with excellent voice work for all the characters. The combat is satisfying with a fantastic progression system, admittedly this game can be a bit a brutal early on but as soon as you get a few levels up and some decent gear its fine a can offer a real challenge on the harder difficulty levels. The side quests are probably the real stand out feature as these are beautifully fleshed out and varied you can be solving a Sherlock Holmes style murder mystery with multiple outcomes or you can be competing in a high stakes card game in a posh brothel! there really are so many interesting things to. Speaking of the card game it is called qwent and is quite possibly my favourite part of the witcher 3, it is incredibly addictive and soon becomes an obsession to build up a strong deck to compete with some of the best players, I really wish they could have added an online qwent tournament so I could keep playing this even after the game is 100% finished. The graphics are sublime for a game of this size the world itself is beautiful with animals roaming around real time weather and some of the best sunsets I've yet to witness within a RPG. Some of the landscapes you witness can take your breath away! I am constantly pausing the game to admire whats in-front of me and often screen shot to use as my dashboard background. Now again the frame-rate can dip but after the last few updates it seems to have smoothed out now. The story is seriously for adults, there is rarely a clear right or wrong choice, you can be thinking about decisions you've made for hours after and even see the results later in the game too. The ending can alter drastically depending on these choices. There is quite a lot of gore and nudity and at times feels like the video game version of Game of Thrones which is no bad thing! Ive barely scratched the surface on what makes this game great. It does ask for a huge commitment from the player to see all it has to offer but no game has ever been more worthy of your time in my opinion! Without doubt one of the best games ever made! If you haven't played it yet and enjoy vast open fantasy world RPG's like Skyrim or oblivion this is a no brainier I only wish I had a top of the range PC to enjoy this game at its very best but even on xbox one its incredible!",10,2016-01-16,XBOX ONE,user
Aladgar,"I give 7/10. Game is really cool and I want to give 10/10. So story is really good while lots of other things are good too. I really like this game but -1 because of the graphics. It's ok (I have xboxone I don't know the others) but sometimes the ""appearance"" of the environments is slow. I mean I can see how the trees appear instead of the trees are already on the screen. That's annoying. Other -1 is because of the horde of really stupid bugs. Like I can go under the pier with a boat (so the sails will be inside the pier...) or when the enemies with shield just standing and I can easily go behind them... and so on. The third -1 is because sometimes my last 2-3 saves are just gone. The game is really cool and I really like it but I can't give 10/10 because of these annoying things. I really want to give the 10 so I hope they will solve these problems with patches and than it's a really really big 10/10! :)",7,2016-01-16,XBOX ONE,user
Elbxleon,"I don't know where to begin. The main story is superbly written. The characters truly come alive with emotion. The fighting mechanics and adversaries faced can be challenging, yet extremely rewarding when defeated. At times, even the side quests were indistinguishable from the main plot given how well developed they were. The look and feel of the characters, the voice acting, the intricacies of each monster, and photo realistic environments are some of the best I have ever seen in a game. Even the soundtrack can't be faulted. I literally watched for 15 minutes as my character simply stood by a scenic lake at dawn just to watch the sun rise and witness a storm at a distance slowly change the environment in such a beautifully realistic way. Sometimes it was just the minute details that told you the developers put extreme care into creating this fantastic RPG.

The choices in this game generally matter, the combat is fun, and the graphics and world are gigantic.

nibblo,"Game is very buggy, it amazes me that Fallout 4 gets so much crap for being a buggy mess but I only encountered one time when I got stuck outside the police station with the Brotherhood of Steel, in The Witcher I was bugging out to the Xbox One dashboard every few hours and the quest with the merchant and bandits could never be finished if you didn't kill the merchant on horseback but somehow this game gets a pass!? Levelling is incredibly slow and if you make a wrong choice on which skill you upgrade good luck to you, it took me countless times to get through the caves when I followed the wild hunt because I didn't know I needed certain things like upgrading a specific magic skill and having bombs but could I go back and do these things? No. The inventory system is a mess, quests are run of the mill fetch and kill, Geralt sounds like a depressed clint eastwood character, difficulty levels on quests are random so one side quest could be easy and the one next door next to impossible. Just lazy design work hidden behind the justification of explore and come back idealogy. Games like Baldurs Gate did this type of thing so much better back in the day and this is really just a FP version of those games not done as well. Graphics are nice and some of the story beats are good but they are hiding a sub par game. Unfortunately everyone seems to be going gah gah for this game and it will probably get game of the year looking at the reviews but buyer beware you have to ignore a lot of shortcomings and be prepared to put up with a lot of lazy design here.",4,2015-12-30,XBOX ONE,user
phuck-overkill,"Pros: Just about everything about this game is incredible. Even with the unfortunate graphical downgrade it still looks amazing. The story, characters, and setting are just incredible and lifelike, this game really pulled me into its world. A single playthrough will take you about 70-80 hours if you rush, and can easily break 100 hours if you explore everything. CD Projekt Red are my favorite developer right now, for good reason. Not just for the quality work they've done with the Witcher series but also because of their business practices. They continued to support the game by releasing free DLC which included new armor sets, hair/facial hair options, outfits for other NPCs, weaponry, AND new quests. All that for free, in this day and age? It's wonderful. In addition, they are releasing 2 expansion packs. Actual expansion packs with new locations, characters, storylines, and so many more hours of content. They really lift my spirits when seemingly almost every other developer/publisher wants to just defecate out a game, and support it for a limited time with paid DLC. Cons: The only downside to this game that I see most people complain about is the combat. I can understand why, it is sort of basic. You're essentially limited to swords (although there are axes, their stats are almost always outclassed by Witcher swords) and the crossbows are more of a tool to stumble enemies/bring down flying enemies. But there are some other ways to make combat more interesting. Witcher signs (spells) that you can cast, and potions to collect and craft. All in all it was good enough for me.",10,2015-12-30,XBOX ONE,user
NexusTsunami,"CD Project Red hat eines wirklich geschafft. Eine rießige und immersive Open World mit einer packenden Story verbunden. Einzig das Kampfsystem und die Charakterentwicklung sind nicht das was ich mir gewünscht hätte. Nicht falsch verstehen, wir haben in diesem Spiel ein solides, flottes und durchaus spaßiges Battlesystem bekommen. Allerdings fehlt es mir in Verbindung mit der erwähnten Charakterentwicklung an Aktiven Fähigkeiten (Wirbel, Zerfleischen und die Zeichen... nicht viel) und einer tieferen Charakterindividualisierung (12 Slots für Perks WTF). Somit kommt mir TW3:WH in diesen Aspekten eher wie ein extrem gutes Action-Adventure vor. Allerdings...dies ist meine einzige Kritik an diesem Spiel. Ich persönlich lege bei RPG´s einfach sehr viel Wert auf ein Kampfsystem mit Aktiven Skills und eine tiefgreifende Charakterentwicklung. Wenn ich davon absehe und diese zwei dennoch soliden Aspekte als gegeben hinnehme, ist TW3:WH ein überaus immersives und spannendes Spiel welches mich für viele Stunden vor den Bildschirm gefesselt hat.

The amount of work that has gone into this is overwhelming when you stop to think about it. The world is huge and filled with people, monsters and quests. It seems as if 1 in every 10 people you meet in the world has their own story or problem to solve. CDPR have outdone themselves, and have set a new standard for others to strive towards. If anything, i feel quite sad that this is the first game i played on XBONE .... i think i should have started with Fallout 4, or other Open World RPGs as i can't see those games coming close to the magnificence of this game.

SchroederRock,"The Witcher 3 is a great game that gets in its own way. No history lessons for new players which would have been severely helpful in early game dialog where people, places and events are constantly referenced without any explanation. You engage with a fairly important player and are required to offer an account of what happened in the past couple games (I'm assuming) - boneheaded mistake here, something that was not necessary in any way and yet Warner Bros IE felt it necessary to throw it in. And that's my feeling for several parts of the game, like buying/selling items acquired, certain crafting professions, and leveling - they all are half baked here and, while they work, all of these things are incomplete in their design and execution. I hate having to scroll with a thumbstick just to get to items are are for sale. These are all things Dragon Age: Inquisition, a game that is comparable to Witcher 3, did much better. But when you get out into the world you might let this all go, because it's a gorgeous game for being dumbed down (graphically) on consoles and is very expansive. I love RPGs, and if you don't mind a little lack of polish in certain game mechanics and supporting professions/trades, you'll definitely enjoy The Witcher's 3 good character development, longer unfolding story and great visuals.",8,2015-12-13,XBOX ONE,user
sprinkill,"I started playing video games on MS-DOS back in the 80s (think Pac Man, Dig Dug, Paratrooper, etc.). I then graduated to Nintendo, SNES, XBOX, 360, PC, XBOX ONE, and countless other platforms. I'm a pretty seasoned gamer and I've played thousands of games. The Witcher 3 is the best video game I've ever played. The last time I felt this way was when I played Deus Ex back in 2000. Obviously, Deus Ex is nothing by today's standards, but it was a landmark game back then. Well, The Witcher 3 not only brought that feeling back to me, but multiplied by a factor of 5, at least. The quality of this game is incomprehensible. It's unfortunate, in a way. I played Fallout 4 immediately after finishing this game. How do ya' think that game stacked up in comparison? Not well, obvsly. FO4 is like a ball on a stick compared TW3. I have a feeling that's going to be my finding on most games going forward.

johnbobs1,"Having read many reviews about this game before purchasing it myself, I was expecting something truly special. Indeed, the Witcher 3 is a generally beautiful and interesting game to play. The game is based around a ''Witcher'' named Geralt of Rivia. He is one of the witcher caste; A guild of warrior mages with incredible abilities, who wander the wilds of the kingdom and complete contracts to get rid of monsters and other nasties. In terms of both graphics and sound effects, this is a hugely impressive game. Landscapes are beautifully drawn and attention to detail on things such as grasses and bushes blowing in the wind, clouds in the sky and city-scapes are all stunning. But even better are the game's sound numerous effects. Speech samples are faultless - You'll encounter many hundreds of characters on your wanders throughout the game, and nearly all of them will have something different to shout at you as you pass - often quite amusing. Character acting is also excellent (strangely - other than Geralt). There are SFX for just about everything in the game - probably the most impressive thing about the experience of playing it. Gameplay-wise, these witcher contracts (generally side quests in the game) are pleasing to undertake. The variety of enemies you'll encounter, in terms of appearance, behaviour and abilities means that you're never assured of an easy time. The combat system in the witcher is generally satisfying to use as well, once you've mastered it. Many of the plot lines of the quests are also extremely interesting and immersive at first, and involve many interesting characters - all with enormous amount of detail paid to them. In terms of challenge, things can be fairly tough at times, even once you've become accustomed to the rigours of battle. What keeps this game from being an all time classic and sees it as merely very good are the fact that it seems to contain numerous flaws. It is all too easy to misjudge a battle sequence and end up dying unavoidably - cue the incredibly frustrating long loading time until you respawn from your last save point. The writing on the in game menu's is far too small, there are far too many graphical glitches, certain elements of the game can become repetitive, storylines drag on a bit too long at times. All of these things are not major problems on their own, but unfortunately add up and prevent a great game from being an incredible one.",8,2015-12-11,XBOX ONE,user
petekwando,"Having never played the previous two games in the series, I picked up this one as a curiosity, something to play while waiting for other games to be released. over 100 hours later, I'm still playing, and it is without a doubt the best game I've played this year. This game is simply a master class in how to do narrative games right: quest design, writing, voice acting and animation, all are top notch, and should raise the bar for the whole industry going forward. Yes, the lore is dense, and the combat learning curve is steep at first. But learning both was ultimately rewarding, and complimented the story instead of detracting from it, or being completely detached from it. As I didn't play the game until months after it came out, I can't say for certain how many bugs were present at release, but I can say that, a few graphics glitches and occasional crashes aside, I encountered relatively few issues, and no unrecoverable problems. Many thanks to the team at CDPR for creating such a fantastic game, and for pushing to do better with each product they release, instead of resting on past laurels as so many other game companies have done.",9,2015-12-07,XBOX ONE,user

OneHonestReview,"Risen is one of the worst rpg games from last gen. This is risen for the next gen just labeled differently. Here is an honest review. The world which you travel is open world, Beautiful and wait, wait a second. No. No it's not. The world is not open and if you think it is you are a darn right fool. It is a segment map which means it is not open. You can zoom out on the entire map which then shows areas you can go to. This does not make it open world. The fact I can't ride the worlds most **** horse from the road that is shown on the map to the overall area to another is just horrible. It is not open world if you think so, you are clearly not the brightest cookie in the jar. They try to make it seem alive with the NPC's but has anyone even noticed they just do the same thing, the same kid is in the same puddle every day singing the same song. **** off with that. The graphics are standard nothing special. It only looks slightly better than a risen game. The world itself is boring and lack luster with stupid NPC's trying to make it feel alive. No once did I look at this game in awe with the sun shining down across these really boring places that all look the same, nothing sticks out. The world is dead with no real atmosphere. It just feels like a game. The movements. Ahh this is where the game truly falls apart. Playing a GAME you'd think the most important aspect really would be this... GAMEPLAY. Clearly not for CDPR. It is clunky, every swing of the sword is weightless, I might as well be holding a feather duster. The combat tries to copy Dark souls with it's timing and what not but fails, there is no weight, it is boring and the camera angles do not help, especially when you have multiple enemies on you, even three!! It becomes a chore, panning the camera yourself only to be smacked but a **** then as you stagger the rest come and gangbang you and opps its game over, hit load last save and go make yourself a cuppa cause that ****ing loading screen. Walking in this game is a hard task as is horse riding with **** roach. ""Look a small rock I must halt master, I am no match for tiny rock"" says **** roach. This is a next gen game in 2015. Games before this such as red dead had better horse handling, The best horse handling I've ever played has come from MGSV. There is no excuse to get this wrong when games from the past and present can do it better than you have done. The inventory. Holy **** balls. Try to go through it and it is just killing your brain cells one by one. It is so messy it's like someone couldn't get to the toilet, **** all over the floor and said hey, inventory system. Alchemy. It **** plain and simple, Idk where to get these flowers or items really it does not give you any hint at all, which can be okay, hand holding in a game is kinda annoying, but when half the ****ing flowers look the ****ing same I just think how the **** and I meant to know what I'm doing. What the hell does this item even do, well you will probably never know, as the game doesn't really tell you. One thing that really pissed me off is the fact in game some one said I'm centuries old. So I'm a master witcher, wise and knowledgeable. So I do a quest, where I'm to fight a werewolf, He even said in his grumbling voice I'm looking for a werewolf, yet there is **** all in bestiary so idk what other things it hates apart from my silver sword and fire cause not many things with fur like fire. So I think to hell with this google will answer me. I google it, there are other things to use only problem is HOW THE HELL DO YOU GET IT!!!???!!! A bomb that is not in my crafting inventory, idk where to get it there is not indication. I will never find it I give up. I was playing it with a mate and I look at my level okay, I've got 725 exp, I go off and fight a **** ton of things, wolves, drowners, bears. Look at my exp 745. Are you actually kidding me, I start yelling and laughing because the fact you can't level up from fighting things in the ""Open World"" means there is no point what so ever to getting of **** roach and fighting. Anything apart from the quests are there for meaningless. Though I also did a quest and revived 25 exp... Yeah it helped so much and did not waste my time having to listen to a boring cut scene with some **** spouting nonsense. In short. The world is dead and baron. The combat is ****ty and broken. The controls are piss poor. The graphics are nothing special. The horse should just go away I can run and jump and get to where I want faster with less difficult navigation. The inventory system is an abomination. Camera angles are just a no no especially in witcher sense mode. This game is over hyped and over rated. It's nothing special. Also why does everyone have a ****ing ostrich neck?",3,2015-11-25,XBOX ONE,user

Fade88,"I didn't enjoy Witcher 2, this game is better in every way. Now I've finished it there is a gaping hole in my life that only beheading a bandit or incinerating a horde of nekkers can fill. The graphics are beautiful, combat responsive, simple yet with layers of complexity that develop with your ability and the voice acting and writing has that British sense of humour that fable did so well well with a few more obscenities and very creative insults. Quite simply the biggest gaming surprise I've had since the tomb raider reboot, it just does everything right and never feels dull or repetitive. I rarely used fast travel which says a lot for the quality and richness of the world design. Geralt may look like 'pale oaty s***e' but this game makes every other RPG pale in comparison to its glorious ambition and impeccable execution.",10,2015-11-11,XBOX ONE,user

Haldir,"Honestly, I've never become attached to characters until I played the Witcher 3. The gameplay is actually very entertaining, and the story is beyond amazing and interesting. Masterpieces of scenery compliment the numerous side quests that aren't merely fetch quests or repetitive ideas. Not to mention Gwent, which in its own, can be considered funner than some games out there right now. All in all, the tale of Geralt and Ciri in the third Witcher installment has potential for GOTY, and with characters like Triss and Yen, and even Zoltan, I hope this game gets it.",10,2015-11-06,XBOX ONE,user

I played TW3 through and did everything I could, not once does it feel repetitious. There is a genuine 100+ hours to had from this game and it remains feeling fresh throughout. On paper it's by far the best £/$ per hour of genuine gaming experience you will buy.

bilbo1973,"I did not like the Witcher games... I somehow found them to be toooo huge for my available game playing time. And then I saw the video with the Specter in the haunted house. And gave a try to W3. And got hooked - for good! It's one of those ""Avatar games"" I'd call them: you live your normal life and then you press play and get totally lost into their world. A world that treats you like the hero and mutant, like the savior or worst nightmare. A world that your choices change the course of the story and the way things are done. Great balance of storytelling, fighting, crafting, questing... You can get as much or as little from the game as you wish - however I assure you that you will often find yourselves galloping like crazy from one question mark to the other to get the area cleared (usually at +02:00 am). ...and the card game rocks (although my initial thought was ""No time for that crap..."")

MooseSpoon,"I took some time to come back to this game after it was patched up. The control issues were fixed. The inventory bugging was fixed. Performance has dropped, but the game feels a lot smoother. The story still has replay value and you do have options to change for each play through. Very rarely do I play through a game like this more than once, but I welcome a replay of this game. Though I still have my opinions of Yen and Triss. Also, I do like that the DLC is pretty much being handed to the players. It feels like the developers went against the current grain and made a game they would like to play and didn't tax the players. (This is where I glare at EA.) If you haven't played this game and you have a system that can run it well, I suggest at least trying it. The graphics are good. The story is good.

There are many things I'd like to say about W3, but simply read the high-end reviews and you've got the picture. The diversity and scale of this RPG is almost unbeatable. The one thing that brought this game down for me was the combat mechanics, of which I'm not a big fan of.

Reaverwind,"I'd consider Witcher 3 a great game were it not for a number of issues. The inventory system is a mess. For an action game, the controls are sometimes surprisingly unresponsive. Quest-scaling is all over the place. Loot scaling system is designed to almost consistently reward the player with garbage. The experience is also marred by the game being built around two contradictory design philosophies: 1) Geralt should be poor 2) Geralt has to constantly upgrade his equipment - which a poor Geralt should not be able to do. This built-in contradiction in design forces the player to focus too much time on scouring the gameworld for the means to upgrade, which can become quite tedious. That being said, with the way CDPR has been patching for XBox One, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game. Every patch has introduced problems, but the latest one really takes the cake: -all DLC's broken -reduced functionality -new graphics issues, some of which are migraine-inducing -new AI bugs -downgraded performance (again) -missing items -savegame issues",2,2015-10-14,XBOX ONE,user

Later on I purchased on the spur of the moment and then suddenly found myself in one of the most epic gaming adventures of all time. I have played a lot of games since the 90's including all the top titles, however this is undoubtedly the greatest game of forever. It has set a new precedence in the gaming industry - it is graphically stunning in-depth and rich, however the story line is epic. I have never played a game where the consequences of my decisions made such an impact. For me this game was a connection with a beautiful story, the first moment arriving in Ard Skellige and the pan pipe music faintly playing in the background whilst admiring the stunning scenery was the most epic moment I have experienced in any game during my life. CDPR have not made a game, they have made a masterpiece, this should be Game of the Year, Decade, Century and History. In a word... Perfect",10,2015-10-12,XBOX ONE,user

The graphics are very beautiful, colorful and full of life, From all the wild mythical creatures roaming the lands to the griffins soaring in sky. The Soundtrack is so epic and goes perfectly with combat and the theme of the world. The Witcher III: Wild Hunt is has set the new standard for open world games.

Roldaddy78,"To sum it up quickly, The Witcher is a Fable NC-17. It is a good game with a compelling story. That's what kept me playing. The menu system is overly complicated. The game is super glitchy and has a terrible ""Save Bug"", that I thought was fixed. I had to replay sizable portions of the game because of this. The combat is almost very good. When you enter combat, the camera zooms in and gives you a limited view of your surroundings. This is not a big deal with 1 on 1 boss battles, but can be aggravating when fighting a group of mobs. I also found the combat and on foot traversal to be very jumpy. All in all it's good game.

As far as the game, content, and story go, the game is AMAZING! However, since the release of the latest patch (1.07) there have been a ton of new bugs introduced that simply make the game unplayable. I am rating this game a 6.

They did not attempt to match level from MOB to player making this game very grindy. The story is linear and as far as RPGs go this is one of the worst I've ever played. The controls and camera angle are rough. You can't target with your sword and its pretty much you hope you end up where you need to be to land your next attack. The ranged attack is primitive, there are 8 bit games with better aim than this (cant call it cross hairs because its a dot). The mini-map is underdeveloped and so is the world map. They made the world pretty, but a pretty game with crap controls, linear story, and uninteresting plot doesn't make a good RPG.

Sometimes you circle around this item many times before you can gather the ingredients. The tutorial tries to do a good job explaining the menus, but if you blink or look down to grab your beer, you will miss it. It is also very boring and time consuming. the Witcher has to constantly talk to his horse every time you speed up or slow down and it is so repetitive. Want some positives? the Graphics are amazing.

shenoc16,"Let me start of by saying this is the best game released this year, so far. There are many other that could kick it of the number one spot from my shelf. Game play is good, story is great and you can always intervene in situation were you would normally just be a spectator, combat system is better than the witcher 2 and plenty of side quests to go around. The graphics are amazing. Talking about bugs I've not witnessed many just your average floating/limbless/headless NPC. My biggest complaint would have to be the controls for Roach, your horse, he stops for no good reason in the middle of the road just because there is a small rock in his way but he isn't bothered by the walls that he keeps running into, and i simply cannot grasp how you would be able to jump over broken bridges, I simply can't do it even in order to save my life. Also there should be some way to implement a way for the enemies to level up with you, as a lvl 24 fighting lvl 5 monsters is really simple, but don't underestimate those downers, I can recall numerous times when i was nearly killed by low level mobs because i was too cocky.I guess on the PC version mods could be added, but what about the consoles? come on CD project red, give is that.

Neologian,"What game are all the positive reviewers playing? Graphics are nice & voice acting is decent. Okay, but then what? General character movement is clunky with scores of hidden snag points and frustrating camera movement. Combat movement is dismal and unresponsive resulting in constant failures to block, dodge, and strike on a regular basis. Inventory management system is THE WORST I've seen in decades. Leveling is slow and level ups inconsequential. Opponent level matching is out of whack and this combined with the horrible combat mechanics results in frequent untimely deaths even in early encounters. Quests are nearly all simple and brainless ""go fetch"" or ""get through dialogue"" affairs with most being impossible to complete in the early game due to their required level and the combat and encounter level issues noted earlier. Witcher 3 is a visually decent game wrapped around some of THE WORST in-game and inventory mechanics I've seen in a very long time. Disappointing purchase.",1,2015-07-08,XBOX ONE,user

thedirtyrussian,"Let's weigh the pros and cons of this game. Starting with the positives, the game is massive, and has lots of quests and content to keep you busy for a very long time. The graphics are nice and the voice acting is great. The story keeps you going, and all the colorful characters you meet are interesting and diverse. More so than even the main character of the game. Another positive is that the standard version of the game comes with a map, Soundtrack, and even lore booklet to explain backstory. Now that is something we rarely see these days in gaming. Now for the bad. Like I mentioned earlier, the main protagonist is bland. I know he is supposed to be a Witcher devoid of emotion, but I found him deeply boring and rather one-dimensional. The combat is wonky at first, but once you are used to it, it can be enjoyable. The difficulty in this game is staggering; and I've played many RPG's. I found the harder difficulty levels to be impossible. But the worst thing in this game are the cutscenes. Sure, I love the story and characters, but the cutscenes were one too many in this game. I found myself skipping a lot because I forgot at times I was even playing a game at all; I felt like I was watching a movie. Which in some cases can be good, but for me, not so much. There were also minor glitches throughout the game, but I never ran into anything major. All in all you WILL get your money's worth, and you will find yourself lost for hours in the game, which is all we can really ask for as gamers.",8,2015-07-02,XBOX ONE,user
BarisB,"A true masterpiece in every aspect. I haven't played a game as good as Witcher 3 since long time. This game is incomparably better than DAI so i am not going to get in comparisons. Every detail, every character and every side mission is carefully hand tailored in this game. Some features of this game such as enemies are not levelling with you is what i appreciate most. I always thought that was the worst thing about Skyrim.",10,2015-06-30,XBOX ONE,user
AlpaChino800,"So close to a perfect game. There are a few glitches, none I have encountered were game breaking. The horse controls are a bit wonky. That's about it, fantastic in all other areas",9,2015-06-28,XBOX ONE,user

superjoon,"The first aspect that I'm going to talk about in this review, are the graphics and the worlds. Simply put, they are fantastic and absolutely gorgeous, this is probably one of if not the best looking game I have come across. The detail in the world is fantastic, from the buildings right down to the foliage. The trees and the grass swaying in the wind is simply divine, the cities are fantastically built and the swamps even look the business. I think the graphics and worlds are helped out by the lighting, which again for me is simply stunning, the way the light hits everything and the progress of time with the sun, where you can see at 5am if you leave a building that there is a low sun and that it is blinding, just how it would be if I was to go out... Well.. Not so much in the UK anyway, but you get the picture. To be honest, for a lot of this game, words cannot do it justice, its one of those things where seeing is believing. The character models used in the game, there has been a lot of care taken over these, and it a joy to see how much care has been taken. Especially in the close up scenes where you can see every line, scar, marking etc. There is so much detail that has gone into  making these characters, its just fantastic to see and I have to applaud CD Projekt Red for the effort that has gone into, not only the characters but the game as a whole. However, the only thing that is a bug bear with me is the fact that there seems to be limited Character Models. I have seen the same model of character used several times for different people and that has been a little disappointing to see. If its going to be characters you interact with, then there should be different models for those people. When you speak to people in the town and they're not important to a quest, then OK as you don't really get the full shot of the person, but if it is someone to do with a quest and your going to go into a cut scene with them to discuss something, they should look different to the commanding solider that you spoke to 5 minutes previous. In regards to the missions, what I have liked is they haven't all been a certain type of mission, there's plenty to do and you can mix that up with side missions as well. Missions also vary in time as well, some missions can take you 2 minutes... Im looking at you Frying Pan Contract!.... others can take you 30-45 minutes... This might just be me and the way I play, other people may do it quicker, but I like to be thorough in my missions... Also I get stuck a lot lol!! I have found the characters quite easy to make an attachment to as well, which I think helps when playing the storyline and keeping going with the game, if the characters were boring then I think it could be a harder story to follow, and I may have been inclined to finish it quicker to get it out of the way. Another thing that I really enjoy with this game is the fact that everyone's play through will be different, and this is down to the the choices you make as well as if you do side missions in between the main missions. I've been doing a few side missions here and there just to try and help rank my character up for the later missions which are going to need a higher ranked character and weapons. There are a lot of different ways to upgrade your character, too many to fit them all in, so you have to be smart and think about how you're going to have your character. Which way are you going to be? Stronger, better at Alchemy, Magic? The choice is yours! The fighting mechanics in the game I have found to be a little sluggish at times, but love seeing Geralt hit a finishing move and seeing a head roll.... Beautiful fluidity. The controls as well took me a while to get used to and for someone who is playing the series for the first time may have found them over complicated, there's a lot of things to remember as pretty much every button does something and its making sure you pressing the right button and using the correct weapon for the Human/Beast you are fighting. Unfortunately, with the good comes the bad. There have been issues with the game which for me are unforgivable. One issue, which I feel is so serious I don't think the game should be released with, and think that if these games are tested by Microsoft before released, why it wasn't picked up. That issue is a save game issue. First 3 hours of game play I did, I died after being ambushed by bandits, save wouldn't load, I had to hard reset my console, after it came back on the save was nowhere to be found, not even in the cloud. Gone. After I reported it on Twitter, there seemed to be a lot of other people who had suffered same as me, although some people were lucky and didn't lose their save game. I was furious, all that work had gone down the pan. I also encountered frame rate issues in the game, which pretty much happens on most cut scenes, which begs the question, why wasn't this picked up in testing? Why is it now acceptable to release a game with bugs?",9,2015-06-24,XBOX ONE,user
ToFewViews,"Witcher 3 is a step forward in RPG's, It shows just how big and immersive you can make a modern day RPG. Within the first few hours of the game I had a overwhelming amount of side-quests and points of interest just in the first **** I liked it, it gives you the feeling of being in a real active world where your actions matter, witch they do. Every little thing you do in The Witcher 3 could come back full circle to you, even the smallest things. The story of The Witcher games have all been good mostly thanks to the Witcher Books the series is based **** Witcher 3 follows suit for the most part, at times you feel like your just running from A to B to help someone so they will in turn help you by giving you info for the 2 people you are looking **** that IS what a ""Witcher"" is he is a hired monster killer and you do lots of that. Harpies,Griffins,Spirits and Cannibals are just a few of the foes you have to decapitate and cut in **** combat in the game is very smooth and feels great, All enemies have there own weaknesses and strengths you need to learn and use against them. Some being Oils or Potions you can craft to make you stronger against that type of foe or a time of day that is better to fight it. The developer CD Project Red worked extremely hard on bringing the best possible experience they could to the PS4 and Xbox One, The game still suffers from some frame rate issues and stuttering but it doesn't stop you from enjoying the game very much. The PC version of the game is much better in that subject (If you have a good PC). But regardless of how the game runs if your a fan of RPGs you owe it to yourself to give your Time to ""The Witcher 3:Wild Hunt"" and it's lots of time trust me, you differently get your moneys worth.",10,2015-06-22,XBOX ONE,user
countyourmacros,"Let's start with the good! The lighting was well done, excellent variety in enemies, and the lore and storyline are very well done. So yeah, that's basically all the good I can say. TL;DR rating at the end of each segment. Now onto the bad... The voice acting was AWFUL and it complete ruins any immersion despite how hard you try to like it (and believe me I tried very hard to like this game). 0/10 The graphics aren't as advertised and are not what you'd expect from a game at this point in the next gen console's life. AC Unity has far better graphics despite being nearly a year old. 5.5/10 Music is okay, but not nearly as good as Skyrim's. I still give it a 7/10 since they didn't cut corners here. Combat is horrible and needlessly over complicated, considering you only have like two-three weapons and 5 spells. Even on the easy modes you die too quickly. The blocking mechanic is choppy and useless if you're against a group of enemies. The dodge/roll button does nothing since most enemies can attack you while you're rolling. 0/10 The crafting/alchemy thing is awful too. Remember how Far Cry 4 had an annoying number of plants for making potions? Well this game is even worse for that. It's not like you can forego this though, as you need potions/oils to fight certain enemies. 0/10 The gameplay and controls are awful. It is such a pain to try and use a ladder, mount your horse, swim, etc... GTA has generally bad swimming mechanics, but they seem godly compared to this game's swimming mechanics. I literally will do 4 underwater backflips and drown before I resurface. -5/10 This is an even bigger disappointment than Destiny. 2/10",2,2015-06-22,XBOX ONE,user

notcbram,"The Witcher 3 delivers everything that an RPG should, it's a game that made me believe in games again. I've been searching for a good title on the XBox One, I tried Dragon Age: Inquisition, which is, fir lack of a better word, dull. I tried every other title out there, and then finally, out came The Witcher 3. It looks beautiful, sure, but that's only skin deep. This is one of the only games where I'm scared to carry on the main quest line, just in case my experience is over. There's so much to see and do and each new thing feels as important as the last. Your decisions can have real implications in the world and it shows us that the world of the Witcher, as with real life, is not always black and white. What seems like the 'right' decision can often have horrible consequences if you don't think it through fully. And the developers are completely en pointe, releasing 16 free dlc's, listening to complaints and fixing them quickly (even working through national holidays to make and release updates). No game is ever going to be perfect, hence no 10/10, there's always going to be some **** and bugs, but this is as close to the perfect game as there is at the moment, it's certainly the best RPG.

GainesvilleGuy,"I'm going with an 8 for total score for this. Some aspects of it are a 10 but some things only around a 5 or so. Since most of the reviews here focus on the positives, I'm going to focus on the negatives instead just to give a non-haters view of what is wrong with this game. Again, there is a lot of great things here so don't take this as recommendation not to play it. But the 3 items below keep this from being the game of the year and instead just very good: 1) Why does the Witcher start the game at Level 1 with no oils or potions unlocked and crappy level 1 gear? This is the third installment of the game, his buddy even jokes he is 100+ years old, he's been like the top dog Witcher for decades, yet he starts at level 1 with no oils/potions unlocked and garbage gear/sword??? I think they needed to build this into the story somehow, but instead it is just like ""Here is the great Witcher top dog but since this is RPG just level him up from peasant anyway."" As much time and detail the devs put into this game this aspect was just plain lazy. 2) Inventory management is tedious. Absolutely tedious. I don't get why they needed all of the various crafting materials. It's not like you can go searching for them, there is no guide to where to find what materials. It is just a giant RNG of hundreds of mats that clog up the inventory. As they pile up in the crafting tab there is like a 1 second delay whenever you highlight the crafting tab because it is so full of crafting junk. 3) Combat is too easy once you get used to it. Really only the clunkiness of it gets you killed sometimes. I played this on hard mode and at first I thought it was difficult, but dodging is overpowered. Just dodge away from the action and you can't be beaten. Combat is only really challenging when you are in tight quarters but then you end up getting hung up on furniture, fences, etc. and the clunky control become frustrating, but at least a bit challenging. Overall though I think the game is definitely worth buying/playing due to the many positive things you can read in other reviews..",8,2015-06-18,XBOX ONE,user

MrWinklestein,"This game is huge, it's beautiful, it's fun, it's challenging, it's complex. It's probably the GOTY. The side quests are a step above pretty much anything else I've seen, providing meaningful rewards and great variety. The combat is great and there's nothing more satisfying than a dismembering finisher. There are a great variety of enemies, each of which has its own weaknesses and strengths. There are also some really strong female characters that help move along the main story. Geralt can be a little dry and humorless at times, but hey, he's a witcher.",10,2015-06-17,XBOX ONE,user

ValVonSputz,"Having not played either of the previous two games in the trilogy, I do not feel one bit lost on the story line of The Witcher. I am a huge RPG fan and this game delivers. Deep story lines, multi-dimensional characters, satisfying combat, hundreds of hours of quests, and extensive crafting and alchemy options. As for travel, I specifically enjoy the quest marker that also shows you the route to take. This saves SO much time that, in the past (in Skyrim, for instance), would have been wasted climbing a mountain in every way imaginable to reach my destination. The Witcher 3 also does not give up experience or gold as readily as many other games. It truly makes you work for it, which is a plus, in my opinion. This gives the incentive to keep at it to achieve game changing perks. The reason it's not a perfect 10 is because of the minor glitches that one will experience. For instance, loot that is made visible with Witcher senses but cannot be picked up, etc. Even given these small issues, this game is the best I've played to date.",9,2015-06-15,XBOX ONE,user
rapology,"One of the most ambitious games to date has managed to subjectively earn a near perfect score upon the first 100 hours of my foray in to the World of Gerald and my subsequent adventure throughout all of the Northern Kingdoms. After much fanfare and anticipation, this game garnered a reputation that preceded itself, realised in the immersive and expansive world that has become Witcher lore and a quintessential gem of roll playing adventures, exceeding my wildest expectations. There are so many strong points to this game it's hard to list them all but if I was to surmise it all with a terse dialogue I would state the strongpoints of this game stand with the awesome adventures of of Gerlad and his companions. This adventure plays out so fluidly with each and every quest and contract, accompanied by amazing screenplays, that narrate the many story and side stories and in such a way that leaves you fiending for more. This game however is not without some weakness, and the most bleeding obvious when you play this game for more than a few hours is the feigning character enhancement upgrade system. As you spent points upgrading you character you do not get a sure feeling that the upgrade system is truly progressing you to a point where there is a discernible edge in battle upon augmenting many of Gerald's abilities. Death march is a mode that many non-completionists may want to avoid as it is a gruelling game mode and takes away a lot of the real nitty gritty fun in playing the Witcher 3. This Death march mode should only be attempted by those hell bent on achievements completion as this mode is very avoidable and not entertaining in the slightest way possible. The game is not without its inherent share of problems as well, as is common with many of the type of games, especially given the shear size of this game a lot of the bugging issues are to be expected. Overall this game is Well worth the time and effort spent playing it and the game itself sets a benchmark that has raised the standards of roll playing games that a lot of other game developers will struggle to equalise or surpass in the future.",9,2015-06-14,XBOX ONE,user
Daelus,"Given the number of noobs that point to Metacritic as some bible of objectivity instead of the center of the fanboy universe it is I feel obliged to weigh in. The number of 10/10 this game gets is nauseating and that so many came before the fanboys actually even played it should be a hint to anyone with integrity. OK, my thoughts on this game actually fairly well mirror the review by True Achievements, however unlike that ""reviewer"" my rating and my review bear some connection to one another. Alas, such is this industry. Pros - The story, the story, the story - after the trainwreck I felt Witcher 2 was, I was very pleasantly surpirsed by this narrative. Witcher 2 catered to fans of the books and assumed you had some understanding of what was going on...cardinal sin. This game is very accessible and tells a great story with fully fleshed out characters. This is the SOLE reason I rate this game above a 6 (6 would be an average open world RPG to me)....fantastic job. Cons - my the list is ****, far too long for anyone to rate this game anything close to a 10 unless they are a fanboy or sellout. Movement is bad....really bad, very imprecise. You are constantly overshooting everything...whether it is running, jumping, swinging your sword, looting (my god the **** BAD. For a combat RPG that is astonishing. Witcher 2 combat was clunky, this is both clunky and very, very loose. The only amusing part in this mess was the fact that you can't fall off a mountain, you literally ski down **** matter the height, no matter the **** down **** forbid there is anything with a slope at the bottom as you are then caught in a halfpipe for 30 seconds before you can get control of the character. Worse movement in a AAA game I have seen in years. Inventory - hands down the worst inventory system I have ever **** for a game that invites you to loot every 3 feet that is a problem...which brings us to looting and crafting. **** guy is a Witcher and yet to survive economically we are invited to loot every piece of twine, candle, plant, empty bottle, cows milk, you come **** vast majority of it is absolutely worthless, but you have no way of knowing that as there is no JUNK spot in your **** just about everything is worth1 crown...save at that 1 store in Novigrad, god bless A joke and very, very amateur. Crafting - I love crafting in RPGs...LOVE IT....this feels like an add-on. No thought went into it; you can't customize anything; there is a diagram for everything and the needed components are 1% of the stuff you loot; and everything is in sets you find while treasure hunting...rubbish. The font....egads the font.....55 inch TV...needed to be sititng right in front of it to read **** you need to read a **** kink in my neck is still killing me. Sidequests - I get that we all like different stuff, but the praise I hear for these sidequests is boggling. Literally 90% of the sidequests see you ""holding down your Witcher powers"" to follow footsteps, follow scents, find chests, find hidden doors, etc....hour after hour of this **** as if in AC you need to hold down your eagle vision for 1/2 the **** the Witcher vision camera is just god awful. Bugs, bugs and more **** a game that was delayed for 9 months to fix the bugs.....just wow. My Unity experience at launch was better than **** they gave us a free **** fear though, we're getting 16 free **** beard looks **** I might have to play through another 100 hours after the next sword comes out....ridiculous gimmick.

Krushner,"This game has had such an effect on me that it has inspired me to create an account and write my first review on metacritic. It is so refreshing to come across a developer in this day and age of cheap commercialism we live in, who actually gives a stuff about the customers it provides for. Firstly, I would like to start by saying that I have been gaming for over 20 years, a mixture of PC and various consoles. I would describe myself as a hardcore and difficult to please gamer, I can spend 15 hours a day gaming if I get a day off work and from the wife. So it is not something I enter into lightly when I state that this game is RPG perfection. The story is immersive and draws you instantly. Never have I been so emotionally attached to fictional game characters and cared so much about choices which affect them. The depth, thought and passion here is evident, with humour, sadness, intrigue and progression all morphed into a experience like none other I have seen before. Side quests seem endless and are not just shallow errands but interesting sub plots that give the main story more flesh and meaning. The only downside I can see is of you are short on time for gaming, as I have put over 70 hours in so far and the majority of that has been spent on side quests and Gwent, the ridiculously addictive mini card game. Moving onto combat; simple, yet deep. Easy to learn, yet tactical and often challenging. The perfect balance is achieved here. Victories are rewarding and I find myself looking forward to combat events and savouring them as they come and go. The combination of signs, close combat and range offers variety and opportunity for experiment. I can only comment on the hardest difficulty setting which I have chosen for my first play through which is very challenging, yet it forces you to fight smart and to not rush through. Freedom of movement; something which was not present in the second witcher game but which they have nailed in every way. Hundreds of locations to discover and endless areas to explore. Chance meetings are common which in turn generate spontaneous events and quest lines. The interface and levelling up is simple and works really well with a tutorial menu which explains just about everything you need to know. After over 20 years of gaming I can honestly say this is possibly the best game I have ever played. And cd project red have proved themselves one of the best developers of our current times. They respond swiftly to small in game issues with patches and seem ever interested and receptive to fans views and concerns alike. When you compare them to the likes of ubisoft and EA who spew out the same game every year with a different name, CDPR are at the top of their game. And I just hope that they get the support and rewards they deserve so they can continue to show up the big profit only driven corporations who don't care about the customers, only lining their pockets.

metalinc,"I have been an avid gamer since my old Atari 2600. If it was made....I have likely played it. With that said this game is amazing. I have well over 150 hours into this game and the amount of depth is awe inspiring. The side quests do not feel like cut and paste typical RPG point a to point b...they are all created with a certain nuance to them. If I had to guess I would say teams were made up JUST for the side quests and kept seperate from the main story line people. Just when you think you are just about done with an area and have done all the quests and found all of the areas....more unlock. It is amazing. Also, every time I play no matter for how long I am taken back by the pure depth of color and attention to details in the scenery....from blowing leaves, flies, drips of water, storms, placement of the **** is all just ****.

I am the kind of gamer that does do some side quests, but usually skip over the mundane 'kill 5 of these' or 'fetch this and bring it back' quests, but with The Witcher 3 I feel compelled to complete EVERYTHING. Some of the side quests are as deep and meaningful as the main quest itself, and better yet almost everything you do, be it a main quest or a side quest, impacts the world around you.

Skyrim is a great rpg as well but this game stands alone on the next gen concoles and sets a very high standard for the future of value for gamers. If you do the secondary quests and take witcher contracts it fits the whole story perfectly, no adventure is a waste of time.

Closeremperor16,"First of all I would like to start this review by stating that A) That the fact the pc version looks better is irrelevant if your playing on Xbox one then you don’t have a world eating PC rig so all you need to know is that the game looks stunning! Moving on to B) For me the day one patch has fixed most frame rate issues, It has been very solid so far with no real notable slow down; and I have yet to loss a fight due to slowdown affecting timing or anything like that at all (30 hours in btw).....* UPDATE I am now 90 hours in and thought I should update you to say I am now 20% through the game and I have done a LOT of exploring ect. I'm still discovering new things to do and the game is still suprising me and feels very fresh, I have no inclination to stop any time soon! Also I changed my score from 9 to 10!* And C) BUY THIS GAME! If you like RPG’s then you owe it to yourself to at least check this out. A lot of people have talked about the vastness of the world(it’s huge) as well as the depth of writing and scripting for not only the main quest but side quests and random encounters (this is all true). For me the main reason I love this game over Dragon age inquisition is that it’s the first time since Skyrim that I felt like I was at the start **** adventure and that my wandering and exploring would actually lead to interesting things to do. When I played Skyrim I wanted to search every knock and cranny of the whole map because I was constantly tripping over interesting quest’s, hidden dungeons , high level monsters and being rewarded with mountains of loot! That’s how this game feels, I have spent over 10 hours or so just wandering the map finding random encounters looking for loot and generally enjoying a bevy of diverse well conceived and entertaining content. Whether it be exploring a sunken ship wreck to recover a powerful sword or destroying monster nest’s and helping traveller’s on the road. All of this is before you even start on the actual proper side quest and witcher contracts of which there are many! and nearly all of them have interesting plots and characters for you to immerse yourself in. Then you have the fact that you’re choice have consequences that you wont always see coming and the dark morally grey nature of the world around you means choices wont always be easy or obvious. Plus the combat is deep and relies on timing, strategy and preparation as well as a very deep intuitive crafting and alchemy system and my god if it isn’t Skyrim all over again! (Goodbye Sunlight Ill see you in about 200 hours time). So summing up I love this game! It’s tough but rewarding, you are free to explore and discover things for yourself but without sacrificing story and good writing and there are no copy and paste missions at all. For me DA:I was a huge disappointment, sure some people love it and there’s nothing wrong with that, it isn’t a terrible game by any means; But it is flawed and I constantly felt like the game was just big for the sake of being big. Outside of the main story (which was great by the way) everything else to do in the world was basically just filler and it felt like filler. A couple of one line quest’s like “ I have lost a ring can you find it” find ring and return “ thanks” is fine but when nearly every side quest is no more complicated then that and everything else to do is rinse and repeat like , build a camp, destroy a portal! You quickly (or I did ) start to feel like your Playing a traditional RPG stretched at the seams and stuffed with Filler to be a big open world! The fact that you are forced to do all this boring filler stuff in order to progress the actually quite good story is infuriating and the whole thing ended up feeling shallow and lazy. The reason I have gone in to DA:I so much is The Witcher is the Exact opposite of that, it’s deep and diverse it has so much engaging and interesting content that it can be a bit overwhelming and it is generally stunning to look at with beautiful lighting shadows and particle effect that blow Dragon age away. A lot of people like Dragon age and a lot of effort went in to it which should be appreciated but 30 hours in I had lost all motivation to continue playing whereas the same distance in to Witcher 3 I literally can not stop playing. Say what you will it’s all personal preference but for me The watcher is the best designed, best looking RPG since Skyrim(and it obv looks better) It’s brimming with personality and is a time sink of the very best variety!",10,2015-06-03,XBOX ONE,user

ahussainn98,The game is awesome. I've got about 7 hours in it. Great graphics. Great game play.

rodericrinehart,"SCORE: 99/100 The hype was worth it, and more. A morally grey world with the best quests ever made in a game. It is officially the best video game I have ever played in my life. It will stick with me forever. The best story I've ever seen in a game and it rivals even Lord of the Rings for books and movies. It has amazing graphics, and continues to impress as you crank it to 1600p and ultra everything. The most innovative and intriguing thing about the game is that decisions you make matter (without a simple good/evil bar), and often you will not know the extent of your decisions for hours or even tens of hours (none of this ""so and so will remember that"" from Telltale games and none of the simple and obvious good/bad choices of almost every other game ever. It also has fantastic setting and lore, which pays lots of fan service to Witcher 2 fans (like me) but is absolutely accessible to people who never played either other game (like my wife). Finally, it is just plain ridiculously fun and never got old even after 135 hours. Yes, it is a bit clunky to control (but only out of combat), the swimming is atrociously bad, the inventory cannot be sorted, and some other minor issues as well. But when you absolutely nail every other part of your game, it just doesn't matter.",10,2015-06-01,XBOX ONE,user
osprey,"This is my fourth and final review of this game. I have sunk at least one hundred hours into this game so far and haven't enjoyed any of it. There are many reasons for this . Firstly after all the hype and delay the game arrived broken and unfinished. The load times are endless and break the players immersion into the game. The choices make me feel manipulated and I don't feel I really have any choice at all. I am just being forced into doing what is required for the story as you have written it. I really dislike the music and there is very little mood or atmosphere created by it. I honestly don't feel invested in any way and this makes me very sad. The avalanche of 10s this game is getting is a mystery to me. I still don't know if I can finish this game because I am not getting any reward for my efforts, it all seems so meaningless. I like RPG games as a rule and I love traveling by horseback but non of this is making this game fun for me. This is the last Witcher game for me and for sure the last time I fall for the hype.",3,2015-06-01,XBOX ONE,user
geo3rdrow,"I love this game.. I don't even know where to start. To give you an idea of what you're playing take shadows of mordor and mix it with elder scrolls. It's wonderful. Skyrim is my all time favorite game and The Witcher 3 is trying to nudge it to the side. Simply put, I've never played a game where I just don't even care if I get anything done at all!! most games I'm trying to rush here, rush there, get this.. The Witcher just makes me want to go through the game slowly and enjoy every part, including just riding my horse to random locations or playing a game of gwent with a random person I find. I seriously love this game... It feels like you are actually part of the world, CONSTANTLY making decisions that effect EVERYTHING. I haven't found a single mission that bores me yet and I've had the game since it released. Even the fact that once you craft a potion once all you need to do is meditate and the damn potion comes back makes the game so much more enjoyable. No running around spending hours searching for stupid plants everytime you need to refill a potion. I chose this game over Eldar Scrolls Online simply because I am getting older now with less and less time on my hands and I simply can't compete with younger gamers anymore. I don't come home looking forward to grinding out for hours and hours and hours every night because I simply don't have the time and I also just don't care enough. Single player is what made Skyrim so fantastic, and again the same reason why I love this game. I don't want to be dealing with other players, I just want to be in my own fantasy at my own pace. Seriously love this game, right up there with Skyrim. Only bad is the graphics aren't the greatest on the xbox 1 or ps4 from what I've seen. That means so little however that I'm still giving this game a mother******* 10!!! love it",10,2015-06-01,XBOX ONE,user

SuperkenGaming,"The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt Beautiful, but broken. The Witcher 3 starts out perfect You’re introduced to a massive would where massive creatures roam and make their claims on territories. There’s a sense of fear and challenge in this aspect alone. As you travel the land of white orchard you hear people call out for help and you stop to speak with them and help them with their problems for some coin. Even the tiniest thing such as helping an old woman get her frying pan back feels immersive and draws you into the world. This is where you’re introduced to the idea of oils and potions, finding enemies weaknesses, using your witcher senses to find clue about what youre about to face, and preparing for fights, something that comes in handy for harder difficulties. I feel like this was the vision. White Orchard would be what the witcher 3 was all about, and then the game kinda just falls apart and its vision fades. The witcher tells a beautiful story of urgency, and for that reason alone, the side quests and question marks that clutter the map in velen and other locations make no sense to exist in the context of the games story. Geralt needs to get to the bottom of what happened, why would he waste his time with the problems of randoms and destroying monster nests. There are some great side quests that actually tie in to the story, and they are beautiful and fun quests but the ones there just to attempt and make the world feel alive ultimately feel like pointless grinding. Many times I found myself just skipping through the cut scenes of these quests. This could have been fixed with incentive more than coin, such as weapons and armors like treasure hunts offer. The witcher contracts should have been mandatory obstacles in your way of story progression. These type of things make sense in a Skyrim type game where you write your own story, but in the witcher 3, the story is already established... you aren’t an adventurer. You’re a rescuer. But as a rescuer there is tons to do to level up so you can take on the challenges that await you. Again contracts and sidequests could have used this idea for benefit, making them feel like training instead of just a job. You can set out in the world to clear up abandoned sites to repopulate them, you can go out to take down beasts terrorizing territories or just go out and fight random creatures blocking your way to a new undiscovered location. And the combat is satisfying, so fighting enemies never feels like a drag. You can block, parry, roll, dodge, heavy attack, fast attack, shoot at them with arrows, use any of the magic signs to shoot fire from your fingers, use a protective spell, magic traps, knock enemies back, control their minds, so much opportunity and combos that can be played with. And while defeating creatures doesn’t grant much xp, they are still worth the fight as enemies drop items for upgrades, crafting, and alchemy. The crafting in this game really is some of the best I’ve seen. You can dismantle objects for items you need to craft base items for main items, it may feel overwhelming at first, but once you really dive in, it’s clever and worthwhile to figure out. You can purchase items from shops and alchemists or you can explore the beautiful world that The Witcher 3 offers. When you do level up, you can use the skill points in a vast skill tree and choose the perks you want to use, with up to 12 free slots for these perks. This skill tree can be wrapped around your personal play style or the style you need to take down a specific enemy as there are potions to reset your perks so you can respend them. I’m a very aggressive player so I for the most part focused on combat skills rather than alchemy or magic. There are also races you can do, but your horse annoyingly gets caught up on nothing and will randomly just stop which can lead to frustration. And now my favorite part of the game. Gwent. Gwent is a mini game within the game and im not ashamed to say that I liked gwent more than witcher 3 itself. Gwent is a very addictive game with massive marketing potential, so get to making the app CD Projekt red. Now for the bad, for starters leveling up in the witcher 3 is a complete drag, not only does it feel unsatisfying to slay hordes of creatures, the games design actually discourages it. If you dare level grind like you’re supposed to in an rpg rather than stick to the main story, you’re punished for it by earning 0xp if you’re 6 levels or more above the suggested level for that mission. Not only does it discourage you from going on your own wild hunt, but it makes you look at side quests and blow them off, why waste your time and effort? The game also has many stability issues I lost count of the game crashes at 10, this was only in my first few days of playing the game, with and without game patches. The Witcher 3 makes the mistake of not constantly saving when you stumble on new locations or accomplish something tiny like a gwent win, causing you to have to re-do 10-30 minutes if the game crashes, gwent cards being random for wins adds salt to the wounds, as if the game crashes after a win, you’ll more than likely not get that card again that you were so excited to win. I also ran into head floating glitches that really just destroyed the world and its immersion, and there was absolutely no polish or attention to detail put into cut scenes where it should be most. Sure I expect items to ghost through objects in game, but in cut scene, it’s unacceptable. Not only are there game crashing bugs in this massive open world, but there are missables which is complete bs. Making a 200 hour long game and putting content in there such as side quests and collectibles and making them missable if you don’t drop the world to do them now is massively disrespectful to players and their time. At the very least put asterisk around missable quests so we know to prioritize them, so we don’t get lost in your story, heaven forbid…and have to replay a 200 hour game again to see content we feel robbed of, or better yet don’t make them missable at all, which leads me to achievements and more bs. The witcher 3 is all about choices, that being said it’s shady as heck to put in achievements that force you to make certain decisions, really lessoning the games experience having to try to spin a web around a mid-game ding. I know you don’t have to trophy hunt, , but that isn’t an excuse to disrespect a players experience by forcing those that do trophy hunt to play by your rules… that contradicts the entire premise of the witcher 3 as a game. While I was massively impressed by my first 10 hours of the witcher 3, there are too many flaws in game design for me to overlook. But that doesn’t take away from the fact that this is a gorgeous and intensely immerse game with thought provoking story telling, over 30 different endings you can get and hundreds of hours of content. For what it is. Action RPG – 9/10 Overall 9/10",9,2015-06-01,XBOX ONE,user
Kenmei,"A wonderful 3rd person Action RPG that is almost ruined entirely by the numerous bugs present in the game, The Witcher 3, once all the bugs are fixed, will easily go down as one of the best games of the year. Not to say that it's perfect. For all the wonderful things it does, it also tends to do some weird things. The controls for certain parts of the game (most notably the swimming and climbing controls) are absolute rubbish. And the story takes so long to get going that the ending will surprise most people cause it kinda comes out of nowhere after the slow pacing the rest of the game had. However the biggest problem are the bugs, especially on the X1. I have never seen a single-player game have so many game crippling bugs in my life. From Save bugs to slow down to cutscenes not loading properly to the game just not wanting to move forward when you hit certain points of the quest, there are so many problems that I cannot in good faith recommend this to anyone right now. Once those are fixed this certainly is a wonderful experience but the bugs and freezes have to be taken into account and, in that regard, The Witcher 3 is a massive failure. Once patches are released to fix all the problems, I'd wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who enjoys these types of games. Till then I'd only recommend it to the ones willing to put with at least 1 freeze every 4 gaming hours and possibly losing your saves in the process.",8,2015-06-01,XBOX ONE,user

opSTOOmus,"I was really looking forward to this game but unfortunately it has fell to the same problem that A LOT of releases are subject to currently, it is simply NOT FINISHED! The reason why I have given this 5 is because there are just as many things I like about the game as there are things that I hate about the game. I'll start with things I like about the game. It is huge, simply massive, there is so much story and side quests, this game will keep you going for hours. It also looks amazing, the graphics are stunning and the landscape just looks incredible. its also a very interesting landscape too as there are lots of really nice features to it scattered all over the place. The control system is nice and simple so it is very easy to get into. Things I really dislike, the game glitches and clips all over the place, I don't think the voice lip syncing is quite accomplished, the frame rate slows down every so often really badly as well. It bugs me a bit that you automatically run everywhere unless you half push the control stick, you have a horse that follows you every where so I think the defeats the need for this. The writing on screen is WAY too small, I have to get out my seat to go and read what it says and I wear glasses that are fully fine for my eyes. Finally, I don't like the health system, its really hard to come across food to replenish your health, I find myself half dead and looking for food most of the time. Now i will admit I have not finished the game, I am not even that far into it but these things bugging me are really influencing this from happening. i will solider on towards the end but I am less motivated to do that at the minute. I will adjust my score accordingly if I find it better later on. I can see what people do like about this game but I really can't forgive any developer for half finishing a game. Everything that gets released by Nintendo never has glitches or problems so why is it acceptable for any other developer to do it. It happens with too much now because it seems ok to just ping patches out at a later date. If i buy a meal at a restaurant, i don't expect half of it to come out with promise of the rest being posted to e bit by bit at a later date, so why is this ok? We will see how this picks up but for now it gets a solid 5.",5,2015-05-31,XBOX ONE,user
hzding621,"Excellent game for great storyline, character, graphics and music. A much better experience in combat system than skyrim. Geralt is an existing character with his own character history, which is different from games in which you create your character from ground up - which IMO results in a better story-telling, but it might depend on whether you like the character setting. There was a serious bug involved with infinite loading in initial release, which significantly affected game experience, hence an 8 out 10. Some other minor problems.",8,2015-05-29,XBOX ONE,user
Nataraja,"TL In short, CD Projekt Red has crafted one of the finest RPGs ever made. This is a classic and surpasses its predecessors in almost every way. Incredible graphics, fantastic sound, remarkable soundtrack and great story telling. The AI, however, can be easily exploited in sections and some side quests and even main quest have some real issues. Looting is frustrating until you get used to the incredibly narrow loot range and direction - was done to allow for looting in combat but it also makes looting a chore when not in combat. There are some glaring clipping issues and sound overlay problems but that is to be expected in a game that provides well over 100 hours of game play. Combat difficulty is extremely varied and its easy to out level the main quest content if you do a significant number of side quests so be cautious if you enjoy a challenge. I recommend this game highly to anyone that enjoys RPGs, despite some of the **** minor issues. This is a game that will stay with you for a long time and is a fitting closure to Geralt of Rivia's tale. GRAPHICS: The graphics are spectacular but demanding on the PC. You do need to have a substantial rig to fully enjoy the graphical fidelity. On console the graphics are well executed and meet the ""next gen"" standard. SOUND: Really well done ambient, combat and location sound effects that create a very compelling atmosphere. However there are some sound bugs where certain effects will linger and over power dialogue which is annoying and immersion breaking. SOUNDTRACK: The soundtrack is phenomenal and very fitting to the setting, well implemented and strikes a chord at the right moments with excellent fading and transition some exceptions where, like the ambient sound effects, the music is overly loud and will interfere with dialogue delivery. VOICE ACTING: Superb voice acting, with good dialogue and consistently well delivered lines. The NPC dialogues in areas could use a bit more variety perhaps as it can become monotonous and even irritating to hear certain dialogues over and over. STORY: Excellent stories and very compelling, rich character development using multiple story telling devices including cut scenes, descriptions, items and game play. One of the best stories in gaming. GAME PLAY: The combat is varied, from easy to difficult and is usually dependent on preparation and build but the AI can have issues at times. Otherwise the combat is fun and is adjustable to play style ranging from light armored dodging, fast attacks and signs to heavy armored tanking and the middle path of a little of both. The limitation on healing allows for tension and precision and can be challenging. Crafting is well implemented and can play a vital part in the game. Gwent, the mini card game is really quite fun but can be completely ignored if you don't enjoy it. GAME DESIGN: Great level design and a vast open world to explore. Secret passages, caches, and unusual ruins compel the player to explore. The exploration is also well rewarded with great story telling and really well developed characters outside of the main quest. The quest design is some of the best since the Secret World and many developers should take note of the quest design in this game as it sets the bar very high for the genre and for games in general. Even after completing the main story the remaining quests, even the ones that are low level, are enticing just for the stories that they tell. RECOMMENDATION: If you enjoy RPGs and well told stories this game is a must purchase.",9,2015-05-29,XBOX ONE,user

Nimzabaat,The Witcher 3 is an excellent game that still has a few issues. The main issue is pacing. This game is much larger than Skyrim or Dragon Age Inquisition with far less to do than either of those games. You'll really need to use your horse in this game because playable content is really far apart. There is also a problem with level scaling. In the beginning you'll have a hard time finding content of an appropriate level. This means you'll probably spend many hours just looking for something to do. Other than that the games quests are memorable and the graphics (numerous glitches aside) are spectacular.,7,2015-05-27,XBOX ONE,user
Allthegoodones,"Really wantdd to give this a higher score but the witcher 2 set the bar so damn high that, despite all the bells and whistles, the witcher 3 falls short of my expectations. Its gorgeous and gargantuan, granted, but its also somewhat bland and blasé. The feeling of adventure and, in fact, endeavor that the last iteration invoked is somehow missing. The witcher 2 grabbed you by the scruff of the neck from the get go and shoved you into the action right away and you had such a hard time catching your breath that when you did find those few moments of reprieve, they felt well earned and rewarding. None of that holds true for the witcher 3 and the over all experience is more cumbersome than captivating. A huge part of what undermines the experience is the horribly ported inventory management system. It is clearly designed for a mouse and keyboard interface and no effort has been made to mold it for a user friendly console experience. Its so cluttered and ill organized that i dread getting new loot because of the time i will have to waste in locating it and assessing it. Add to that the maddeningly small font eveywhere in the game and its easy to see that the console version was not a priority for the developers. This is super disappointing considering what a marvelous job had been done with the witcher 2 port. It was easily the best RPG on the x360 and I had hoped history would repeat itself but no such luck! Luckily, these issues can be easily patched and once they are i might revisit this review because i want to love this game and i know that under the skin this is a great game but as it stands rights now, its a 6/10 game with an added point for the free dlc being offered by CD PROJECT RED and the carry over love for the witcher 2. Fixing the superficial stuff could raise it to an 8 to 8.5 game but its never going to be as ground breaking, breath taking and unforgettable as the witcher 2.",7,2015-05-26,XBOX ONE,user

Tylaris,"I've been playing rpg's for more than 20 years and, until now, I've never been one to put any above others as a ""king"" of it's genre. But the sheer scope, atention to detail and how well it combines exploration, storytelling and it's own style of gameplay, warrants Witcher 3 that title. It's Story, characters, dialogue, quest/world/creature design are second to none of this genre. The world design can only be described as the most immersive, belieavable ecosystem ever crafted in any video game with an art style and atmosphere that perfectly captures architecture of mid european cities/village communities of it's historical time. Graphics,voice acting and music are of the highest quality. Gameplay is vastly improved from previous **** is still not as responsive as Bloodborne or has the same quality of animations such Arkham series, however it more than makes up for it with an amazing variety of creatures and different types of AI, preparation through alchemy, learning your foes' weaknesses through extensive bestiary, use of magic signs that you can also use on your environment to give you advantage, as well as other tools at your disposal such as bombs, crossbow etc. It is not without rough spots though...such as UI( Inventory system), AI ( horse riding), controls and camera as well as suffering from no small number of bugs/glitches. Honestly, until CDPR takes care of these things, I would give it a 9...however I'm rating it a bit higher to negate childish stupidity of those who downvote this game because they feel threatened by any game that surpasses their favorite title. This is not merely another great ****'s place lies next to titles such as Chronotrigger, Half Life, Morrowind and others...games that mark a generation and leave higher standards for others to follow.",10,2015-05-26,XBOX ONE,user
Hashsnob,"First off, don't listen to the children complaining about clunky movement, they are bad at video games. They need an automated fight system like ez mode assassins creed or else ""its clunky"", no you little ****, its just not easy, witcher 3 combat is challenging on purpose, and you **** at it. Besides that, the graphics are fantastic, especially the lighting effects. I've seen people on here say dragon age looked better.... that is a lie, dragon age lacks the environmental detail of witcher, if something in dragon age looks better, its because they are ignoring all other visuals in order to focus on one single element. The games amazing graphics and challenging combat system aside, you will easily spend 100+ hours enjoying this game, I am currently at 49 hours played with 7% of the game completed according to xbox. You will find the side quests feel as meaningful and part of the story as the main ones, and that they are highly rewarding. What else is rewarding is exploring. Exploring the map and the objects in it give you new patterns, weapons/armor, and even talent/skill points to make your character stronger, so you will highly benefit from playing the game freely versus sticking to the story line. And lastly the game has boobies, so that's always a plus, I can't remember the last time I played a AAA title with XXX sex scenes.",10,2015-05-26,XBOX ONE,user
ellimar188,"Before sharing my thoughts on CD Projekt Red’s “The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt” I just want to note two things. First, I am currently running into the Xbox One save bug that has been plaguing a lot of other players. However, while this is extremely annoying, I will not be factoring the bug into my impressions of the game. Just a friendly warning to anyone planning on playing on the Xbox! Second, this review is more of a first impression, as I am still at the beginning of the game (10-15 hours in). My thoughts on “The Witcher 3” may very well change when I finally complete the game’s story. That being said, I am having an absolutely amazing time! “The Witcher 3” is not a game; it is an interactive experience. CD Projekt Red has managed to engross me in a way that few developers have. Everything is top notch! The characters, combat, narrative, and the world itself all make “The Witcher 3” a great adventure worthy of your time and money. The characters in “The Witcher 3” are all well written, something that I think is lacking in a lot of recent AAA games. Dialogue is believable and engrossing. Further, CD Projekt gives you just the right amount of control over Geralt’s responses. You are able to shape his actions as you see fit, but the White Wolf’s personality still comes across. I think that the game benefits from focusing on Geralt instead of letting players create a character, as is customary with most RPGs. I love how the inhabitants of war ravaged Temeria react to me as I roam the land searching for monsters to slay or my next quest location: taking on the role of Geralt makes me feel as though I am truly apart of the world. Playing as Geralt’s ward, Ciri, is also a lot of fun (though not nearly as engaging). Moreover, the narrative itself is very, very interesting thus far. Combat is a lot of fun. While it took me a bit of getting used too, fighting monsters is a smooth, deadly dance. I love diving to the side of oncoming attacks, springing up, and then using the igni sign (a fire spell) to light my enemies ablaze! Everything flows fairly well, though I occasionally have trouble with the targeting system. The game’s emphasis on preparation before combat is also interesting and enjoyable. Knowing your enemy’s weaknesses and preparing the right potions, using the correct signs, and applying the correct oil to your blade really pays off. However, you can also turn the difficulty down and enjoy fast paced, zero preparation combat if that suits you! The world itself looks beautiful, despite the graphical downgrades from the PC version. Characters look realistic and are well animated, while the environments in which you travel are detailed and vibrant. Exploring in “The Witcher 3” actually feels like stepping foot into another world! CD Projekt does an excellent job building the world in which you explore. From the comments of peasants as you walk or ride by to the many interesting side quests (which are all well-written and engrossing, unlike MMO-style fetch or grind quests), my time in “The Witcher 3” has been extremely engaging. I do have some minor gripes. I find riding Geralt’s horse to be a bit annoying due to slightly unresponsive controls, while the game’s inventory text is a bit small.

mokamig,"Muchos años esperando este juego hasta que por fin pude tener en mis manos la Edición Coleccionista -un regalo de mi novia- y solo puedo decir que me ha fascinado en todos sus aspectos. La verdad no tengo muchas palabras para definir lo que me causo este juego, solo sentimientos con grandes recuerdos de los libros, de mis favoritos para siempre. Empezamos por la parte grafica que para mí es excelente, tiene muchos lugares diversos y llenos de vida, en los cuales me perdí por muchas horas por ejemplo Novigrado es una ciudad muy bellamente diseñada me quede mucho tiempo en ella, también el modelado de personajes para ser un sandbox está muy bien conseguido. Puestas de sol increíbles, anochecer hermoso y sistema climático muy bueno. En el apartado de sonido es increíble, los encargados del audio junto con Percival hicieron un gran trabajo, música que acompaña cada momento y en ocasiones que solo me quedaba escuchando la melodía, una banda sonora épica. La historia es grandiosa y ese montón de guiños a los libros y personajes de juegos anteriores me dan una gran alegría. Ver a Yen y Ciri -que es de mis personajes literarios favoritos, la vi crecer y evolucionar durante los libros- simplemente me causó una emoción indescriptible. La toma de decisiones es demasiado genial, muchas que tomar durante la aventura y personas que a veces crees que ayudas pero no lo es así, este mundo creado por Andrzej Sapkowski es muy gris, no todo es lo que parece, no hay un bien o mal a veces bien definido, es algo que me encanto en los libros y aquí se plasma muy bien. En el apartado de misiones todas las principales están geniales y las secundarias igual, aunque algunas más simples que otras pero la mayoría muy bien hechas y con sus propias mini historias, que a veces involucran menciones a los mismos libros o personas de los otros juegos. La caza se monstruos es el punto fuerte, hay que averiguar sus debilidades y estudiarlos muy bien para poderles hacer frente, en niveles de dificultad altos hay que planificar todo muy bien, me sentí como un verdadero brujo. En el apartado jugable también me encanta muchísimo, es una evolución de lo que vimos en The Witcher 2 pero mucho más ágil y en el nivel mas alto hay que ser muy cauteloso y saber utilizar muy bien las señales de brujo. Las diferentes armaduras y armas nos dan ventajas pero también desventajas ante ciertos rivales. El uso de pociones y aceites esta genial y hay que saber bien como y cuales aplicar para hacer una pelea bastante equilibrada con algún rival fuerte o monstruo. CD Projekt ha querido calcar mucho ese baile que hacen los brujos al pelear según lo descrito en los libros y lo hace muy bien. Obviamente no hay juego perfecto, tiene algunos pequeños errores gráficos y otros en el combate, uno que otro bug menor pero en sí nada que haya afectado mi experiencia de juego pero es parte de hacer este mundo tan grande pero tan bien detallado, no hay juego perfecto pero si juegos hechos excelentemente bien y con amor. Los minijuegos muy bien implementados, Sardinilla a veces se controla un poco extraño pero en términos generales cumple, las cartas me pareció un juego muy divertido y los puños algo parecido a lo que era en The Witcher 2. El sistema de navegación está bastante bien y para mi es bastante entretenido navegar por ratos. En definitiva es una saga que amo muchísimo me ha dado grandes momentos desde que tuve la oportunidad de leerme todos los libros y empezar a jugar The Witcher 1 fue una experiencia sublime, ver como muchos de los personas que leí cobraban vida en un medio como este es magistral. The Witcher 2 también me encanto en todo y este que analizamos, obviamente desde una perspectiva totalmente subjetiva es uno de los mejores juegos que he jugado y de los mejores juegos de rol en mi top. Nada mejor que un estudio lleve una de tus obras favoritas de la literatura a un videojuego y mas que sea épicamente en tu genero favorito que es el rol. Vamos a esperar con muchas ganas la expansiones, ojala traigan mucho contenido. Muchas Gracias Andrzej Sapkowski por crear tan hermoso pero real mundo literario, con personajes carismáticos y temas de muchas importancia en el ámbito social, económico, filosófico y Muchas Gracias CD Projekt por llevarlo y ampliarlo de una manera tan magistral a los videojuegos. Te has retirado de la mejor manera mi gran amigo Geralt de Rivia. Hasta Siempre.",10,2015-05-25,XBOX ONE,user

keitaro202,"This game is very difficult to rate mainly because you have so many people not truly understanding what the game is. So I'll try spelling it out **** you can be the judge. Many people hear ""open-world"" and then immediately equate it with ""sandboxing."" These poor individuals think that an open world is successful only insofar as it is successful as a sandbox. Well....this is asinine. Given this... I'm going to tell this now: Witcher 3 is NOT a sandbox. Open-world DOES NOT mean sandbox either. Some games, like Skyrim (to use the example so many people like to use as comparison) is a sandbox game without any narrative punch. You DO NOT play Skyrim to get a meaningful narrative with rich story telling and dynamic quests. You play Skyrim to mess around in an open world and do random things...nothing more. The Witcher is not that. If you want **** play Skyrim. The Witcher has story telling elements akin to The Last of Us, Bioshock, **** just so happens to take place in an open world. But ""sandboxing,"" traditionally conceived, is not its focus. Witcher proves that an open world game can have the depth of a linear story heavy game. If you want a game that pulls at your heart strings, makes you emotionally react to the decisions you **** you want a game that presents to you meaningful and impactful choices...then Witcher is for you. Given that the Witcher's main goal is to present you to a dynamic world fraught with **** has succeeded...greatly.",10,2015-05-25,XBOX ONE,user

ZekeMania,"CONTROLS. ARE. CLUNKY. If you take Witcher 3 as a narrative interactive experience it should easily be in the 8-10 range for you. Returning players to the series were quick to give it a ""10"" because Witcher 3 has most certainly delivered in this category. I am in agreement with them. But as a newcomer to the series I can't give the game anything higher than 7/10 because the controls have been breaking my level of immersion every step of the way. Combat is more of the same, and after 15 hours I have really lost interest in getting any better at combat and have dropped the difficulty level indefinitely. Really a shame because the amount of content in this game is staggering. BOTTOM LINE- Don't miss out on this game and try not to let it's shortcomings hurt your experience. I will play Witcher 3 all the way out because these days you rarely see this much value in a game at launch.",7,2015-05-24,XBOX ONE,user
crus8dr,"I am a returning player from both the Witcher and Witcher 2, so I had high expectations for this game. For those who just want a ""should I buy/not buy"" review, I heartily recommend buying, IF you played either of the others and enjoyed the story/gameplay. There is a still a lot here for a newcomer to the series as well, and the game does an excellent job catching new players up on the major details. As I said, I had high expectations for this game, and CD ProjektRed has not disappointed. This is easily the best Witcher entry yet. The story is deeper, the enemies are more varied in type and personality, the alliances you forge are more tenuous, and the entire game has a much darker, gritty feel than both previous games. Pros: Voice acting is absolutely outstanding (and varied!), graphics are reasonable (PC is no doubt much better), gameplay and controls are easier to learn than previous Witchers, and the world is much, much larger. Cons: Only two that I have encountered so far. 1) Combat and movement are a bit clunky/sluggish. I acknowledge this may be a personal issue though, and other players may feel differently. 2) A couple of quests have been completed and won't disappear from my questbook, though I did receive rewards for them and they are double-listed in the completed quest log. So only the completionist in me is crying out for satisfaction and there is no practical effect on the game (unlike other RPGs I could point to...I'm looking at you Skyrim). These two admittedly minor issues are the only reason I knocked off a point from my score, and if these get fixed in a later patch, I will be back here to adjust my scoring to a full 10. TL:DR Version: Great game, awesome story, and well worth the wait for die-hard Witcher fans. Even something here for newbros. Very minor issues, but nothing that is game-breaking or more than a minor annoyance. 9/10",9,2015-05-24,XBOX ONE,user
jaymclain,"I have mixed opinions about this game...overall, the visuals and story are great. I like that the side quests aren't simple meaningless fetch quests, but weave nicely into the very engaging main story. The characters are very well developed throughout the early parts of the game. However, the controls are clunky and some major aspects of the game are overly difficult to control -- like horse riding and combat. The controls felt cumbersome and awkward. Frequently the frame rate drops are noticeable, particularly surprising to someone who doesn't normally care about such things. The game music is uninspiring, and frankly I didn't even notice it during any of the gameplay (unlike a game like Assasins Creed, for example, where the music adds greatly to many moments in the game). The main issue for me are the bugs related to game saving. I lost 5+ hrs of gameplay that I would really rather not perform over again. Very frustrating. I am going to set this game aside for a month or two and see how CD Projekt Red responds. I won't be pre-ordering any of ""red's"" games in the future.",7,2015-05-23,XBOX ONE,user
MANDIRIGMA,"Phenomenal. Just phenomenal. Graphics are stunningly beautiful. I have just played 23 hrs and the story is very compelling. Even the side quests are interesting and I like how some of them have stories tied together. It doesn't feel like I am just fetching things. Geralt is the baddest, enough said. Just a couple of issues is that the movement is a little bit clumsy at times and there is a saving game bug but I heard it will get rectified with a patch next week. By far the best RPG I have played. I daresay better than skyrim and DAI. Kudos CD Projekt for a well-constructed and well-thought game. You deserve money.",10,2015-05-23,XBOX ONE,user

trooper1993,"Realistically this game can be considered the only game that has met it's hype this year. Unlike many other releases this game has a flair for keeping the user engaged and willing to continue playing much like Skyrim did years ago. Although The Witcher 3 and Skyrim are essentially complete different games they both share two crucial aspects that enforce a genuine form of commitment on the user; The gorgeous landscape within the open-world arena and the intriguing storyline characterised by rich dialogue and well-developed characters. These two features have the ability to successfully involve a much wider clientele of gamers that normally avoid Role-playing games. However, this game has some flaws which cause it to run short from a perfect 10. On a graphical point of view this game doesn't really impress on consoles. Although on PC it's a complete different story it is a little bit frustrating that a game like this cannot perform equally on these ""next-gen"" consoles. Furthermore, the combat system although pleasant and functional has a tendency to be inconsistent and difficult to follow. Hopefully a patch can resolve these issues as it would increase the pleasure of playing this game even more.",7,2015-05-22,XBOX ONE,user

Rysingzombie,"In my opinion Witcher 3 is one of those games that every Xbox one owner (heck every gamer) should have in their library. It has something for everyone. Even if you aren't big on magic, the sword play combat is pretty darn fun. Even if you aren't huge on RPGs the world, as people are mentioning, is alive and it begs to be explored. I have been so amazed by the weather, the night and day cycle, the beard growth of Geralt, and all the minor details that **** you in. This game is truly immersive with incredible graphics, outstanding voice acting, fun and rewarding gameplay, and it has an engrossing story. If you consider **** you owe it to yourself to pick this up!

akraje47,"Everything in this game is solid. Graphics solid and beauty at: PC - One - PS4. The world: At all platforms smooth and so alive, this game really brings you to world of Geralt. The climate changes, and you can fell it, its like when in real life you feel the wind, the clouds closing the sun, and you know its gonna rain. In TW3 you know that without even looking to sky, just because of animals, the foliage, the wind... Gorgeous. RPG: This is an action rpg right? Yes, but its so rich, potions, alchemy, magic, swords, shields, bow, xbox, they're not simple weapons to use, they're something else, they defines you, you cant just simple use them, you need to master it, enjoy and understand each weapon. The level, the customization is everything in this game, you cant simply add ability points, you need to link that with your combat style, with your way to play, with your way of live in this world. Books, stories. Imagine a Skyrim with more dense and fluid combat system, add an alive world that changes all times by your actions and decisions, now, you're only 10% of what TW3 is capable. Quests: They dont exist only to you level up, gear up, or end the story... They exist to make this world alive, i hate sidequests, but here you cant ignore them, they're as rich as the main ones. This game defines next-gen RPG. Actors/NPC: Facial expressions, finest voice action, fluid smooth, you imagine the NPC is really there, is not just something to tell you the story, they're alive in this world. Mine final opinion: This a must for an action gamer, a must for an rpg gamer, a must for FPS gamer, a must for everyone. This game change it all, to me it enter the same revolution as: Chrono trigger, First Doom, Final Fantasy 7, Half-life... This is the new level of future rpg, cant imagine if is even possible to match with it.

QbaPolak17,"This game is simply a masterpiece. It is now my favorite video game of all time, and I can explain exactly why. As a fan of plot-centric and story driven games, I was always drawn to the witcher franchise, but similar to the problems I had with naughty dogs Uncharted games was that I felt that the linear structure, though it did sometimes added cohesion, was often quite detrimental to player immersion, as the levels are all walled off, and you feel constrained. This is why games like Red Dead Redemption and Skyrim, or better yet Morrowind, left such an impression. The connection that the open world nature of the game grants you is insurmountable in any linear adventure. So though I loved the other witcher games, i couldn't give them a perfect score. This however I can without question. It has the best story I had the pleasure of playing, some of the best and smoothest combat, and the deepest lore in an RPG I have ever experienced. For people new to the series or who just want a comparison to other AAA releases, imagine a mash up of Skyrim's world, Red Dead's immersion, and Shadow of Mordor's combat, and you get the masterwork that is the Witcher 3.",10,2015-05-20,XBOX ONE,user

Troublewalking,"I've only played a couple of hours so far. Early on it's okay. Feels better than DAI. But is no Skyrim. To put that in terms. Everyone in my family has finished and done multiple characters in Skyrim.. No one finsied DAI. So Witcher 3 at least feels like it's enough for me to finish it. Pro's... 90% open world is a gigantic upgrade for this franchise. Con's Early on this game's 3rd person camera/wind are awkward. (Fortunately both of these seem to adjust after you get to bigger areas). I can't stand the cartoon segment's between areas. It destroys RPG games IMO. It stunk in Diablo III and it stinks in Witcher III. Frankly I'd rather see a loading screen with information, than a lame cartoon. Decision timer is so short sometimes, I don't even see it. Then it defaults to most violent choice. Game doesn't seem to auto save before timer. Which can leave you stuck with a choice you didn't pick. Playing a predetermined/looks/named character seems like RPG stone age. Seriously you have seen the KOTOR, Reven story. So you can do a story about a person, but let the player's customize everything about the toon so they feel apart of the story. Average... The combat view makes me feel like I'm watching it instead of doing it. Something about movement in the game can make the graphics seem very off. Liking seeing a zone wall in old school MMO's. It just ruins immersion. It's magic and leveling up system just seems subpar and restrictive compared to Skyrim. It's graphics are nice, but it's an XB1.

Phangled5,"EDIT: I would like to start out by expressing my genuine thanks to CD Projekt Red. In a world of overpriced, over hyped games which you essentially have to pay double to get the full game (Im sorry but £80 for a game is absolutely ridiculous), CD Projekt Red stands out as a dedicated and fair company. Whats more, the game is actually good! I pre ordered digital and got a 10 percent discount so this masterpiece cost me £40!! It's a pleasure giving my hard earned money to this company because they deserve it, the earned it. Destiny cost me £45 plus another £35, and I played that game for one week before I gave up on that PoS. I have been looking forward to this for a long time and I am pleased to say it really did live up to the hype! Beautiful and huge world to explore. Every quest seems to have a story and choices within it. I like the combat system, and the idea of using potions and oils is really cool. Last night I accepted what seemed to be a regular side quest, and I ended up meeting a very important character from the Withcer 2!! I had goosebumps! I have already put in 10 hours and feel I have barely scratched the surface. I am out now and I am itching to get home, roll a fat one, and play some Witcher!

SkipTheCutscene,"Gorgeous visuals, BUT... as one of the other reviewers pointed out, the movement is very disorienting. It's like they're using a weird focal lens, and it becomes extremely uncomfortable to watch after a short time. It's even more pronounced when using the special ""Witcher Sense"" ability, which is almost headache inducing. Also, be prepared for lots of cut scenes. Lots. Lots, lots, lots, lots. You can skip them, but there are so many, even skipping them takes a long time, because you'll be doing lots and lots of skipping. It's almost like an interactive novel with intermittent action. This is probably my own personal taste, but when I tried to embrace the cutscenes and enjoy it like a movie, it was kind of a letdown too, because ultimately the characters seem like animatrons, and the voiceovers feel very samey, especially relentlessly monotonous lead dude. It's clear the scenes were recorded by individual actors without interacting with each other. In other words, don't expect ""acting,"" or to experience an emotional response... it's just endless exposition. Bottom line, BORING cutscenes. And lots of 'em. IF you're willing to deal with all that, it has fantastic fighting and spell mechanics (way better than Dragon Age) and pretty visuals (albeit presented in a borderline headache inducing way.)

partyintheback,"There's really nothing bad to report with The Witcher 3. The graphics are simply stupendous and a cut above what you're used to with open world RPGs, running at full 1080p. As for the open world, it's absolutely massive, with so much to see and do. You have the main quest, which is told with superbly production values thanks to excellent voice acting, nicely detailed faces, and good animations for the most part. Then you also have the side quests, which unlike many other RPGs where the side quests merely feel like filler, there's a lot more to them here - many of the side quests feel like self-contained stories with satisfying payoffs. In terms of the gameplay, you'll be exploring this massive world, collecting loot, leveling up, unlocking new abilities, and doing everything one would expect from a modern day RPG. Then there's the combat, which may seem different than you're used to at first, and may seem more challenging than some other RPGs since the combat seems to be a lot more animated than most RPGs, but once you master it - and you will - you will love it. I especially love how you can either roll away from enemy attacks, block them, parry them, or my favorite, sidestep them stylishly.

Samblas_96,"Vaya juego este The Witcher 3. En un primer momento lo dejé de lado porque pensaba que no era para mí, pero que equivocado estaba. Darle una segunda oportunidad es de lo mejor que he podido **** historia me ha parecido una pasada, eso sí, con detalles que he perdido por no jugar las otras entregas. Aún así, no es compleja de seguir y se hace muy amena. Las secundarias son casi mejores que la historia principal. Increíble lo que hace este **** banda sonora es impresionante con toques muy épicos cuando llega el momento. El mundo abierto es enorme y puede llegar a sobrepasar, pero si sabes gestionarlo e ir organizando poco a poco el viaje lo vas a disfrutar. A mi me ha parecido una pasada, sobre todo a nivel de exploración. El combate es muy simple, pero en la simpleza es dónde radica la calidad. Se hace sencillo de dorminar con las señales y la verdad que se vuelve **** definitiva, no os lo penséis dos veces.

I'm trying to give it another try at the end of 2023 but stil, It feels clunky to me and not engaging. Give it another try this year and still the same thing, I cannot understand what's good about the game. One thing that I assume would be the cause is due to my expectation that this is an action game which is not. This game is heavily an RPG game with some crafting + narrative driven. To put into perspective, I dislike RPG game, except JRPG (Yes, I'm one of the people that believe RPG and JRPG are two separate genre because they are totally different). Well, The Witcher 3 is just not my cup of tea and I guess it's fine.

Персонажи живые и интересные, отсутствие цензуры одобряем. Сайды тоже Крутые, хэнд мейд почти все, но мало какие именно цепанули. Закончил игру на отличную концовку с Цири. В Политике выбрал Роше.

I wanted to give the PS5 Next Gen upgrade a whirl, hoping that many of the game's rough edges would have been sanded down. No luck. Roach is still awful to ride -- spawns wherever, can't follow a trail, and constantly gets **** on brush. Most of the time I opted to sprint rather than try to use the horse. Anything involving boats is a gigantic PITA. Just skipped anything boat-related. The skill points system is insanely stupid. If you're even a few levels above your current quest, then you're rewarded with next to no points. This effectively de-incentivizes doing any quest that you're overlevelled for. Which may, in the end, be for the best, as this game is INCESSANTLY, INSUFFERABLY fetch-questy.

Это было настоящее испытание, но каждый час, каждая минута, проведенный в игре, оказался абсолютно оправданным. 305 часов в мире Ведьмака пролетели как одно мгновение.Хотя финальная концовка оставила меня с некоторым чувством грусти, это ни в коем случае не портит общий опыт. История, персонажи и мир погружают в себя настолько, что хочется буквально жить в этой вселенной. После основной игры я с головой погрузился в дополнения ""Каменные сердца"" и ""Кровь и вино"". Они не просто дополняют историю, а открывают целый новый пласт приключений, эмоций и великолепной **** Projekt Red задали такую планку качества, что превзойти её будет невероятно сложно. Но именно это делает ожидание ""Ведьмака 4"" столь интригующим. Кажется, что перед разработчиками стоит практически невозможная задача: сделать что-то ещё более впечатляющее.Хочу выразить огромную благодарность за эти сотни часов удовольствия, глубокую и трогательную историю, а также потрясающий геймплей.

Crantonius,"Arguably the greatest RPG of all time. Firstly, the game is undoubtedly a stadound due to the main protaganist, Geralt of Riva, a true all men want to be him and all women want to be with him character. This is then built upon by a plethora of amazing supporting characters set inside a truly unique and massive world. The replayability of the game is for me what makes it truly great. There are so kany RPG's that I would consider a 10/10 on the first playthrough but have no replayability value - This is different. Over the course of the games lifespan i have replayed the game 4 times, each as enioyable as the last. Closing point - The DLC's. More than likely the greatest DLC's of all time. One being basically a standalone game in its own right. Forced to give a 10 here but my true rating is 9.5.

Ed1k,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is not just a game, it is a true masterpiece that remains the benchmark for RPGs years after its release. CD Projekt Red has created a world that is so alive and atmospheric that it seems as if you are really traveling through Velen, the streets of Novigrad or the wild mountains of Skellige. The plot is one of the best in the gaming industry. Every quest, even the smallest, is filled with a deep story and choices that make you think. And the main line with the search for Ciri and the fight against the Wild Hunt is an emotional rollercoaster that keeps you going until the very end. The gameplay is not far behind either. The combat is smooth and dynamic, alchemy and magic add depth, and the possibilities for customizing Geralt - from equipment to play style - make each passage unique. But the real magic is the modifications created by the community. From cosmetic changes to new stories - mods allow you to expand the already huge world. Want to change the combat system? Add new costumes? Or even get additional stories? All this is available thanks to mod support, and it's truly impressive. Also, every detail in the game looks thoughtful. From the dialogues to the little things in the world - everything speaks of love for detail and respect for the players. The soundtrack deserves a special applause - the melodies are so atmospheric that you want to listen to them even outside the game. The Witcher 3 is not just a game, but a phenomenon. It offers something for everyone: a rich storyline, an open world, customizable mechanics, and a community that continues to improve it today. If you haven't played it yet - be sure to fix it, because this journey with Geralt will be remembered forever.",9,2024-11-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Only reading lovers could understand this feeling of truly entering this world.Only reading lovers will be able to understand this feeling, we end up feeling like we are really inside the story of the characters and the world itself, it's not for nothing that great games end up being based on Books already **** despite this, we ended up becoming interested in wanting to know more about the game's world, I was one of the people who fell into Witcher 3, I never got to touch 1 and 2 but I had already seen something, and when it's finished I will definitely give it a leap forward in previous franchises, I don't expect the same level as Witcher 3.{Combat and Mechanics}The combat is not very challenging, with just a few hours to minutes you can understand the basic mechanics, which end up being a reason for many to ignore the game, despite this I found the style of combat that the game gives us interesting. The character's movement ends up being buggy and not synchronized with the game's NPCs, often when dodging or attacking an NPC who is in stun, you still take damage even if the enemy NPC is doing an attack animation and it is cancelled.Even so, I don't find combat boring, I always experiment with ways to try and make it fun, always using combat tactics to simulate that I really am a real witcher.{Graphics and performance}The graphics and the world itself are full of details and things to do, compared to some games where they make you walk 500 km to do something and I find it boring, if I walk around the game every now and then there is always some interaction or special event with someone NPC leaving more and more curiosity and desire to explore new rare or unknown interactions.Performance, although some have reported problems even with PCs at the same level as mine, I have never encountered problems resulting from poor performance, crashes, corrupted saves, etc.I even consider Witcher 3 to be an excellent, very well optimized game.(Side Quests and DLC)In some games we can consider that the side quests are literally to fill you up and make you waste game time, but in this game all the side quests are for you to do, I believe that the contract missions where you have to kill some monsters are not have so much impact but completing missions will give you the possibility to interact with new characters that can affect the main quest in general. Honestly, I wasn't bored with the side quests, which even surprised **** game's expansions are excellent, nothing to criticize them for, and I'm sorry they didn't make an expansion of the Blue Mountains area where at the end of the Bloody Baron's quest he ended up heading off with his **** the game, stop being silly about the combat, if you think the story is horrible, start considering reading some books and opening your mind on that aspect.",8,2024-08-07,PLAYSTATION 4,user

It forces you to ""interact"" and choose dialogue on each stupid conversation. The music sounds out of context and like a background noise. Combat system ... well there is none. Just dodge in the most basic way. The world is cartoonish and repetitive. You feel no difference between different locations in the world. All look and feel the same.

alansaduov,"I would say the game is average. The main story of the game seemed too long, and because of so much side quests it seemed ""обрывисто"". The story in some of the side quests were really interesting and touching, in some not so much. I would say the story of the game is about 7/10. I played the game at the hardest. The level design is bad. At the start, it was super hard to do something, but after 10 or 20 missions I improved enough to have enjoyful experience in gameplay. However, after a while, I understand that the gameplay mainly consisted ""dodge"" + ""attack"". The mechanics of bomb was not comfortable to use. You would iterate all the possible variants to search the one you want. Gwent was really fun. I plan to play this game again, in the future; but before that I want to read all Witcher books and play first two Witcher games. By the way, I suggest playing game in the Normal or maybe in Hard, but not Very Hard definitely because the hardness does not add more gameplay tactics.

Antoine0912,"The Witcher 3, le roi du rpg moderne, celui qui a été maintes et maintes fois copié mais jamais égalé. Après 39h de jeu pour finir la quête principale, je donne mon verdict sur ce jeu. Alors commençons immédiatement par son point fort : l’histoire et la narration, je n’ai jamais vu pareille attention aux détails, les décors, les pnj des villes et surtout les personnages avec qui on a interagi nous racontent tous une histoire crédible, prenante et agréable à suivre. Dans ce monde désolé par la guerre, les décors sont splendides ce qui transforme l’exploration et le transport à dos d’ablettes en un road trip à Velen, Novigrad ou Skellige. Une immense plaine, une grande ville et un archipel nordique voilà ce qui compose cette aventure et comment dire, la diversité rend encore plus belles notre aventure avec Geralt, qu’est-ce que j’ai aimé ce monde. Deuxième point fort de ce jeu et pas des moindres, les quêtes toutes aussi bien écrite de la principale à une simple quête secondaire (le Baron Sanglant, le ptit chien ou les démolisseurs de statues du sang ancien sont mes préférés ). Quel plaisir ce fût de suivre ces dizaines d’aventures. Enfin dernier truc, la BO est aux **** oignons avec ses airs de l’est quel plaisir pour les oreilles durant notre aventure avec le sorceleur. Passons très rapidement aux quelques **** défauts avec en mode normal, un système d’alchimie tout à fait négligeable, un système de craft inutile dans mon aventure et un jeu un poil long donc faire attention au sentiment de lassitude car pendant une quinzaine d’heures on a l’impression de ne pas avancer (à l’inverse des dix dernières qui sont incroyables). Je vais conclure en une phrase, jouez-y, c’est un classique du jeu vidéo, il faut l’avoir fait.",8,2024-03-08,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The side quests are also amazing, they're natural and not forced and give you all choices on how to approach them. Gwent is also a card game within that is unbelievable. I once jumped onto Witcher and spent 4 hours playing Gwent in a tavern in Novigrad and I loved every second of it.

Koukaburra,"This is such a great entry into the series of games. I am a fan of open world games and what a lot of games in the genre do is that there is either no structure/story or too much that things are hindered heavily unless you progress the story. I found the balance in this game to be great and fitting to the fact that you're a monster hunter and have to roam around a fight monsters. The story itself is great and the cast of characters are all compelling to the point I felt awful when some of my actions had terrible consequences later on. With that being said, when it comes to gameplay it does get a little repetitive and mashy. Sure, you'll have to consume a potion every once in a while but that is occasionally and can only be done outside of battle. For most engagements though, you can just attack a lot and use magic occasionally. This game is great and is carried by a very strong story/plot and world building. The gameplay is a little repetitive and straight forward seeing as witchers are super humans that have witcher radar that helps them to solve all their problems.

Dron_Art,"Ох, даже не знаю с чего начать, в этой игре почти всё прекрасно, очень хороший сюжет, великолепная музыка, лор игры невероятен и продуман, очень много интересных и что самое главное уникальных побочных квестов. Я считаю это лучшей игрой в своём жанре. Ещё и следует упомянуть длс к игре которые могут конкурировать с многими полноценными играми. Минус только за задание с ведьмачьим чутьём, слишком много заданий к которым подводят одинаковым образом. Из минусов мне ещё не очень понравилось времяпровождение на Скелиге, там как по мне самый слабый сюжет всравнении с тем же Веленом, но музыка прекрасна так же. Как бы не хотел, но не могу эту игру оценить на 100.. чисто хочется сказать что она идеальна, но на деле есть проблемы технические, встречаются они во всей игре довольно не редко.

MaxieZeus,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a sprawling epic that has left an indelible mark on the RPG genre, celebrated for its expansive open world, engaging quests, and memorable characters. However, the game is not without its share of criticisms, particularly in its gameplay mechanics and the length of the main **** game's greatest strength lies in its rich tapestry of quests. The side quests, often as intricate and compelling as the main storyline, create a vibrant world filled with moral quandaries, political intrigue, and emotionally charged moments. Each quest feels meticulously crafted, presenting players with choices that reverberate through the narrative. The depth and complexity of these quests contribute significantly to the game's immersive quality, ensuring players are drawn into the world of The Witcher 3.Moreover, the characters in The Witcher 3 are a testament to masterful storytelling. Geralt of Rivia, the stoic yet charismatic protagonist, leads a cast of characters with nuanced personalities and compelling backstories. From the sorceress Yennefer to the bard Dandelion, each character feels like a living, breathing entity in a world teeming with life. The relationships and interactions, both friendly and adversarial, are a testament to the game's narrative depth.However, The Witcher 3 falters when it comes to the variety of gameplay mechanics. The combat system, while initially satisfying, can feel repetitive over the course of the game. The reliance on a small set of combat moves and the predictability of enemy encounters can detract from the overall experience. The lack of diversity in gameplay mechanics becomes more apparent as players progress, potentially diminishing the sense of excitement that should accompany late-game **** of the game's major drawbacks is the prolonged main story. While an expansive narrative is often a strong suit for RPGs, The Witcher 3's main story can become overly protracted. The seemingly unending search for Ciri, though initially captivating, can feel like a drawn-out affair. The quest's length may lead to moments of player fatigue, especially when side quests often offer more immediate and gratifying experiences. The balance between the main story's urgency and the expansive world's distractions could have been more finely tuned to prevent narrative fatigue.Additionally, The Witcher 3 simplifies certain RPG mechanics, a decision that has both positive and negative repercussions. On the positive side, it makes the game more accessible to a broader audience, eliminating potential barriers for newcomers to the genre. However, for seasoned RPG players, the simplified mechanics might feel like a step back, robbing the game of some of the depth and complexity that defines the genre. The streamlined nature of the RPG elements might disappoint those who relish the intricacies of character development and choice **** conclusion, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a triumph of storytelling and world-building, with quests that leave a lasting impact and characters that resonate long after the game concludes. However, its gameplay mechanics, characterized by a lack of variety, and the extended main story can be significant detractors. The simplification of RPG mechanics, while enhancing accessibility, may not appeal to RPG purists. Despite these drawbacks, The Witcher 3 remains an exceptional experience, offering a world that's as captivating as it is vast, and a narrative that's as emotionally resonant as it is expansive.Message ChatGPT…ChatGPT can make mistakes.

I tried them and despite older graphics wich did not bother me at all i found them not funny nor dramatic rather embarassing, many dialogues childish even.

greentolar,"I saw my friend playing a game and tried it for a hour so I found it interesting and bought it myself. But for a few hours I got frustrated. Like someone already said there you feel so heavy in combat except dodging. Moves are like you are glued but suddenly so fast lol Then you can use spell you are dead. Riding a horse and it moves are mess too in similar way. I thought Im that clumsy but compared to another games this is mess. Invetory is labyrinth of the chaos. Ok but thats technical problems in some way. Another thing is NPCs. There are two types-frustrated ones with no hope and macho like I have been everywhere and knows everything with tons of useless dialogues to spread their personality or some not interesting info. Story is fine and deep but with dialogues and NPCs like these not really. World is fine feels living. But in Skyrim and Gothic for example you know you are in one cultural region so know the scenery,people and houses is very similar or same. There are many historical lands but feel very similar. Most annoying thing is when you pull up sword in city and its auto considered as a crime. And in terms of RPG its not really RPG but mainly its there to tell you a story I think. For first look its amazing if you get more into it its hard because of fighting system,boring because dialogues and annoying because of how story feels long.

Sicarius089,"This game is in a league of its own. Even on my second play through I'm discovering new things and side quests that I had missed the first time round. Side quests in this game should be the standard of side quests, one series of side quests is basically bare knuckle fighting, one of the first fighters I challenged asked for a favour that I would throw the fight because he had a family to look after. Rejecting his request and beating him, I was able to approach him and talk to him where as the player I could give him money out of the ""goodness"" of Geralt's heart. This is the tip of the ice berg of how in-depth this game is with the plethora of choices you can make that affect the overall world, some choices can lead a village to damnation or it's salvation. In the tutorial area on my second play through I came across a father whose child had been killed by wolves, shortly after leaving his house I came upon the wolves and I too was killed, given how the save works in this game I spawned to just before I approached the house of the father who had lost his child, so wanting to bring justice I went to speak to the Dad again, only to find out that this time the Father had been killed and the child was left an orphan. Again this is the tip of the iceberg of what a player can come across. Exploration rewards the player with experience to level up, loot that can be traded for money (which you will need) gwent cards (which is an addictive game when you understand it), swords, bombs, crossbows, potions, decoctions, armour, as well as diagrams for each of these so you can create new gear; as well as finding bestiary info (to help give you knowledge in what's best to kill a particular enemy). Assigning mutagens is a great way for customising the player experience for how they want to play, if they want to focus on attack they can build up their strength with defence, if they want to be all rounded they can assign mutagens to increase attack, defence, signs (magic) as well as inventory weight capacity. Exploration also rewards the layer with useful items such as equipment for Roach (Geralt's horse) so that you can increase the weight capacity as well as Roach's effectiveness in galloping as well as resilience to fear. You thought that was it? No, there's ruins to explore where Gerald can lift the curse or if he makes a mistake this can lead to the downfall of someone much later in the game. There's monster nests that can be destroyed, the monsters range from water creatures, giant centipedes, nekkers, giant spiders, giant insects, etc some of which if cleared it will cause a return of the human populace to that area. There's underwater exploration as well as a potion to increase underwater breathing. The DLC's just open up the game a lot more and one dlc in particular depending on the outcome changes the circumstances of where Geralt is on the next play through i.e. originally starting off you're in Karen Morhen, whereas depending on the dlc outcome you will start elsewhere and have to find out how to reach your objective (not gonna mention spoilers). Combat is really satisfying when you get used to it, which doesn't take too long, especially when you start increasing the signs. Story was also pretty solid, one aspect I really love was how CDPR blended a fantasy game with basically a detective mode (Witcher senses) as this creates a whole other layer of depth and tests the intuition of the player. There's just way to much to say about this game, with the PS5 version of this with more added content, it's definitely a Masterpiece, unfortunately that word is overused in fandoms but here it's completely justified.",10,2023-07-28,PLAYSTATION 4,user

But all things considered; acting, visuals, atmosphere, story, etc - it scores 8s, 9s. and 10s in every category.

Beautifulyinsan,"the word this game takes to heart is investment, they created a weird that is filled to the brim with things for immersion, the politics, the people and how they will even share there opinions on what is happening, as people would in real life, you meet an emperor as he requests you to find his daughter, but he only cares just because he is his daughter, meaning that he needs someone to follow and become leader, Geralt(who you play as, and the person on the greatest cover art of all time) only accepts to do it because he just wants her to be safe, because he knew her since a young child just learning to just pick up a sword. Geralt himself just wants to do as much as he can to stay out of it, as a witcher he shunned for being a mutated freak, he just believes he can only play his part. the story and characters along with the world you walk through is so lived in, fully realized to build this fantastical, beauty but yet so real world. one moment you may be helping a man find his wife, to then find out that maybe all of it could be staged, but or is real, you really never know cause the quests always present a possible choice, you never know, to then accidentally find a ruined building with a cyclops around there just roaming the area for you to fight and take down, and once you take him down you can reap the rewards which so happens to be the master-crafted version blueprint of one of the best armor sets in the game. the sense of wonder, excitement and terror for what ever new thing you might find, like a new side quest or new cave or treasure to collect. the amount of monsters with a WHOLE FREAKING bestiary to read and look at the many monsters of the game, read on little details with a whole page to look at and the main reason to read it, to find out a monsters weaknesses which are very conveniently showcased. the combat, while ""generic, as I will use lightly"" makes sure that at the heart of it is strategy, using the right damage oil on the right enemy, what bomb to use at this moment, when to swing, not dark souls but it gets challenging, but never impossible as I decided to play on hard, to then eventually change it to very hard(death march) when I got a grasp **** amount of the enemies and wanted more of a challenge and that is what I played the most on. the reason that makes the game challenging is the enemies, they will do what they can to overwhelm you, or use a couple tricks they can have up there sleeves, a great example is the werewolf, they are already rather aggressive, but around lower the 40% of health loss they will roar and start to consistently regenerate heath which puts you in the possession to be as aggressive as they are, which means reacting to his fast swings and chasing him down if he runs away, a basterdly foe, but a lot of fun to fight.. plus no one fight in the game takes to long before it might get stale, they have the perfect energy to keep the pace going of any fight whether or not it is a game of patience or reaction and time. plus the kind of experimentation you have in the skill tree is just the coolest, specialize in Igni and Aard just because, sure why not. or just be raw straight physical sword damage, absolutely. and I believe the most important part to talk about is the games incredible storytelling and the incredible story. the writing making each individual aspect of there character developed as a true identity and facet of everything they do(no spoilers). you feel for what they do because it all comes back to what people would do in real life and the this is what these characters do, more then this is what happens in the story, which is the best kind of character writing. emotional choices over understandable choices, this game will make you see the kind of person you are on the spectrum, and then you get to see the results of YOUR actions, and also how you influenced other characters actions to change there ways or indulge or accept what they are, for the better or for the worst on both ends. the choices you make can make the player terrified of making the wrong choice, and hoping that it could have the best outcome. But I will not spoil any of the story, I really only did that when I talked about the politics, because there is so much game that all must play to see, to watch come down, and wash away the player and envelop and enjoy, with the amount of stuff to do, from rather pointless stuff to do like go to a brother and get laid with which wastes your coin, to LEARNING A WHOLE CARD GAME MADE JUST FOR THIS GAME, called gwent which is way to complicated to explain, but collecting cards to make your deck more powerful by defeating other players is just the coolest hobby to just include for fun, and it is so well designed that it is so hard to believe it is just a sure why not for the game. it exceeds expectations of just being an RPG but an experience, This is one of the greatest games of all time. and one of my top 10 favorite games of all time.",10,2023-07-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Spidertime99,"The Witcher 3 is an epic masterpiece that immerses players in a world filled with multiple conflicts and political wars. The game showcases a rich tapestry of diversity, with an array of monstrous and intelligent creatures each with their own distinct differences, alliances, and motivations. Geralt of Rivia's journey marks the end of his captivating arc, as he navigates complex relationships as a father figure to Ciri, a lover to Yennefer, and a loyal friend to characters like Dandelion. The game's beauty and immersive gameplay, along with its state-of-the-art quests, including the impactful side quests, further deepen the already well-written characters and shape the course of events in this perfect story.

ZXSth,"Every bit of critical praise you've heard about this game is completely valid. The Witcher 3 has just about everything - an extremely compelling narrative, a solid character progression system, and many opportunities to make meaningful choices that affect your world. It is extremely engaging, and will grab hold of your attention without letting go. Of particular excellence are the number of shockingly interesting side quests, along with an open world that offers so many opportunities to explore and gain power, but is also able to be almost entirely ignored if you simply wish to focus on the narrative. Perhaps this game's sole flaw is its so-so combat and movement. Geralt, the game's main character, sometimes can feel a bit stiff to control, and combat, while not at all bad, seems to pale slightly in comparison to similar action RPGs. However, this feels like the only real area of criticism I can give this game beyond an understandable (and only slight) lack of replay value, in my opinion. As stated earlier, the Witcher 3 is phenomenal. If you have not played it, and want either a solid RPG or a gripping narrative, this should be at the top of your list.",9,2023-02-04,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Shend,"This is one of those games that I feel is not for everyone, but those who enjoy it will find it to be one of the best games they've ever played. The story is amazing. I have to be honest, its not on par with something like The Last of Us or Uncharted in terms of animation, voice acting and performances, but that's mostly because this game is much longer than the usual story driven experience, so the reused animations are forgivable. In fact, this game is probably longer than the entire Uncharted series, not even including the two DLC's which individually are longer than most games. There is so much story in this game; so much content, and yet almost all of it is high quality. It's been said a lot, but some of the side quests in this game have better plots than most entire main stories of other games. The narrative is a major part of the game, and the deep and immersive lore and worldbuilding really contributes to that. This is a game that takes place in a world that has existed long before you, and there's so much history to discover. The rest of the game is just good or great. Ill be honest, it doesn't have the best combat, or the best puzzles, and I think the biggest problem I have is how terrible the movement controls are, but all these annoyances pretty much evaporate when you think back on the game. All you remember is exploring a huge and intricate open world, discovering things, making decisions, and OH. Did I not mention the decisions? This game is maybe the biggest argument for the novelty of videogames as a medium for storytelling. The player has a significant influence on the story, ranging from which romantic interest the protagonist ends up with, to your relationship with your child, what side characters live and die, and even who wins the war. The choices are really well represented as being gray in morality, and with complicated, unforeseeable consequences. Not only does this add a lot of replay value to the game, but it makes the story much more personal, and the consequences are much more weighty when you know that people died because of you, not because of the plot. Overall, this game is maybe a 4/5. But the story and world are so great that it completely overshadows any flaws with the gameplay. Its an easy 5/5.",10,2023-01-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The game starts with the autosave that was made BEFORE this bs update and as i said before there is NOTHING you can do about it.

Crimson9,"The Witcher 3 does one thing exceptionally well: writing! The sidequests in particular have an extraordinary level of quality and quantity, and together make this game exceptionally immersive. The main story doesn't quite reach the level of writing of some of the side content (especially the Baron's plot), but its still solid. The world and the music are also exceptional. However, the game still gets a 7. Ultimately, the gameplay is 20% dialogue, 20% traversal, 60% combat. The dialogue is great but its not like this is a CRPG of old which provides many branching decisions. The world is beautiful and full of lore and consistency in world building, but the traversal is not involved whatsoever. The combat is very clunky. This is a looong game, and the gameplay is the main focus. So while the writing is exceptional, I can't give this game more than a 7 given how poor the gameplay is.",7,2022-12-12,PLAYSTATION 4,user
RolandOG,"Having played through three times- as well as those in-between the years partial playthroughs that tend to happen- including both expansions, I can say with absolute certainty that the Witcher III is a complete masterpiece of epic proportions. I love every minute, every quest, character and detail. It is true that not everything is totally perfect, but it just doesn’t matter. When the PS5 version releases, I will play through again, starting from scratch, and then again on New Game+. There will never be another Geralt of Rivia in gaming. Not in today’s age, when old white guys would never fly. Especially the White Wolf. Relish it for all it’s worth and relish it some more. I love Ciri and would play a new game with only her, but Geralt is what powers the original games, just as he’s the central to the books. Geralt makes the game, and the Netflix show.

This game is no different in that regard - the various role-playing systems are good, but have a bit of jank. The world is gorgeous but perhaps a but too full of things to do. Combat is good, but without the good chances for cheese you have, it would have been a bit stale after while. Still, the storytelling in this game, and the moral ambiguity of much of it, captivated me in a way few video games, or even movies or TV programs, manage to do. Hats off to the developers. The additional expansions were great, and I actually enjoyed Blood and Wine as much, if not more, than the main game (though I think you have to really like what the game gives you to do to want to play another 30+ hours of it).

CnPx98,"To start with the controls are horrible. They are easily some of the most messed up controls I have ever played a game like this with. Seriously what were you think when you made triangle, heavy attack, square light attack, circle jump and X to mount house??? But no option to even change them even in the Ps5 update. It's just disappointing. I can adjust to new controls when they aren't that bad but these ones were impossible to get use to because they are so obscure. When your swimming under water you hold circle to surface. CIRCLE! It's X in every other game in the world but it's circle in this game. Story is quite good. Downsides are missions have to high level requirements as it takes for ages to earn enough levels to do them. So you basically do 1 story mission, several side missions and stuff then another story mission. Why are sidemissions so forced in this game rather then just make them optional? This makes it hours in-between each story mission. Every single fight is like this. The boss fights all have health regen. Like all of them. It's annoying when you have no idea how well a boss fight is going. Am I half way through? Am I doing well or is he gonna fill his health bar 3 more times.

IronWolfFang,"One of my top 5 games... story, game mechanics and graphics are all brilliant. There are many positives about this game but something important to me is the side quests... the side quests in most games can be bland and long winded but i can say that in thw witcher, almost all of the quests were either fun or interesting or both. For example, there is one quest that you get later down the line which involves multiple different creatures working together, trying to ambush the witcher, as they see him as just a monster hunter, but the witcher can turn the tables on the leader if he has treated creatures kindly throught the game and i just think its a brilliant quest and really shows how good the devs are at story telling",9,2022-09-30,PLAYSTATION 4,user

BrianDavid94,"Quick background on me the reviewer, I tend to like single player games that is heavy on narrative the most. I also play a lot of racing games and use to play multiplayer games in my high school days but now that it's hard for me and my friends to find a good time to link up so now it’s more rare for me to get into a multiplayer game. Up to try any genre of games and sometimes I find something new that I didn't think I'd like. I own a PC (built by me), Xbox One X, Xbox Series X, PS3, PS4, PS5, and a Switch. I prefer Playstation due to their focus on narrative games. For scoring, I’ll be using the Gameinformer review scale and of coursed influenced by my personal opinions. (10)Outstanding. A truly elite title that is nearly perfect in every way. This score is given out rarely and indicates a game that cannot be missed. The world feels so alive. Side missions feel like they are their own story. The attention of detail is just impressive. CD Project Red has a bright future if they keep this up. The only improvement needed is the combat but their world and atmosphere is what makes this game a masterpiece.",10,2022-08-29,PLAYSTATION 4,user

It has all of it: absolutely gorgeous graphics , breathtaking and touching both main storyline with various exoduses and side quests, overwhelming diversity of activities. Simply saying, the creation of CDPR is unbelievably close to the title of ""The dream game"". However, the fighting system feels not quite polished enough and some main quests fall apart while comparing to other ones.

ehtaco,"Ever since first playing this game and completing the DLC's, this has been easily my favorite game of all time. It's such a fantastic game it's hard for me to even point to any faults. You could argue the combat is a bit clunky, you could argue that the game takes a while to get ""good,"" but everything else about the game is so absurdly great that I don't even care. The game itself is an all-timer but the DLC's push it over the edge. Legitimately two of the best DLC's for any game ever, especially Blood & Wine. They add so much content to the game. The base game took me roughly 110h to play through, and I took my time with it. I didn't 100% it either. And we're not talking Ubisoft 100h either where half of that is just drivel. This is 100h of actual content, story, and intriguing side missions. There was still more to do. The two DLC's combined added another 50h give or take, and considering the deals you can find on the Complete Edition of this game nowadays with all the content, it's such a steal at this rate it's ridiculous. I can't recommend this enough.",10,2022-08-11,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Most of the voice acting is very good or good, with a few of the normal cast that mar. The combat is solid and the leveling system is compelling with plenty of routes and playstyles. Though there are plenty of recurring things that wear thin: damageable materials, recap voices on loading screens, and poor horse riding to name a few. The story is great, though some of the final battles don't meet expectations. I'm especially impressed with the side quests as they often have unique and intriguing tales of their own; I finished all the non-DLC ones. I've never put so many hours into a single game, and it is a testament to its breadth and its quality. Even if it's not perfect.

chrisdan23,"Mit dem dritten Teil der Witcher Trilogie liefern CD Project Red ihr bisheriges Meisterstück ab. Überzeugten die Witcher Spiele seit jeher als hervorragende Erzählung, bettet der dritte Teil die erzählerischen Qualitäten der Reihe nun in eine Open World ein, die ebenso neue Maßstäbe zu setzen weiß. Bei dem Irrwitz an Detailverliebtheit und Lebendigkeit, die bisher kaum eine andere Open World so realisiert hat, kann man ohne Probleme bis zu 100 Stunden Lebenszeit in der riesigen und unglaublich authentisch wirkenden Spielewelt des Hexers Geralt von Riva verbringen. Inkl. der DLC Erweiterungen, welche die Karte und den Content nochmals immens erweitern, können es dann gerne auch nochmal 50 Stunden mehr werden. Trotz auch klar auszumachender Schwächen, beispielsweise in der Charakterentwicklung und hier und da einmal etwas hakeligem Gameplay - im Großen und Ganzen überzeugt Wild Hunt auch hinsichtlich seiner Mechaniken. Das Kartenspiel Gwint wird vermutlich als das beste Minigame aller Zeiten in die Videospielgeschichte eingehen. Die größte Stärke von The Witcher III ist aber das Quest Design. Kein anderes Adventure oder Rollenspiel füllt seine Open World mit dermaßen konsequent hochwertigen Content.

""The Witcher III"" is easily the best game not only in 2015, it is one of the few very best games i have ever played. To write about all ~100 hours + that i have played through till finishing the story would need more then 1 page, so i try to be short as possible. Probably never before i was captivated by open world then in this game. It is huge. And i mean HUGE! There a tons of activities, and every one of them is interesting, it keeps you going further, explore and etc. Gameplay is outstanding. Fights are incredibly done, they are brutal, so as this world. Graphics are amazing. Music! What a score and especially during battles - great stuff. Voice acting was superb by all involved. Just to thing how much effort was put into creating every single thing and detail in this game is mind blowing. To be honest i wasn't a fan of ""Witcher II"", haven't even played the first one. But after finishing ""Wild Hunt"" i can safely say - count me in for (hopefuly) next installments. This is simply one of the very best games ever created. Overall, ""The Witcher III: Wild Hunt"" is a masterpiece. I do not use this word usually, but in this case it is the one that perfectly summarize this experience.

tsmith2001,"Exploration in an open-world setting, alteration of gameplay based on personal choices, and the main storyline accompanied by numerous side quests ultimately define an ideal role-playing game, also known as an RPG. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt encompasses these elements and takes them to the next level. The player progresses through the game as Geralt of Rivia, a monster-hunting Witcher who aims to rescue his former apprentice, Cirilla, from being captured by the Wild Hunt (an army of elves from another world) for her powerful Elder Blood. During the playthrough, the player is immersed in a vast, breathtaking world that almost feels alive where character abilities, craftable potions, and ranged weapons are utilized in combat. Relationships can be formed with detailed, engaging characters, even those who play minor roles in the story. The story itself relies on the decisions made throughout the game, no matter how small those choices may seem. Making these decisions not only connects one with Geralt emotionally but also arranges an unpredictable, unique playthrough in which the player is bound to face the consequences. Choosing which characters to kill, help, or become romantically involved with impacts the endings of quests and the storyline overall. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt isn’t the type of game where it’s explicitly stated which options are morally correct or not; the outcomes occur naturally and give one a sense of freedom with their choices. In her Game Informer article, Kimberley Wallace describes “how the writers are always one step ahead and [her] decisions are never safe; the shades of gray mean that [one may] never know who to trust, requiring [one] to think carefully about every situation” (2015). This perfectly embodies the importance of the decision-making aspect of the game and how each choice is questionable and based on trust and beliefs. The characters are just as compelling as the story, as they are charming in their own way and completely believable. The player may feel emotionally impacted by the bonds that are formed, relate to their personalities, and can observe the in-depth character development of each person. The details and realism are recognizable in everybody, from Geralt to a minor character stumbled upon in an optional subquest. Gabriel Zamora expresses the richness of the characters in his own PCMag review, “Characters from the stories are fleshed out fantastically, often through their dialogue alone. Subtle gestures and facial expressions also breathe life into each personality, too” (2015). The individuality and authenticity of each person make them quite unforgettable, setting them apart from characters in other RPG games. Even so, listening to every character reminisce about their past can become tiresome and repetitive. Main quests and intensive side quests piece together the telling of a mesmerizing story. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt incorporates considerable detail in each quest, and the side quests themselves relate to the main story and its lore. They stray from typical side stories in other games, as they aren’t basic “recover this item” missions or ones where the player has to follow excruciatingly slow-walking characters. Completing these quests, along with the main story, allows one to play this game for hundreds of hours. However, undertaking these side quests can prove to be time-consuming, which may not be fitting for every player. Luckily, they’re not obligatory and the player can solely stick to the main story if they choose to do so. Overall, the player constantly wonders what will happen next, from the very beginning to the end. In essence, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt can be considered one of the most innovative, exemplary RPGs ever made. Completing the game might make one feel empty, but knowing they can replay it by making different choices or even to 100% it makes it worthwhile. Various aspects of the game create a memorable experience for anybody to enjoy.

AndreyCloud,"Great game overall. The multilayered story line based on your decisions is nutty, the number of endings and possibilities you can get is absolutely sick. Every choice and decision will have you second guessing yourself and never knowing the full outcome in the end. The side quests all matter in the main story as well, makes every bit of the game matter and will keep you occupied for hours on end. The combat is good, not great in my opinion, could have a lot more fluidity, feels very frigid and glitchy at times, like getting stuck on rocks or the interact is always busted. I encountered a lot of general glitches as well like game crashes, stuck in weird camera angles, npcs slow and not following me when needed, waymarkers not working at times, etc. All the story elements of this game are top tier quality, the mechanic and technical side of the game is a bit lacking and can be a lot better. If assassin creed type of mechanics and character control were implemented here it would have been a perfect 10/10.",9,2022-01-25,PLAYSTATION 4,user
FidelGastro,"Absolutely phenomenal game. There's almost nothing in the game that I couldn't give a rating of at least 9/10.

And I wasn't bored for even one minute of the time I devoted to this game. I think I could easily spend another ten or even twenty hours in the base game if I wanted to. I only encountered one bug in the entire game, and that was in the final bossfight against Eredin, when the camera got stuck at an angle away from the fight after going through a portal. The bug was resolved by loading the last saved position. Considering I played the game on PS5 I was very pleasantly surprised. I can't wait to play the two DLCs that come with the game. My expectations are high. Without further thought I give the game a very well deserved 10/10 !",10,2022-01-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Faxthtax,"Game is Epic enough. Story is good enough for me. What is not so great and REALLY drags the score down is the gameplay and controls. I can not remember the last time i played a game with such poor controls and combat as this one. Walking, running, riding horse is a pain. Geralt seem to go his own way at times when you dont walk in a straight line. idle controls are too sharp. No lag (which it should have had) and completely back to 1990´s style. Ugh. Riding your horse (named Roach, short for cockroach in real life) in the wild is painful in places where there is small obstacles. Roach is pretty dumb, instead of just do a small jump over it, he decides instead to come to a complete halt or run and go nowhere because of an invisible wall. And you bump into those, small obstacles or a tiny ledge keeps you walking without passing it. Combat was already outdated when the game was released. A very bareboned system. Hack, slash, dodge and hope for the best. Fighting groups is hopeless, they all come at you and you keep dodging until you find an opening. Devoid of choices and tactics, the combat is completely one-dimensional and dull / frustrating. Story wise its okay. Geralt is your usual tough guy. But overall a boring guy. Best and most interesting character is Ciri. During your playtrough there is too many characters you bump into, but neither has any develpment or are someone you care for. Inventory, menu are too large, clunky and messy with so much you do not need to care for. CPR did better story wise with Cyberpunk, but the game was a mess, and this is not unique either when you favour in the bugs. They are there. plenty-full. The TV-Show is a much better view. Much better character development and story. And you are much better off watching that than playing this mediocre game. CD Project Red along side **** Punch is one of the most overrated game developers out there.

NickellPro,"Плюсы: + графика (очень красивая, целостная картинка, всё ещё держит планку по сравнению с новинками) + сюжет (увлекательное завершение истории Геральта из Ривии; игра самостоятельна, не требует обязательного прохождения первых двух частей чтобы погрузиться в сюжет) + персонажи (у каждого свои привычки, точка зрения, отношение к главному герою, история; с ними очень больно расставаться в конце игры) + открытый мир (сделан согласно книгам, очень атмосферно и детально; под каждым кустом что-то интересное, у каждого региона свои обычаи, люди, опасности) + побочные квесты (ни один квест не повторяет другой, это всё отдельные мини-истории со своим мини-сюжетом и героями (кроме поиска различных сокровищ, хотя и у них есть предыстория); некоторые побочные квесты напрямую влияют на основной сюжет, что приводит к определённым последствиям) + нелинейность прохождения (в игре 3 концовки, зависящие от выборов игрока на протяжении всей игры и побочных квестов; каждый побочный квест так же имеет несколько концовок, поэтому за одно прохождение увидеть все концовки квестов просто невозможно) + музыка (это настоящий шедевр, настолько атмосферную и завораживающую музыку услышишь далеко не в каждой игре; её хочется слушать отдельно от игры, она навевает разные воспоминания, хорошие и плохие) + потрясающие DLC (без них Ведьмак 3 раскрывается всего на 50%, это совершенно новые истории, персонажи, побочные квесты и локации, в которые хочется возвращаться снова и снова, будто погостить) + снаряжение (по миру спрятано невероятное количество брони, мечей, снаряжения для лошади, со своими сильными и слабыми сторонами, а также лучшая броня разных ведьмачьих школ, у которых свои разные техники ведения боя) Минусы: - огромное количество багов (это и летающие NPC, и неуправляемая Плотва, и бессмертные враги и т.п; хотя они и встречаются не так часто как могли, они крайне неприятны) - долгие загрузки (больнее всего умирать понимая, что сейчас придётся ждать длительную загрузку сохранения; тоже самое касается и перемещения между локациями) - заторможенная или ускоренная речь персонажей (в некоторых случаях озвучка не вмещается в действующий кадр, из-за чего её приходится либо замедлять, либо ускорять, что звучит очень нелепо, и иногда портит момент) Может не понравиться: = тот-же самый ""Гвинт"" (многим он не пришелся по вкусу, и часто раздражал игроков своей навязчивостью) = точки ""?"" интереса на карте (они все довольно однообразны, их исследование может быстро надоесть) Итог: игра невероятно огромна, наполнена интереснейшими квестами и увлекательным основным сюжетом, но многим она может показаться до боли скучной и унылой, из-за однообразных точек ""?"" интереса.",9,2022-01-07,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Radrin,"- Very well-written, in-depth characters and nuanced interpersonal relationships; - Great visuals for a huge open world game; - Fantastic music; - intricate story with some great plot twists and moral dilemmas; - Exploration/sidequest with a heavy focus on dialogue and narrative hooks which is rare to see in most open world rpg's since they're riddled with standard fetch/kill quests without anything interesting attached to them; - Stellar voice acting alongside natural, realistic and witty dialogue; - Compelling lore to explore; - impactful decisions that change the in-game world and story; - Great world design that hooks you into exploration; Absolutely tear inducing after I realized it was over, like finishing a really amazing book, movie or tv series. One of the greatest strengths of this game, besides the characters, is how they introduce diverse, (not copy pasted) carefully written narrative and story into side quests. The vast majority of content in this game feels unique and worth exploring even without any material gain, because while you might find 2 quests that involve “finding someone” which introduces you into the same core gameplay loop of searching for clues that lead to your objective and fighting/talking your way into completing it, one of the quests might involve trolls that kidnapped a shoe maker because they have an obsessive love for shoes and the other could involve a sweet old couple that, with further investigation, you might find, are cannibals that feed off of live people or corpses, and in both situations you are given options to decide what YOUR version of Geralt would do, with valid reasons for each choice available. The game could have benefitted from harder enemies and better, more diverse and impactful loot.(weapons and armors mainly.) As it stands there is no reason to use anything other than the witcher school armor/weapon sets since they're way better than anything else and it's a bummer because the weapon and armor design is really good in this game, so it would be nice to have some incentive to use other equipment. While the gameplay and animations are extremely smooth, playing Geralt, a witcher, might feel restrictive in terms of gameplay options, although I didn’t mind this compromise in favor of immersion. While the graphics were amazing for a game this size, the grass/plants/tree didn’t have volumetric textures. There is an argument to be made to shorten the main story for the base game as it can overstay its welcome at times, although most parts were very compelling. Best case would probably be taking parts of the main story and making them side content since they're still really good so cutting them completely from the game would be a disservice. It's worth mentioning that this game is very dialogue based and it goes usually goes into detail without cutting any corners so it will involve A LOT of reading, if you prefer gameplay that revolves around a lot of action instead then this might not be the ideal choice for you.",10,2021-12-26,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Everything else about it is perfect. And just like Bloodborne, this is one of the most immersive, detailed and perfectly crafted worlds there are to explore and enjoy yourself.

We get great music, and a massive world with garbage annoying swamp areas that can eat my ass, and a big awesome medieval city where the game improves massively. We also get memorable characters with awesome sex questlines :D CDPR creates all these things, all these ingredients for something potentially special, and throws them into this fu***** s*** game.

CDPR messes up the most important part ****, the GAAAAAME. Why? Just seems like no-one seems to have fu***** bothered. I am utterly lost for words.

Zaicron,"Como já fazem muitos anos é impossível lembrar de tudo para opinar. Porem não deixa de ser um bom momento para dar nota, já que não existe mais a emoção do desconhecido. Lembro que eu achei a gameplay confusa e bagunçada no inicio, e se não me engano cheguei a falar que o estilo de combate era um lixo nos primeiros, mas isso pode ser em partes pq esse foi meu primeiro jogo da franquia e comecei direto na ultima dificuldade. Porem, depois de acostumar com o estilo, não tive mais problemas. O jogo estava bem difícil no inicio, se tornou tranquilo em algum momento e ali pelo lvl 15 o ficou fácil. Claro sou dos que explora cada canto e sai fazendo tudo que encontra pelo mapa com base em lvl, o que deve ter facilitado para o progresso do meu personagem. Sobre os termos técnicos não tenho o que falar, é tudo maravilhoso. A história principal é boa, mas mesmo eu gostando, não é algo surpreendente, porem quando coloca as histórias de todas as outras missões que vão surgindo pelo mundo conforme você avança, não tem como não se apaixonar pelo capricho. Você sente o mundo vivo e funcionando para além dos interesses do protagonista, tendo algumas histórias que são ão boas ou até melhores do que a principal. Em relação a mundo aberto acredito que the witcher deu uma aula sobre como um jogo deveria ser.

There are also disadvantages, they are related to the technical execution of the game, however, against the background of the high quality of everything else, they are less noticeable: - stupid AI NPCs, as a result, a huge number of NPCs in big cities (Novigrad, Tussent) ruins the immersion. - A small number of different faces in NPCs, as a result, twins are constantly found, which may seem absurd and misleading. - Least significant disadvantage: bugs, in fact, the presence of bugs in the open world games is normal, The Witcher 3:Wild Hunt is no exception in this regard.",9,2021-07-22,PLAYSTATION 4,user

It’s a masterpiece, great story, characters that you absolutely relate with, romance, battles, bosses, crafting, NSFW content if you know what I mean, exploration, leveling, Roach the bugged horse (it’s a funny one, actually), a mini game that is called “gwent”, and ladies and gentlemen, you will be so addicted in gwent that you are going to play hours and hours before you go back to the main quests. Geralt is a legendary and famous Witcher (but not so much loved by the people), that is looking for a sorcerer called Yennefer, in order to check out your considered “daughter”, Ciri, a girl that both of them don’t see for years. They believe she might be in danger.

Vegito901,"Ok now I got to be honest in this one. At first I felt At the beginning I felt that the game was too overwhelming, too big and too adult for me because I came from Skyrim, and to make a comparison was impossible because they were the ''two greats'' of the genre. I watched an advice video about the game. When I came back I was excited, and when I left White Orchard.... 210 hours are the number of hours I have played. I've played the main campaign 2 times and I'm waiting for the next-gen update to play the DLC's again. The world of The Witcher 3, the Continent, is plagued with evilness, hunger, suffering, sadness and war, that's what you see, and the folklore and richness of the world will make all this stuff charming. Thanks to the huge amount of different and side quests, enemies, how the world reacts to you and your decisions (nothing to do with Skyrim by the way), the beauty of the game itself, the characters, the story, even the gameplay, everything! This game will catch you, and when you finish it you will realize that you played the best game ever. And that if you used your time for something worthwhile. 5000 characters are too few to be able to express all the love and respect I have for this game, all the affection I have acquired for the characters and how I enjoyed the main campaign. But maybe they are enough to talk about the DLC's. Hearts of Stone is fantastic and introduces you to one of the best villains of the saga of video games, I do not want to detail more because although it is worthwhile, what I want to talk more than anything is the second DLC. And even so, it's a sin not to buy the whole game. Blood and Wine... Imagine a place where you gather the most beautiful of French, Italian and Spanish culture. That beautiful music, those colors, that attitude of the inhabitants of Toussaint... after wars and suffering, after death, you arrive in a world full of life, wealth, abundance and nobility. Someone who has a strong European identity would cry from happiness if such a place existed. Toussaint is magnificent, and I repeat it because I measure my words, MAGNIFICENT. A year after playing the DLC I am still humming the songs, I even have them downloaded on my phone and know how to play them on instrument. I already loved The Witcher 3, it was already the best game I'd ever played in my life, and then came Toussaint.... It's a near perfect game. It's magnificent. It's wonderful. It's The Witcher 3.",10,2021-04-05,PLAYSTATION 4,user

I was looking through Gamepass for a mediocre game that I would probably play twice and never touch again. As i was nearing the bottom a certain game caught my eye. That game was The Witcher 3. I never used to believe in love at first sight but that fateful moment demolished any doubt i had. I played the everloving f*ck out of it. Quite frankly I was addicted. I stopped everything i was doing including certain necessities like eating and sleeping to play the game. I will not spoil anything as that would be punishable by the most painful medieval torture method that is. The game is leaving Gamepass soon and even though I've played it 3 times, i'd buy it.",10,2021-03-05,PLAYSTATION 4,user

jkuras08223,"The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt is the tip of the Iceberg of open world experiences. With a deeply engaging world and lovable characters. This game has everything you want in a story driven RPG. I played the Witcher 3 Wild Hunt for the first time ever in 2021 and it looks amazing for a 5 year old game. It also has one of the best story lines in a video game to date. Every Quest has different outcomes, even side quests. I have played 100 hours of the game and it has some of the best immersion in an open world game ever. The Cut scenes play a massive part in the immersion. The game feels lived in. This and Red Dead Redemption 2. This game has some of the best Characters that you care for deeply. This game puts you on an emotional rollercoaster with its 57 main quests and around 250 side missions. Every cutscene has a quest changing choice. It really is breathtaking. The combat is fun and I played the game on blood and broken bones difficulty and once you get past level 10 the game is easier. There are so many different types of swords and special swords you might have seen in past Witcher games. You can use spells that can be upgraded in a skill tree and each of them are used for different situations. You also use different environmental bombs that can help you fight certain enemies. The Witcher 3 also has some entertaining romance story lines that have multiple outcomes; the two most popular ones are Yennefer of Vengerberg and Triss Merigold. Which are both some of the best romance stories in video games. The end verdict is that Witcher 3 is one of the most ground breaking games of the Playstation 4 and Xbox one era and is a must play in my book and completely out does CD Projekt Red Cyberpunk2077 most recent release and I hope they can go back to the quality of the WItcher 3.",10,2021-02-17,PLAYSTATION 4,user

ankokukishijp,"I was really excited when I first got the physical copy of the game. It was well packaged and I could feel it, ""This is going to be one of the best games I will play!"". After playing games for decades I usually have this ""hunch"" whether I would like this game or not by seeing the cover of the game. I was mind blown the first few hours! The feeling was unique! I played many open world RPG and this is the first time I have seen the Story so well-developed! Not only that, the side quest itself is NOT a ""copy paste of go here, fetch that, return here"" type of lazy settings, it was well written and every interactions you had with this side quest, somehow affected the main story. Geralt the main character is also very unique and I could see this character serialized for a movie (it did). The world, the atmosphere was supportive enough to get you immersed in it. I was sure I would play this game for long time. So i thought. The ""Magic"" starts disappearing after the first 3 hours, then I was completely snapped out of Witcher's Charm after putting 5 hours. In total I have played about 12 hours and reached Novigrad halfway. What happened? I was overhyped. The story was well written, settings was well set. But that's it. Combat was just okay to get you going from one story to another story, it is clunky and boring tbh. Customization is quite limited. Outside of the main story, the environment feels very dead, you do not get many surprise element; although side quest is very engaging I'd still insist. Having skipped 1 and 2, i began to feel less and less connected as i progess further to the main character as more new terms and jargons been throwed in the main story. Combat became really boring after you figure out how to dodge enemies. Magic and Alchemy feels less impactful, its like just using an item from a paused-enabled menu. I can't explain very well, but overall I feel like this game may be rushed for some reasons. The pre-planning concept was well done; however execution of the development was all over the place. In conclusion, don't get me wrong, I think this game DESERVES a well-praised! The developer has put enough effort , time and expertise in creating such an amazing series! But the media has been over-hyping this in a sense it is like a bubble. I think this game is great but definitely not 9 / 10. A Fair judgment would be between 7 to 8 out of 10. To normalize this overhyped / overbubbled high ratings, please forgive me of giving this rating a zero because while I acknowledge the game's greatness, I want to be fair to all other gamers out there whom may have a spoiled experience because of the expectations of ""9/10"", ""GOTY!"", ""Masterpiece"" type of reviews being distributed all over the internet. You would be able to enjoy this game more with lower expectations. Do not fall into the same trap like me.",0,2021-02-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Should Spend this 10-20€ and get it. And everyone should get the GOTY Edition the 2 DLC Heart of Stone & Blood and Wine are one of the Best DLCs every Created. Both DLCs add arround 15 Hours of Story and would be as a Standalone better than 90% of the Full Priced Games. 10/10 Greates of all Time,10,2021-02-06,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Eienmatt,"I finally completed Witcher 3 after trying to get into it when it was released and again a year later. Having put well over 100 hours into it, i can say that it does some things well and does some things terribly. The best thing it does is create an open world begging to be explored. I so often enjoyed seeking out a ""?"" to find a side story, some treasure or a fun battle. It also has some great character development. I genuinely cared about several side characters and enjoyed seeing how my choices played out. The worst thing it does is in regards to it's battle system, item management and leveling system. The battle system is just... bad. It may have been good in 2015, but by 2020's standards, it's clunky, boring and repetitive. It also seems to want you to use magic and a variety of weapons but these are attached to ring selection systems that detract from the overall action. Item management is rough. The UI isn't great overall on the PS4 but trying to keep track of crafting, junk, collectables, consumables, etc, takes much entering/exiting of several menus and submenus. The levelling system is interesting in concept but starts to get boring about 40 hours in. The limited number of slots means that you really have to specialize, which isn't always great depending on the enemies you encounter. Further, it feels like the game wants you to try a few different Geralt types (speedy/tanky/magic/etc) but trying to do this requires rebuilding and reorganizing your character quite a bit. None of this is easy to do or convenient. Overall, i think this type of game must appeal to a certain type of gamer as the positive reviews really had me scratching my head as i tried over and over to get into it. I can say now that the game is probably worth $20 but was never worth full price. As well, if you feel like you're not able to get into the game, it probably won't change - even after forcing yourself to continue on just a little longer. i wouldn't spend time buying the add-ons as you'll be burnt out before you get tot them anyway.",6,2021-02-05,PLAYSTATION 4,user

LMAO that game is batman arkham with swords, and it’s so unbelievably easy I can beat that game playing with my toes, blindfolded, facing away from the TV....with no sound. You my friend, just **** frozen poop nuggets. The story in this game is evolutionary and unpredictable, you can moprh your own path, some characters will not survive based on the decisions you make. You can screw a bunch of chicks in this game, kiera metz is a must. The var attre sisters are so hot hopefully we can have a threesome in the next game. The characters in this game are so amazing I feel like I know them in real life. The big open world is full of life so much side content, characters, and secrets hidden in all of the little nooks and crannies all over, and not just some boring depressing trash lifeless padded world full of nothing but mountains and tumbleweed like in a hideo kojima game, or a ubisoft game like assassins creed or watchdogs or something. The boss fights in the game are great and you have to be skilled to beat them, if you can’t beat them and instead come on here to complain about the combat.. it’s okay, just put down your controller, crawl into your corner and **** your thumb until u fall asleep because you are a droopy diaper baby.

The game design and the different beasts made are very suggestive. I do not rule out the presence of bugs, some rare drop in fps or texture, as well as dropping objects and a difficult horse to control in tight places or in the presence of obstacles but they do not compromise the gameplay. The story, indeed, the stories, are well detailed and intersected with each other and your choices have multiple effects on all people and the events connected to them.

TragicShow,"The Witcher 3 is quite simply a great game. Not only is it great in its own merit, but when compared to the last entry, there is little comparison as TW3 has improved on almost every aspect. I have put 60 hours into this game, and it hasn't crashed once. Something that took me away when playing this game is how truly unique each of the side quests are. In typical RPGs, the general rule for side quests is to go to point A, kill everything/retrieve item, and then return. The Witcher makes every side quest feel unique with interesting characters and objectives, and it manages to keep them all interesting. I only have a few gripes with this game; including the inability to wear helmets and the severe lack of armor variations. These of course are very minor complaints, and it wouldn't be normal for Geralt to wear helmets anyway. The combat can also get a bit repetitive, and it is generally a lot easier than the previous game in all regards. The music selection during combat is also very limited. My main issue with the game, however, is the gear system. Gear which you get is automatically leveled to whatever level you are when you obtain it. Meaning that if you get the legendary grandmaster witcher armor (which takes upwards of 10 hours to collect a full set), it is going to be totally obsolete after five levels. You also can't upgrade it, making it worthless if you choose to get it early on. If you decide to get it near the end of the game, it's also useless because you've already finished most if not all of the missions.",8,2020-12-20,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The game railroads you into quests so exploration is discouraged. You do get to see **** in the game so maybe that is why so many thirsty nerds like the game.

No side quest feels like a grind, they are genuinely thoughtful and intriguing.

assassinader200,"Posiblemente es el mejor videojuego que he jugado hasta la fecha. Cuando hablamos de ""The Witcher 3"" vemos al instante a un viejo brujo con el pelo cenicineto, con su hoja de plata desenvainada y ""bailando"" con monstruos. Esa imagen la transmite este videojuego. Empezaremos con la ambientación. El mundo del escritor polaco Andrzej Sapkowski es inmesno y aunque en esta entrega solo se desvela una pequeña parte parece que es gigantesco al mismo tiempo. Ciudades como Novifrado, Oxenfurt o Velén transmiten diferentes emociones. El cambio de paisajes y escenarios es increíble acompañado de cambios climáticos y de una banda sonora espectacular que también varia según la situación y el lugar. Es un mapa cargado de detalles, colorido y al mismo tiempo sombrío, lleno de paz y al mismo tiempo de crueldad. Sin duda l@s muchach@s de CD Project Red han estudiado al detalle la ambientación. Por otro lado tenemos una mejora en el combate respecto a ""The Witcher 2: Assassin of Kings"", nuevas animaciones, mas fluidez en combate y mas realismo son algunas de las mejoras. Además, cada combate parece ser único, los enfrentamientos con monstruos son increíbles y estos se complementan de diversas habilidades comprables con puntos de habilidad. Geralt de Rivia se encuentra en su madurez, es un personaje realmente elaborado hasta el último detalle. Es frío y al mismo tiempo romántico, audaz, cargado de una personalidad fielmente recreada como en los libros; es el brujo definitivo. El resto de personajes secundarios son también excepcionales y **** horas en representarlos. Lo que más fascina, a parte de su mundo, de la personalización de Geralt o su enorme bestiario, son las misiones secundarias. Si por algo podemos decir que es un gran juego es por esto. Cada misión secundaria es única, muy diferente al resto. En cada una aparecen personajes únicos, no NPCs aburridos. Los contratos de brujo, aparte de ofrecer generosas recompensas (espadas u objetos especiales) son una experiencia vital en el juego. Cada contrato es diferente, tiene una historia interesante detrás, diferentes objetivos y diferentes finales disponibles. Sin duda, la narrativa principal es lo mejor. Me tiraría horas explicando lo maravillosa que es. Solo debo decir que cada jugador la podrá valorar de una forma tras concluirlo. Lo cierto es que es una historia ligera, nada repetitiva, única, con personalidad, con hasta 36 finales disponibles según las elecciones de cada uno. Tengo un palabra para describir este supervideojuego: SUBLIME.",10,2020-11-15,PLAYSTATION 4,user

22schrosa,"I'm not going to lie, I went into playing this game hoping to be disappointed and dislike it. But I fell in love with it. My second favorite game of all time, behind Red Dead Redemption 2. The combat isn't great, but people tend to exaggerate how bad it is. The sound design and songs are great. The graphics as far as a 2015 ps4 game goes its graphics are good. It has one of the best worlds in video game history. The main story is pretty good. The characters are great. It has some of the best quest design and stories in video games both in the main and side quests. This is a top 5 game of the generation no matter who you are and comes second behind Red Dead 2 in my opinion.

Rarely can a game achieve such a masterful level of storytelling, unforgettable characters, excellent side missions and a truly magnificent open world. It's dense and begging to be explored. Every character looks and feels different, and have their own unique personalities. It's a testament to CDPR, one of the world's leading developers. I never thought I would say that a game could surpass The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time as my #1 favorite game, but I think Witcher 3 has done it.

Aún así, no es compleja de seguir y se hace muy amena. Las secundarias son casi mejores que la historia principal. Increíble lo que hace este **** banda sonora es impresionante con toques muy épicos cuando llega el momento. El mundo abierto es enorme y puede llegar a sobrepasar, pero si sabes gestionarlo e ir organizando poco a poco el viaje lo vas a disfrutar. A mi me ha parecido una pasada, sobre todo a nivel de exploración. El combate es muy simple, pero en la simpleza es dónde radica la calidad.

Sensou,"I might be late to the party and that's might be the reason I dislike the game. I don't get the hype and all the praise that people are talking about this game. Tried it on 2022 when I bought PS4 and somehow I couldn't get myself to push forward with this game. I'm trying to give it another try at the end of 2023 but stil, It feels clunky to me and not engaging. Give it another try this year and still the same thing, I cannot understand what's good about the game. One thing that I assume would be the cause is due to my expectation that this is an action game which is not. This game is heavily an RPG game with some crafting + narrative driven. To put into perspective, I dislike RPG game, except JRPG (Yes, I'm one of the people that believe RPG and JRPG are two separate genre because they are totally different). Well, The Witcher 3 is just not my cup of tea and I guess it's fine.

На прохождение основного сюжета, сайд квестов(думаю почти всех), фарма всех локаций(вопросиков) ушло 103 часа. Закончил 37 уровнем. Игра до сих пор красивая, да чуть мыльная, но локации с их ветром и ""дышащим"" миром - радуют. Дизайн и тд тоже класс. Музыка в игре очень хорошая, улучшает погружение, и наша ""славянскоксть"" нравится. Боёвка прикольная, нравится, все мутагены и знаки позволяют играться. Сюжет добротный и интересный , до Скеллиге - среднячок, дальше, когда появляются гробницы и Эльфодвиж уже интереснее. Дикая Охота-топ. Прекрасный монструозный стиль гига чадов, вайб и предыстория. Персонажи живые и интересные, отсутствие цензуры одобряем. Сайды тоже Крутые, хэнд мейд почти все, но мало какие именно цепанули. Закончил игру на отличную концовку с Цири. В Политике выбрал Роше.

Anything involving boats is a gigantic PITA. Just skipped anything boat-related. The skill points system is insanely stupid. If you're even a few levels above your current quest, then you're rewarded with next to no points. This effectively de-incentivizes doing any quest that you're overlevelled for.

История, персонажи и мир погружают в себя настолько, что хочется буквально жить в этой вселенной. После основной игры я с головой погрузился в дополнения ""Каменные сердца"" и ""Кровь и вино"". Они не просто дополняют историю, а открывают целый новый пласт приключений, эмоций и великолепной **** Projekt Red задали такую планку качества, что превзойти её будет невероятно сложно. Но именно это делает ожидание ""Ведьмака 4"" столь интригующим. Кажется, что перед разработчиками стоит практически невозможная задача: сделать что-то ещё более впечатляющее.Хочу выразить огромную благодарность за эти сотни часов удовольствия, глубокую и трогательную историю, а также потрясающий геймплей.

Crantonius,"Arguably the greatest RPG of all time. Firstly, the game is undoubtedly a stadound due to the main protaganist, Geralt of Riva, a true all men want to be him and all women want to be with him character. This is then built upon by a plethora of amazing supporting characters set inside a truly unique and massive world. The replayability of the game is for me what makes it truly great. There are so kany RPG's that I would consider a 10/10 on the first playthrough but have no replayability value - This is different. Over the course of the games lifespan i have replayed the game 4 times, each as enioyable as the last. Closing point - The DLC's. More than likely the greatest DLC's of all time. One being basically a standalone game in its own right. Forced to give a 10 here but my true rating is 9.5.

Ed1k,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is not just a game, it is a true masterpiece that remains the benchmark for RPGs years after its release. CD Projekt Red has created a world that is so alive and atmospheric that it seems as if you are really traveling through Velen, the streets of Novigrad or the wild mountains of Skellige. The plot is one of the best in the gaming industry. Every quest, even the smallest, is filled with a deep story and choices that make you think. And the main line with the search for Ciri and the fight against the Wild Hunt is an emotional rollercoaster that keeps you going until the very end. The gameplay is not far behind either. The combat is smooth and dynamic, alchemy and magic add depth, and the possibilities for customizing Geralt - from equipment to play style - make each passage unique. But the real magic is the modifications created by the community. From cosmetic changes to new stories - mods allow you to expand the already huge world. Want to change the combat system? Add new costumes? Or even get additional stories? All this is available thanks to mod support, and it's truly impressive. Also, every detail in the game looks thoughtful. From the dialogues to the little things in the world - everything speaks of love for detail and respect for the players. The soundtrack deserves a special applause - the melodies are so atmospheric that you want to listen to them even outside the game. The Witcher 3 is not just a game, but a phenomenon. It offers something for everyone: a rich storyline, an open world, customizable mechanics, and a community that continues to improve it today. If you haven't played it yet - be sure to fix it, because this journey with Geralt will be remembered forever.",9,2024-11-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user

th3reaperskull,"It's impossible for anyone not to recommend this game, and anyone who says otherwise is completely mistaken and has a distorted perspective **** game.I say this with all certainty, most of the negative reviews only concern themselves with a single point of the game ""the combat"" others find the ""combat difficult and not noob friendly"" which doesn't make sense, because the game's combat is the most simple as it **** I put this in this way because they find the shared analyzes ridiculous, since the games that have come out since the Anthem Syndrome will only come out with poorly made games, without any structure in the story, characters with weak backgrounds and the Witcher not only the game but its entire universe They deserve to be highlighted as excellent games to set an example **** game or what makes it good.(History Overall and Characters)- From start to finish, I'm speechless, every choice you make, good or bad, has an absurd impact on the characters and the ending of the game itself, the Witcher 3 is the continuation of the previous games where it brings back notable characters from past **** game manages to convey the same feeling of being present in that world, of actually living the daily life of a witcher and of making tough decisions at critical moments. Only reading lovers could understand this feeling of truly entering this world.Only reading lovers will be able to understand this feeling, we end up feeling like we are really inside the story of the characters and the world itself, it's not for nothing that great games end up being based on Books already **** despite this, we ended up becoming interested in wanting to know more about the game's world, I was one of the people who fell into Witcher 3, I never got to touch 1 and 2 but I had already seen something, and when it's finished I will definitely give it a leap forward in previous franchises, I don't expect the same level as Witcher 3.{Combat and Mechanics}The combat is not very challenging, with just a few hours to minutes you can understand the basic mechanics, which end up being a reason for many to ignore the game, despite this I found the style of combat that the game gives us interesting. The character's movement ends up being buggy and not synchronized with the game's NPCs, often when dodging or attacking an NPC who is in stun, you still take damage even if the enemy NPC is doing an attack animation and it is cancelled.Even so, I don't find combat boring, I always experiment with ways to try and make it fun, always using combat tactics to simulate that I really am a real witcher.{Graphics and performance}The graphics and the world itself are full of details and things to do, compared to some games where they make you walk 500 km to do something and I find it boring, if I walk around the game every now and then there is always some interaction or special event with someone NPC leaving more and more curiosity and desire to explore new rare or unknown interactions.Performance, although some have reported problems even with PCs at the same level as mine, I have never encountered problems resulting from poor performance, crashes, corrupted saves, etc.I even consider Witcher 3 to be an excellent, very well optimized game.(Side Quests and DLC)In some games we can consider that the side quests are literally to fill you up and make you waste game time, but in this game all the side quests are for you to do, I believe that the contract missions where you have to kill some monsters are not have so much impact but completing missions will give you the possibility to interact with new characters that can affect the main quest in general. Honestly, I wasn't bored with the side quests, which even surprised **** game's expansions are excellent, nothing to criticize them for, and I'm sorry they didn't make an expansion of the Blue Mountains area where at the end of the Bloody Baron's quest he ended up heading off with his **** the game, stop being silly about the combat, if you think the story is horrible, start considering reading some books and opening your mind on that aspect.",8,2024-08-07,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The story in some of the side quests were really interesting and touching, in some not so much. I would say the story of the game is about 7/10. I played the game at the hardest. The level design is bad. At the start, it was super hard to do something, but after 10 or 20 missions I improved enough to have enjoyful experience in gameplay. However, after a while, I understand that the gameplay mainly consisted ""dodge"" + ""attack"". The mechanics of bomb was not comfortable to use. You would iterate all the possible variants to search the one you want. Gwent was really fun. I plan to play this game again, in the future; but before that I want to read all Witcher books and play first two Witcher games. By the way, I suggest playing game in the Normal or maybe in Hard, but not Very Hard definitely because the hardness does not add more gameplay tactics. The enemies become just sponges.",6,2024-07-04,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Antoine0912,"The Witcher 3, le roi du rpg moderne, celui qui a été maintes et maintes fois copié mais jamais égalé. Après 39h de jeu pour finir la quête principale, je donne mon verdict sur ce jeu. Alors commençons immédiatement par son point fort : l’histoire et la narration, je n’ai jamais vu pareille attention aux détails, les décors, les pnj des villes et surtout les personnages avec qui on a interagi nous racontent tous une histoire crédible, prenante et agréable à suivre. Dans ce monde désolé par la guerre, les décors sont splendides ce qui transforme l’exploration et le transport à dos d’ablettes en un road trip à Velen, Novigrad ou Skellige. Une immense plaine, une grande ville et un archipel nordique voilà ce qui compose cette aventure et comment dire, la diversité rend encore plus belles notre aventure avec Geralt, qu’est-ce que j’ai aimé ce monde. Deuxième point fort de ce jeu et pas des moindres, les quêtes toutes aussi bien écrite de la principale à une simple quête secondaire (le Baron Sanglant, le ptit chien ou les démolisseurs de statues du sang ancien sont mes préférés ). Quel plaisir ce fût de suivre ces dizaines d’aventures. Enfin dernier truc, la BO est aux **** oignons avec ses airs de l’est quel plaisir pour les oreilles durant notre aventure avec le sorceleur. Passons très rapidement aux quelques **** défauts avec en mode normal, un système d’alchimie tout à fait négligeable, un système de craft inutile dans mon aventure et un jeu un poil long donc faire attention au sentiment de lassitude car pendant une quinzaine d’heures on a l’impression de ne pas avancer (à l’inverse des dix dernières qui sont incroyables). Je vais conclure en une phrase, jouez-y, c’est un classique du jeu vidéo, il faut l’avoir fait.",8,2024-03-08,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The side quests are also amazing, they're natural and not forced and give you all choices on how to approach them. Gwent is also a card game within that is unbelievable. I once jumped onto Witcher and spent 4 hours playing Gwent in a tavern in Novigrad and I loved every second of it.

Koukaburra,"This is such a great entry into the series of games. I am a fan of open world games and what a lot of games in the genre do is that there is either no structure/story or too much that things are hindered heavily unless you progress the story. I found the balance in this game to be great and fitting to the fact that you're a monster hunter and have to roam around a fight monsters. The story itself is great and the cast of characters are all compelling to the point I felt awful when some of my actions had terrible consequences later on. With that being said, when it comes to gameplay it does get a little repetitive and mashy. Sure, you'll have to consume a potion every once in a while but that is occasionally and can only be done outside of battle. For most engagements though, you can just attack a lot and use magic occasionally. This game is great and is carried by a very strong story/plot and world building. The gameplay is a little repetitive and straight forward seeing as witchers are super humans that have witcher radar that helps them to solve all their problems. Overall a great and immersive game.",8,2024-01-27,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The game presents players with morally ambiguous choices that have far-reaching consequences, adding depth and complexity to the narrative. The characters are well-developed and memorable, with their own motivations and conflicts.

Dron_Art,"Ох, даже не знаю с чего начать, в этой игре почти всё прекрасно, очень хороший сюжет, великолепная музыка, лор игры невероятен и продуман, очень много интересных и что самое главное уникальных побочных квестов. Я считаю это лучшей игрой в своём жанре. Ещё и следует упомянуть длс к игре которые могут конкурировать с многими полноценными играми. Минус только за задание с ведьмачьим чутьём, слишком много заданий к которым подводят одинаковым образом. Из минусов мне ещё не очень понравилось времяпровождение на Скелиге, там как по мне самый слабый сюжет всравнении с тем же Веленом, но музыка прекрасна так же. Как бы не хотел, но не могу эту игру оценить на 100.. чисто хочется сказать что она идеальна, но на деле есть проблемы технические, встречаются они во всей игре довольно не редко. Ну и то что дана зачастую просто иллюзия выборов. Но даже так как по мне эта игра данный момент одна из лучших если всё таки не лучшая во всей индустрии. 93/100",10,2024-01-18,PLAYSTATION 4,user

MaxieZeus,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a sprawling epic that has left an indelible mark on the RPG genre, celebrated for its expansive open world, engaging quests, and memorable characters. However, the game is not without its share of criticisms, particularly in its gameplay mechanics and the length of the main **** game's greatest strength lies in its rich tapestry of quests. The side quests, often as intricate and compelling as the main storyline, create a vibrant world filled with moral quandaries, political intrigue, and emotionally charged moments. Each quest feels meticulously crafted, presenting players with choices that reverberate through the narrative. The depth and complexity of these quests contribute significantly to the game's immersive quality, ensuring players are drawn into the world of The Witcher 3.Moreover, the characters in The Witcher 3 are a testament to masterful storytelling. Geralt of Rivia, the stoic yet charismatic protagonist, leads a cast of characters with nuanced personalities and compelling backstories. From the sorceress Yennefer to the bard Dandelion, each character feels like a living, breathing entity in a world teeming with life. The relationships and interactions, both friendly and adversarial, are a testament to the game's narrative depth.However, The Witcher 3 falters when it comes to the variety of gameplay mechanics. The combat system, while initially satisfying, can feel repetitive over the course of the game. The reliance on a small set of combat moves and the predictability of enemy encounters can detract from the overall experience. The lack of diversity in gameplay mechanics becomes more apparent as players progress, potentially diminishing the sense of excitement that should accompany late-game **** of the game's major drawbacks is the prolonged main story. While an expansive narrative is often a strong suit for RPGs, The Witcher 3's main story can become overly protracted. The seemingly unending search for Ciri, though initially captivating, can feel like a drawn-out affair. The quest's length may lead to moments of player fatigue, especially when side quests often offer more immediate and gratifying experiences. The balance between the main story's urgency and the expansive world's distractions could have been more finely tuned to prevent narrative fatigue.Additionally, The Witcher 3 simplifies certain RPG mechanics, a decision that has both positive and negative repercussions. On the positive side, it makes the game more accessible to a broader audience, eliminating potential barriers for newcomers to the genre. However, for seasoned RPG players, the simplified mechanics might feel like a step back, robbing the game of some of the depth and complexity that defines the genre. The streamlined nature of the RPG elements might disappoint those who relish the intricacies of character development and choice **** conclusion, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a triumph of storytelling and world-building, with quests that leave a lasting impact and characters that resonate long after the game concludes. However, its gameplay mechanics, characterized by a lack of variety, and the extended main story can be significant detractors. The simplification of RPG mechanics, while enhancing accessibility, may not appeal to RPG purists. Despite these drawbacks, The Witcher 3 remains an exceptional experience, offering a world that's as captivating as it is vast, and a narrative that's as emotionally resonant as it is expansive.Message ChatGPT…ChatGPT can make mistakes.

greentolar,"I saw my friend playing a game and tried it for a hour so I found it interesting and bought it myself. But for a few hours I got frustrated. Like someone already said there you feel so heavy in combat except dodging. Moves are like you are glued but suddenly so fast lol Then you can use spell you are dead. Riding a horse and it moves are mess too in similar way. I thought Im that clumsy but compared to another games this is mess. Invetory is labyrinth of the chaos. Ok but thats technical problems in some way. Another thing is NPCs. There are two types-frustrated ones with no hope and macho like I have been everywhere and knows everything with tons of useless dialogues to spread their personality or some not interesting info. Story is fine and deep but with dialogues and NPCs like these not really. World is fine feels living. But in Skyrim and Gothic for example you know you are in one cultural region so know the scenery,people and houses is very similar or same. There are many historical lands but feel very similar. Most annoying thing is when you pull up sword in city and its auto considered as a crime. And in terms of RPG its not really RPG but mainly its there to tell you a story I think. For first look its amazing if you get more into it its hard because of fighting system,boring because dialogues and annoying because of how story feels long. Music is also not that epic for game of this type.",4,2023-10-03,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Sicarius089,"This game is in a league of its own. Even on my second play through I'm discovering new things and side quests that I had missed the first time round. Side quests in this game should be the standard of side quests, one series of side quests is basically bare knuckle fighting, one of the first fighters I challenged asked for a favour that I would throw the fight because he had a family to look after. Rejecting his request and beating him, I was able to approach him and talk to him where as the player I could give him money out of the ""goodness"" of Geralt's heart. This is the tip of the ice berg of how in-depth this game is with the plethora of choices you can make that affect the overall world, some choices can lead a village to damnation or it's salvation. In the tutorial area on my second play through I came across a father whose child had been killed by wolves, shortly after leaving his house I came upon the wolves and I too was killed, given how the save works in this game I spawned to just before I approached the house of the father who had lost his child, so wanting to bring justice I went to speak to the Dad again, only to find out that this time the Father had been killed and the child was left an orphan. Again this is the tip of the iceberg of what a player can come across. Exploration rewards the player with experience to level up, loot that can be traded for money (which you will need) gwent cards (which is an addictive game when you understand it), swords, bombs, crossbows, potions, decoctions, armour, as well as diagrams for each of these so you can create new gear; as well as finding bestiary info (to help give you knowledge in what's best to kill a particular enemy). Assigning mutagens is a great way for customising the player experience for how they want to play, if they want to focus on attack they can build up their strength with defence, if they want to be all rounded they can assign mutagens to increase attack, defence, signs (magic) as well as inventory weight capacity. Exploration also rewards the layer with useful items such as equipment for Roach (Geralt's horse) so that you can increase the weight capacity as well as Roach's effectiveness in galloping as well as resilience to fear. You thought that was it? No, there's ruins to explore where Gerald can lift the curse or if he makes a mistake this can lead to the downfall of someone much later in the game. There's monster nests that can be destroyed, the monsters range from water creatures, giant centipedes, nekkers, giant spiders, giant insects, etc some of which if cleared it will cause a return of the human populace to that area. There's underwater exploration as well as a potion to increase underwater breathing. The DLC's just open up the game a lot more and one dlc in particular depending on the outcome changes the circumstances of where Geralt is on the next play through i.e. originally starting off you're in Karen Morhen, whereas depending on the dlc outcome you will start elsewhere and have to find out how to reach your objective (not gonna mention spoilers). Combat is really satisfying when you get used to it, which doesn't take too long, especially when you start increasing the signs. Story was also pretty solid, one aspect I really love was how CDPR blended a fantasy game with basically a detective mode (Witcher senses) as this creates a whole other layer of depth and tests the intuition of the player. There's just way to much to say about this game, with the PS5 version of this with more added content, it's definitely a Masterpiece, unfortunately that word is overused in fandoms but here it's completely justified.",10,2023-07-28,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Now retired I still play 6 hours a day. Witcher 3 is the best game I ever played. It's not my favorite to play, and it's not the most fun or anything. But all things considered; acting, visuals, atmosphere, story, etc - it scores 8s, 9s. and 10s in every category. There's a few small problems here and there, but no other game ever got so much right. Add the fact that there's zero DRM from CDPR and it's just icing on the cake.",9,2023-07-25,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Beautifulyinsan,"the word this game takes to heart is investment, they created a weird that is filled to the brim with things for immersion, the politics, the people and how they will even share there opinions on what is happening, as people would in real life, you meet an emperor as he requests you to find his daughter, but he only cares just because he is his daughter, meaning that he needs someone to follow and become leader, Geralt(who you play as, and the person on the greatest cover art of all time) only accepts to do it because he just wants her to be safe, because he knew her since a young child just learning to just pick up a sword. Geralt himself just wants to do as much as he can to stay out of it, as a witcher he shunned for being a mutated freak, he just believes he can only play his part. the story and characters along with the world you walk through is so lived in, fully realized to build this fantastical, beauty but yet so real world. one moment you may be helping a man find his wife, to then find out that maybe all of it could be staged, but or is real, you really never know cause the quests always present a possible choice, you never know, to then accidentally find a ruined building with a cyclops around there just roaming the area for you to fight and take down, and once you take him down you can reap the rewards which so happens to be the master-crafted version blueprint of one of the best armor sets in the game. the sense of wonder, excitement and terror for what ever new thing you might find, like a new side quest or new cave or treasure to collect. the amount of monsters with a WHOLE FREAKING bestiary to read and look at the many monsters of the game, read on little details with a whole page to look at and the main reason to read it, to find out a monsters weaknesses which are very conveniently showcased. the combat, while ""generic, as I will use lightly"" makes sure that at the heart of it is strategy, using the right damage oil on the right enemy, what bomb to use at this moment, when to swing, not dark souls but it gets challenging, but never impossible as I decided to play on hard, to then eventually change it to very hard(death march) when I got a grasp **** amount of the enemies and wanted more of a challenge and that is what I played the most on. the reason that makes the game challenging is the enemies, they will do what they can to overwhelm you, or use a couple tricks they can have up there sleeves, a great example is the werewolf, they are already rather aggressive, but around lower the 40% of health loss they will roar and start to consistently regenerate heath which puts you in the possession to be as aggressive as they are, which means reacting to his fast swings and chasing him down if he runs away, a basterdly foe, but a lot of fun to fight.. plus no one fight in the game takes to long before it might get stale, they have the perfect energy to keep the pace going of any fight whether or not it is a game of patience or reaction and time. plus the kind of experimentation you have in the skill tree is just the coolest, specialize in Igni and Aard just because, sure why not. or just be raw straight physical sword damage, absolutely. and I believe the most important part to talk about is the games incredible storytelling and the incredible story. the writing making each individual aspect of there character developed as a true identity and facet of everything they do(no spoilers). you feel for what they do because it all comes back to what people would do in real life and the this is what these characters do, more then this is what happens in the story, which is the best kind of character writing. emotional choices over understandable choices, this game will make you see the kind of person you are on the spectrum, and then you get to see the results of YOUR actions, and also how you influenced other characters actions to change there ways or indulge or accept what they are, for the better or for the worst on both ends. the choices you make can make the player terrified of making the wrong choice, and hoping that it could have the best outcome. But I will not spoil any of the story, I really only did that when I talked about the politics, because there is so much game that all must play to see, to watch come down, and wash away the player and envelop and enjoy, with the amount of stuff to do, from rather pointless stuff to do like go to a brother and get laid with which wastes your coin, to LEARNING A WHOLE CARD GAME MADE JUST FOR THIS GAME, called gwent which is way to complicated to explain, but collecting cards to make your deck more powerful by defeating other players is just the coolest hobby to just include for fun, and it is so well designed that it is so hard to believe it is just a sure why not for the game. it exceeds expectations of just being an RPG but an experience, This is one of the greatest games of all time. and one of my top 10 favorite games of all time.",10,2023-07-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user

ZXSth,"Every bit of critical praise you've heard about this game is completely valid. The Witcher 3 has just about everything - an extremely compelling narrative, a solid character progression system, and many opportunities to make meaningful choices that affect your world. It is extremely engaging, and will grab hold of your attention without letting go. Of particular excellence are the number of shockingly interesting side quests, along with an open world that offers so many opportunities to explore and gain power, but is also able to be almost entirely ignored if you simply wish to focus on the narrative. Perhaps this game's sole flaw is its so-so combat and movement. Geralt, the game's main character, sometimes can feel a bit stiff to control, and combat, while not at all bad, seems to pale slightly in comparison to similar action RPGs. However, this feels like the only real area of criticism I can give this game beyond an understandable (and only slight) lack of replay value, in my opinion. As stated earlier, the Witcher 3 is phenomenal. If you have not played it, and want either a solid RPG or a gripping narrative, this should be at the top of your list.",9,2023-02-04,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Shend,"This is one of those games that I feel is not for everyone, but those who enjoy it will find it to be one of the best games they've ever played. The story is amazing. I have to be honest, its not on par with something like The Last of Us or Uncharted in terms of animation, voice acting and performances, but that's mostly because this game is much longer than the usual story driven experience, so the reused animations are forgivable. In fact, this game is probably longer than the entire Uncharted series, not even including the two DLC's which individually are longer than most games. There is so much story in this game; so much content, and yet almost all of it is high quality. It's been said a lot, but some of the side quests in this game have better plots than most entire main stories of other games. The narrative is a major part of the game, and the deep and immersive lore and worldbuilding really contributes to that. This is a game that takes place in a world that has existed long before you, and there's so much history to discover. The rest of the game is just good or great. Ill be honest, it doesn't have the best combat, or the best puzzles, and I think the biggest problem I have is how terrible the movement controls are, but all these annoyances pretty much evaporate when you think back on the game. All you remember is exploring a huge and intricate open world, discovering things, making decisions, and OH. Did I not mention the decisions? This game is maybe the biggest argument for the novelty of videogames as a medium for storytelling. The player has a significant influence on the story, ranging from which romantic interest the protagonist ends up with, to your relationship with your child, what side characters live and die, and even who wins the war. The choices are really well represented as being gray in morality, and with complicated, unforeseeable consequences. Not only does this add a lot of replay value to the game, but it makes the story much more personal, and the consequences are much more weighty when you know that people died because of you, not because of the plot. Overall, this game is maybe a 4/5. But the story and world are so great that it completely overshadows any flaws with the gameplay. Its an easy 5/5.",10,2023-01-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Crimson9,"The Witcher 3 does one thing exceptionally well: writing! The sidequests in particular have an extraordinary level of quality and quantity, and together make this game exceptionally immersive. The main story doesn't quite reach the level of writing of some of the side content (especially the Baron's plot), but its still solid. The world and the music are also exceptional. However, the game still gets a 7. Ultimately, the gameplay is 20% dialogue, 20% traversal, 60% combat. The dialogue is great but its not like this is a CRPG of old which provides many branching decisions. The world is beautiful and full of lore and consistency in world building, but the traversal is not involved whatsoever. The combat is very clunky. This is a looong game, and the gameplay is the main focus. So while the writing is exceptional, I can't give this game more than a 7 given how poor the gameplay is.",7,2022-12-12,PLAYSTATION 4,user
RolandOG,"Having played through three times- as well as those in-between the years partial playthroughs that tend to happen- including both expansions, I can say with absolute certainty that the Witcher III is a complete masterpiece of epic proportions. I love every minute, every quest, character and detail. It is true that not everything is totally perfect, but it just doesn’t matter. When the PS5 version releases, I will play through again, starting from scratch, and then again on New Game+. There will never be another Geralt of Rivia in gaming. Not in today’s age, when old white guys would never fly. Especially the White Wolf. Relish it for all it’s worth and relish it some more. I love Ciri and would play a new game with only her, but Geralt is what powers the original games, just as he’s the central to the books. Geralt makes the game, and the Netflix show. Btw the game is better than the show so please stop trying to make the game more like the show.",10,2022-12-10,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Ginger_Avenger,"I hesitate to give anything a 10/10 because I always feel there are at least a few flaws worth a point or two off. This game is no different in that regard - the various role-playing systems are good, but have a bit of jank. The world is gorgeous but perhaps a but too full of things to do. Combat is good, but without the good chances for cheese you have, it would have been a bit stale after while. Still, the storytelling in this game, and the moral ambiguity of much of it, captivated me in a way few video games, or even movies or TV programs, manage to do. Hats off to the developers. The additional expansions were great, and I actually enjoyed Blood and Wine as much, if not more, than the main game (though I think you have to really like what the game gives you to do to want to play another 30+ hours of it).

CnPx98,"To start with the controls are horrible. They are easily some of the most messed up controls I have ever played a game like this with. Seriously what were you think when you made triangle, heavy attack, square light attack, circle jump and X to mount house??? But no option to even change them even in the Ps5 update. It's just disappointing. I can adjust to new controls when they aren't that bad but these ones were impossible to get use to because they are so obscure. When your swimming under water you hold circle to surface. CIRCLE! It's X in every other game in the world but it's circle in this game. Story is quite good. Downsides are missions have to high level requirements as it takes for ages to earn enough levels to do them. So you basically do 1 story mission, several side missions and stuff then another story mission. Why are sidemissions so forced in this game rather then just make them optional? This makes it hours in-between each story mission. Every single fight is like this. The boss fights all have health regen. Like all of them. It's annoying when you have no idea how well a boss fight is going. Am I half way through? Am I doing well or is he gonna fill his health bar 3 more times.

There are many positives about this game but something important to me is the side quests... the side quests in most games can be bland and long winded but i can say that in thw witcher, almost all of the quests were either fun or interesting or both. For example, there is one quest that you get later down the line which involves multiple different creatures working together, trying to ambush the witcher, as they see him as just a monster hunter, but the witcher can turn the tables on the leader if he has treated creatures kindly throught the game and i just think its a brilliant quest and really shows how good the devs are at story telling",9,2022-09-30,PLAYSTATION 4,user

BrianDavid94,"Quick background on me the reviewer, I tend to like single player games that is heavy on narrative the most. I also play a lot of racing games and use to play multiplayer games in my high school days but now that it's hard for me and my friends to find a good time to link up so now it’s more rare for me to get into a multiplayer game. Up to try any genre of games and sometimes I find something new that I didn't think I'd like. I own a PC (built by me), Xbox One X, Xbox Series X, PS3, PS4, PS5, and a Switch. I prefer Playstation due to their focus on narrative games. For scoring, I’ll be using the Gameinformer review scale and of coursed influenced by my personal opinions. (10)Outstanding. A truly elite title that is nearly perfect in every way. This score is given out rarely and indicates a game that cannot be missed. The world feels so alive. Side missions feel like they are their own story. The attention of detail is just impressive. CD Project Red has a bright future if they keep this up.

You could argue the combat is a bit clunky, you could argue that the game takes a while to get ""good,"" but everything else about the game is so absurdly great that I don't even care. The game itself is an all-timer but the DLC's push it over the edge. Legitimately two of the best DLC's for any game ever, especially Blood & Wine. They add so much content to the game. The base game took me roughly 110h to play through, and I took my time with it. I didn't 100% it either. And we're not talking Ubisoft 100h either where half of that is just drivel. This is 100h of actual content, story, and intriguing side missions. There was still more to do. The two DLC's combined added another 50h give or take, and considering the deals you can find on the Complete Edition of this game nowadays with all the content, it's such a steal at this rate it's ridiculous.

camacusjamacus,"The worldbuilding in this game is very well done, and I love a lot of these characters. Geralt is a treat, and there are a bunch of great secondaries that really stand out. Most of the voice acting is very good or good, with a few of the normal cast that mar. The combat is solid and the leveling system is compelling with plenty of routes and playstyles. Though there are plenty of recurring things that wear thin: damageable materials, recap voices on loading screens, and poor horse riding to name a few. The story is great, though some of the final battles don't meet expectations. I'm especially impressed with the side quests as they often have unique and intriguing tales of their own; I finished all the non-DLC ones. I've never put so many hours into a single game, and it is a testament to its breadth and its quality. Even if it's not perfect. Gwent is awesome and I'm glad I was told to stick with it.",9,2022-06-21,PLAYSTATION 4,user

chrisdan23,"Mit dem dritten Teil der Witcher Trilogie liefern CD Project Red ihr bisheriges Meisterstück ab. Überzeugten die Witcher Spiele seit jeher als hervorragende Erzählung, bettet der dritte Teil die erzählerischen Qualitäten der Reihe nun in eine Open World ein, die ebenso neue Maßstäbe zu setzen weiß. Bei dem Irrwitz an Detailverliebtheit und Lebendigkeit, die bisher kaum eine andere Open World so realisiert hat, kann man ohne Probleme bis zu 100 Stunden Lebenszeit in der riesigen und unglaublich authentisch wirkenden Spielewelt des Hexers Geralt von Riva verbringen. Inkl. der DLC Erweiterungen, welche die Karte und den Content nochmals immens erweitern, können es dann gerne auch nochmal 50 Stunden mehr werden. Trotz auch klar auszumachender Schwächen, beispielsweise in der Charakterentwicklung und hier und da einmal etwas hakeligem Gameplay - im Großen und Ganzen überzeugt Wild Hunt auch hinsichtlich seiner Mechaniken. Das Kartenspiel Gwint wird vermutlich als das beste Minigame aller Zeiten in die Videospielgeschichte eingehen. Die größte Stärke von The Witcher III ist aber das Quest Design. Kein anderes Adventure oder Rollenspiel füllt seine Open World mit dermaßen konsequent hochwertigen Content. Nicht nur in den Hauptquests, sondern gerade auch in den Nebenmissionen, die der Hauptgeschichte so manchmal gar die Show stehlen.",10,2022-06-08,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Despite all that GWENT is the best thing I really love about the game which made me bought Thronebreaker.

""The Witcher III"" is easily the best game not only in 2015, it is one of the few very best games i have ever played. To write about all ~100 hours + that i have played through till finishing the story would need more then 1 page, so i try to be short as possible. Probably never before i was captivated by open world then in this game. It is huge. And i mean HUGE! There a tons of activities, and every one of them is interesting, it keeps you going further, explore and etc. Gameplay is outstanding. Fights are incredibly done, they are brutal, so as this world. Graphics are amazing. Music! What a score and especially during battles - great stuff. Voice acting was superb by all involved. Just to thing how much effort was put into creating every single thing and detail in this game is mind blowing. To be honest i wasn't a fan of ""Witcher II"", haven't even played the first one. But after finishing ""Wild Hunt"" i can safely say - count me in for (hopefuly) next installments. This is simply one of the very best games ever created. Overall, ""The Witcher III: Wild Hunt"" is a masterpiece. I do not use this word usually, but in this case it is the one that perfectly summarize this experience.

tsmith2001,"Exploration in an open-world setting, alteration of gameplay based on personal choices, and the main storyline accompanied by numerous side quests ultimately define an ideal role-playing game, also known as an RPG. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt encompasses these elements and takes them to the next level. The player progresses through the game as Geralt of Rivia, a monster-hunting Witcher who aims to rescue his former apprentice, Cirilla, from being captured by the Wild Hunt (an army of elves from another world) for her powerful Elder Blood. During the playthrough, the player is immersed in a vast, breathtaking world that almost feels alive where character abilities, craftable potions, and ranged weapons are utilized in combat. Relationships can be formed with detailed, engaging characters, even those who play minor roles in the story. The story itself relies on the decisions made throughout the game, no matter how small those choices may seem. Making these decisions not only connects one with Geralt emotionally but also arranges an unpredictable, unique playthrough in which the player is bound to face the consequences. Choosing which characters to kill, help, or become romantically involved with impacts the endings of quests and the storyline overall. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt isn’t the type of game where it’s explicitly stated which options are morally correct or not; the outcomes occur naturally and give one a sense of freedom with their choices. In her Game Informer article, Kimberley Wallace describes “how the writers are always one step ahead and [her] decisions are never safe; the shades of gray mean that [one may] never know who to trust, requiring [one] to think carefully about every situation” (2015). This perfectly embodies the importance of the decision-making aspect of the game and how each choice is questionable and based on trust and beliefs. The characters are just as compelling as the story, as they are charming in their own way and completely believable. The player may feel emotionally impacted by the bonds that are formed, relate to their personalities, and can observe the in-depth character development of each person. The details and realism are recognizable in everybody, from Geralt to a minor character stumbled upon in an optional subquest. Gabriel Zamora expresses the richness of the characters in his own PCMag review, “Characters from the stories are fleshed out fantastically, often through their dialogue alone. Subtle gestures and facial expressions also breathe life into each personality, too” (2015). The individuality and authenticity of each person make them quite unforgettable, setting them apart from characters in other RPG games. Even so, listening to every character reminisce about their past can become tiresome and repetitive. Main quests and intensive side quests piece together the telling of a mesmerizing story. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt incorporates considerable detail in each quest, and the side quests themselves relate to the main story and its lore. They stray from typical side stories in other games, as they aren’t basic “recover this item” missions or ones where the player has to follow excruciatingly slow-walking characters. Completing these quests, along with the main story, allows one to play this game for hundreds of hours. However, undertaking these side quests can prove to be time-consuming, which may not be fitting for every player. Luckily, they’re not obligatory and the player can solely stick to the main story if they choose to do so. Overall, the player constantly wonders what will happen next, from the very beginning to the end. In essence, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt can be considered one of the most innovative, exemplary RPGs ever made. Completing the game might make one feel empty, but knowing they can replay it by making different choices or even to 100% it makes it worthwhile. Various aspects of the game create a memorable experience for anybody to enjoy.

AndreyCloud,"Great game overall. The multilayered story line based on your decisions is nutty, the number of endings and possibilities you can get is absolutely sick. Every choice and decision will have you second guessing yourself and never knowing the full outcome in the end. The side quests all matter in the main story as well, makes every bit of the game matter and will keep you occupied for hours on end. The combat is good, not great in my opinion, could have a lot more fluidity, feels very frigid and glitchy at times, like getting stuck on rocks or the interact is always busted. I encountered a lot of general glitches as well like game crashes, stuck in weird camera angles, npcs slow and not following me when needed, waymarkers not working at times, etc. All the story elements of this game are top tier quality, the mechanic and technical side of the game is a bit lacking and can be a lot better. If assassin creed type of mechanics and character control were implemented here it would have been a perfect 10/10.",9,2022-01-25,PLAYSTATION 4,user
FidelGastro,"Absolutely phenomenal game. There's almost nothing in the game that I couldn't give a rating of at least 9/10. The characters are excellently written, the game world is gigantic in size and yet it's full of things you can do. The game kept me entertained for almost four weeks. And I wasn't bored for even one minute of the time I devoted to this game. I think I could easily spend another ten or even twenty hours in the base game if I wanted to. I only encountered one bug in the entire game, and that was in the final bossfight against Eredin, when the camera got stuck at an angle away from the fight after going through a portal. The bug was resolved by loading the last saved position. Considering I played the game on PS5 I was very pleasantly surprised. I can't wait to play the two DLCs that come with the game. My expectations are high. Without further thought I give the game a very well deserved 10/10 !",10,2022-01-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The story, gut-wrenching and heartwarming all in one. The performances are amazing and feel raw and real.

Faxthtax,"Game is Epic enough. Story is good enough for me. What is not so great and REALLY drags the score down is the gameplay and controls. I can not remember the last time i played a game with such poor controls and combat as this one. Walking, running, riding horse is a pain. Geralt seem to go his own way at times when you dont walk in a straight line. idle controls are too sharp. No lag (which it should have had) and completely back to 1990´s style. Ugh. Riding your horse (named Roach, short for cockroach in real life) in the wild is painful in places where there is small obstacles. Roach is pretty dumb, instead of just do a small jump over it, he decides instead to come to a complete halt or run and go nowhere because of an invisible wall. And you bump into those, small obstacles or a tiny ledge keeps you walking without passing it. Combat was already outdated when the game was released. A very bareboned system. Hack, slash, dodge and hope for the best. Fighting groups is hopeless, they all come at you and you keep dodging until you find an opening. Devoid of choices and tactics, the combat is completely one-dimensional and dull / frustrating. Story wise its okay. Geralt is your usual tough guy. But overall a boring guy. Best and most interesting character is Ciri. During your playtrough there is too many characters you bump into, but neither has any develpment or are someone you care for. Inventory, menu are too large, clunky and messy with so much you do not need to care for. CPR did better story wise with Cyberpunk, but the game was a mess, and this is not unique either when you favour in the bugs. They are there. plenty-full. The TV-Show is a much better view. Much better character development and story. And you are much better off watching that than playing this mediocre game. CD Project Red along side **** Punch is one of the most overrated game developers out there. They have yet to impress me with a good title that gives a complete compelling package.",4,2022-01-13,PLAYSTATION 4,user

NickellPro,"Плюсы: + графика (очень красивая, целостная картинка, всё ещё держит планку по сравнению с новинками) + сюжет (увлекательное завершение истории Геральта из Ривии; игра самостоятельна, не требует обязательного прохождения первых двух частей чтобы погрузиться в сюжет) + персонажи (у каждого свои привычки, точка зрения, отношение к главному герою, история; с ними очень больно расставаться в конце игры) + открытый мир (сделан согласно книгам, очень атмосферно и детально; под каждым кустом что-то интересное, у каждого региона свои обычаи, люди, опасности) + побочные квесты (ни один квест не повторяет другой, это всё отдельные мини-истории со своим мини-сюжетом и героями (кроме поиска различных сокровищ, хотя и у них есть предыстория); некоторые побочные квесты напрямую влияют на основной сюжет, что приводит к определённым последствиям) + нелинейность прохождения (в игре 3 концовки, зависящие от выборов игрока на протяжении всей игры и побочных квестов; каждый побочный квест так же имеет несколько концовок, поэтому за одно прохождение увидеть все концовки квестов просто невозможно) + музыка (это настоящий шедевр, настолько атмосферную и завораживающую музыку услышишь далеко не в каждой игре; её хочется слушать отдельно от игры, она навевает разные воспоминания, хорошие и плохие) + потрясающие DLC (без них Ведьмак 3 раскрывается всего на 50%, это совершенно новые истории, персонажи, побочные квесты и локации, в которые хочется возвращаться снова и снова, будто погостить) + снаряжение (по миру спрятано невероятное количество брони, мечей, снаряжения для лошади, со своими сильными и слабыми сторонами, а также лучшая броня разных ведьмачьих школ, у которых свои разные техники ведения боя) Минусы: - огромное количество багов (это и летающие NPC, и неуправляемая Плотва, и бессмертные враги и т.п; хотя они и встречаются не так часто как могли, они крайне неприятны) - долгие загрузки (больнее всего умирать понимая, что сейчас придётся ждать длительную загрузку сохранения; тоже самое касается и перемещения между локациями) - заторможенная или ускоренная речь персонажей (в некоторых случаях озвучка не вмещается в действующий кадр, из-за чего её приходится либо замедлять, либо ускорять, что звучит очень нелепо, и иногда портит момент) Может не понравиться: = тот-же самый ""Гвинт"" (многим он не пришелся по вкусу, и часто раздражал игроков своей навязчивостью) = точки ""?"" интереса на карте (они все довольно однообразны, их исследование может быстро надоесть) Итог: игра невероятно огромна, наполнена интереснейшими квестами и увлекательным основным сюжетом, но многим она может показаться до боли скучной и унылой, из-за однообразных точек ""?"" интереса.",9,2022-01-07,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Radrin,"- Very well-written, in-depth characters and nuanced interpersonal relationships; - Great visuals for a huge open world game; - Fantastic music; - intricate story with some great plot twists and moral dilemmas; - Exploration/sidequest with a heavy focus on dialogue and narrative hooks which is rare to see in most open world rpg's since they're riddled with standard fetch/kill quests without anything interesting attached to them; - Stellar voice acting alongside natural, realistic and witty dialogue; - Compelling lore to explore; - impactful decisions that change the in-game world and story; - Great world design that hooks you into exploration; Absolutely tear inducing after I realized it was over, like finishing a really amazing book, movie or tv series. One of the greatest strengths of this game, besides the characters, is how they introduce diverse, (not copy pasted) carefully written narrative and story into side quests. The vast majority of content in this game feels unique and worth exploring even without any material gain, because while you might find 2 quests that involve “finding someone” which introduces you into the same core gameplay loop of searching for clues that lead to your objective and fighting/talking your way into completing it, one of the quests might involve trolls that kidnapped a shoe maker because they have an obsessive love for shoes and the other could involve a sweet old couple that, with further investigation, you might find, are cannibals that feed off of live people or corpses, and in both situations you are given options to decide what YOUR version of Geralt would do, with valid reasons for each choice available. The game could have benefitted from harder enemies and better, more diverse and impactful loot.(weapons and armors mainly.) As it stands there is no reason to use anything other than the witcher school armor/weapon sets since they're way better than anything else and it's a bummer because the weapon and armor design is really good in this game, so it would be nice to have some incentive to use other equipment. While the gameplay and animations are extremely smooth, playing Geralt, a witcher, might feel restrictive in terms of gameplay options, although I didn’t mind this compromise in favor of immersion. While the graphics were amazing for a game this size, the grass/plants/tree didn’t have volumetric textures. There is an argument to be made to shorten the main story for the base game as it can overstay its welcome at times, although most parts were very compelling. Best case would probably be taking parts of the main story and making them side content since they're still really good so cutting them completely from the game would be a disservice. It's worth mentioning that this game is very dialogue based and it goes usually goes into detail without cutting any corners so it will involve A LOT of reading, if you prefer gameplay that revolves around a lot of action instead then this might not be the ideal choice for you.",10,2021-12-26,PLAYSTATION 4,user

We get great music, and a massive world with garbage annoying swamp areas that can eat my ass, and a big awesome medieval city where the game improves massively. We also get memorable characters with awesome sex questlines :D CDPR creates all these things, all these ingredients for something potentially special, and throws them into this fu***** s*** game. The gameplay is so BAD. It is so pathetic, so worthless, so bad that I want CDPR to apologize to me. The gameplay is a fu***** hate crime. I'd rather get **** than play this combat ever again. CDPR messes up the most important part ****, the GAAAAAME. Why? Just seems like no-one seems to have fu***** bothered. I am utterly lost for words. The W in Witcher 3 clearly stands for Wfu***** terrible combat. But if we ignore that, even though how could we, is the game still good? Yes, in many ways. Is it the best game ever made? **** no.

Game of the decade for me, and only God of war comes close to me. The expansions add dozens of great hours to it and even in 2021 it makes almost all expansions made by other publishers look mediocre in comparison. You can get over 200hrs out of this game, with almost nothing of those hours being ubisoft style filler.

Zaicron,"Como já fazem muitos anos é impossível lembrar de tudo para opinar. Porem não deixa de ser um bom momento para dar nota, já que não existe mais a emoção do desconhecido. Lembro que eu achei a gameplay confusa e bagunçada no inicio, e se não me engano cheguei a falar que o estilo de combate era um lixo nos primeiros, mas isso pode ser em partes pq esse foi meu primeiro jogo da franquia e comecei direto na ultima dificuldade. Porem, depois de acostumar com o estilo, não tive mais problemas. O jogo estava bem difícil no inicio, se tornou tranquilo em algum momento e ali pelo lvl 15 o ficou fácil. Claro sou dos que explora cada canto e sai fazendo tudo que encontra pelo mapa com base em lvl, o que deve ter facilitado para o progresso do meu personagem. Sobre os termos técnicos não tenho o que falar, é tudo maravilhoso. A história principal é boa, mas mesmo eu gostando, não é algo surpreendente, porem quando coloca as histórias de todas as outras missões que vão surgindo pelo mundo conforme você avança, não tem como não se apaixonar pelo capricho. Você sente o mundo vivo e funcionando para além dos interesses do protagonista, tendo algumas histórias que são ão boas ou até melhores do que a principal. Em relação a mundo aberto acredito que the witcher deu uma aula sobre como um jogo deveria ser. Sei que o jogo possui pequenos problemas, mas não tem como olhar para a composição completa e não considerar perfeito.",10,2021-08-19,PLAYSTATION 4,user

There are also disadvantages, they are related to the technical execution of the game, however, against the background of the high quality of everything else, they are less noticeable: - stupid AI NPCs, as a result, a huge number of NPCs in big cities (Novigrad, Tussent) ruins the immersion. - A small number of different faces in NPCs, as a result, twins are constantly found, which may seem absurd and misleading. - Least significant disadvantage: bugs, in fact, the presence of bugs in the open world games is normal, The Witcher 3:Wild Hunt is no exception in this regard.",9,2021-07-22,PLAYSTATION 4,user

It’s a masterpiece, great story, characters that you absolutely relate with, romance, battles, bosses, crafting, NSFW content if you know what I mean, exploration, leveling, Roach the bugged horse (it’s a funny one, actually), a mini game that is called “gwent”, and ladies and gentlemen, you will be so addicted in gwent that you are going to play hours and hours before you go back to the main quests. Geralt is a legendary and famous Witcher (but not so much loved by the people), that is looking for a sorcerer called Yennefer, in order to check out your considered “daughter”, Ciri, a girl that both of them don’t see for years. They believe she might be in danger.

Vegito901,"Ok now I got to be honest in this one. At first I felt At the beginning I felt that the game was too overwhelming, too big and too adult for me because I came from Skyrim, and to make a comparison was impossible because they were the ''two greats'' of the genre. I watched an advice video about the game. When I came back I was excited, and when I left White Orchard.... 210 hours are the number of hours I have played. I've played the main campaign 2 times and I'm waiting for the next-gen update to play the DLC's again. The world of The Witcher 3, the Continent, is plagued with evilness, hunger, suffering, sadness and war, that's what you see, and the folklore and richness of the world will make all this stuff charming. Thanks to the huge amount of different and side quests, enemies, how the world reacts to you and your decisions (nothing to do with Skyrim by the way), the beauty of the game itself, the characters, the story, even the gameplay, everything! This game will catch you, and when you finish it you will realize that you played the best game ever. And that if you used your time for something worthwhile. 5000 characters are too few to be able to express all the love and respect I have for this game, all the affection I have acquired for the characters and how I enjoyed the main campaign. But maybe they are enough to talk about the DLC's. Hearts of Stone is fantastic and introduces you to one of the best villains of the saga of video games, I do not want to detail more because although it is worthwhile, what I want to talk more than anything is the second DLC. And even so, it's a sin not to buy the whole game. Blood and Wine... Imagine a place where you gather the most beautiful of French, Italian and Spanish culture. That beautiful music, those colors, that attitude of the inhabitants of Toussaint... after wars and suffering, after death, you arrive in a world full of life, wealth, abundance and nobility. Someone who has a strong European identity would cry from happiness if such a place existed. Toussaint is magnificent, and I repeat it because I measure my words, MAGNIFICENT. A year after playing the DLC I am still humming the songs, I even have them downloaded on my phone and know how to play them on instrument. I already loved The Witcher 3, it was already the best game I'd ever played in my life, and then came Toussaint.... It's a near perfect game. It's magnificent. It's wonderful. It's The Witcher 3.",10,2021-04-05,PLAYSTATION 4,user

jkuras08223,"The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt is the tip of the Iceberg of open world experiences. With a deeply engaging world and lovable characters. This game has everything you want in a story driven RPG. I played the Witcher 3 Wild Hunt for the first time ever in 2021 and it looks amazing for a 5 year old game. It also has one of the best story lines in a video game to date. Every Quest has different outcomes, even side quests. I have played 100 hours of the game and it has some of the best immersion in an open world game ever. The Cut scenes play a massive part in the immersion. The game feels lived in. This and Red Dead Redemption 2. This game has some of the best Characters that you care for deeply. This game puts you on an emotional rollercoaster with its 57 main quests and around 250 side missions. Every cutscene has a quest changing choice. It really is breathtaking. The combat is fun and I played the game on blood and broken bones difficulty and once you get past level 10 the game is easier. There are so many different types of swords and special swords you might have seen in past Witcher games. You can use spells that can be upgraded in a skill tree and each of them are used for different situations. You also use different environmental bombs that can help you fight certain enemies. The Witcher 3 also has some entertaining romance story lines that have multiple outcomes; the two most popular ones are Yennefer of Vengerberg and Triss Merigold. Which are both some of the best romance stories in video games. The end verdict is that Witcher 3 is one of the most ground breaking games of the Playstation 4 and Xbox one era and is a must play in my book and completely out does CD Projekt Red Cyberpunk2077 most recent release and I hope they can go back to the quality of the WItcher 3.",10,2021-02-17,PLAYSTATION 4,user

ankokukishijp,"I was really excited when I first got the physical copy of the game. It was well packaged and I could feel it, ""This is going to be one of the best games I will play!"". After playing games for decades I usually have this ""hunch"" whether I would like this game or not by seeing the cover of the game. I was mind blown the first few hours! The feeling was unique! I played many open world RPG and this is the first time I have seen the Story so well-developed! Not only that, the side quest itself is NOT a ""copy paste of go here, fetch that, return here"" type of lazy settings, it was well written and every interactions you had with this side quest, somehow affected the main story. Geralt the main character is also very unique and I could see this character serialized for a movie (it did). The world, the atmosphere was supportive enough to get you immersed in it. I was sure I would play this game for long time. So i thought. The ""Magic"" starts disappearing after the first 3 hours, then I was completely snapped out of Witcher's Charm after putting 5 hours. In total I have played about 12 hours and reached Novigrad halfway. What happened? I was overhyped. The story was well written, settings was well set. But that's it. Combat was just okay to get you going from one story to another story, it is clunky and boring tbh. Customization is quite limited. Outside of the main story, the environment feels very dead, you do not get many surprise element; although side quest is very engaging I'd still insist. Having skipped 1 and 2, i began to feel less and less connected as i progess further to the main character as more new terms and jargons been throwed in the main story. Combat became really boring after you figure out how to dodge enemies. Magic and Alchemy feels less impactful, its like just using an item from a paused-enabled menu. I can't explain very well, but overall I feel like this game may be rushed for some reasons. The pre-planning concept was well done; however execution of the development was all over the place. In conclusion, don't get me wrong, I think this game DESERVES a well-praised! The developer has put enough effort , time and expertise in creating such an amazing series! But the media has been over-hyping this in a sense it is like a bubble. I think this game is great but definitely not 9 / 10. A Fair judgment would be between 7 to 8 out of 10. To normalize this overhyped / overbubbled high ratings, please forgive me of giving this rating a zero because while I acknowledge the game's greatness, I want to be fair to all other gamers out there whom may have a spoiled experience because of the expectations of ""9/10"", ""GOTY!"", ""Masterpiece"" type of reviews being distributed all over the internet. You would be able to enjoy this game more with lower expectations. Do not fall into the same trap like me.",0,2021-02-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Aquelyras,The Witcher 3 is an Amazing Masterpiece from CDPR. This Game is the Best of all Time for me. After i Started it in 2016 and didnt liked it i replayed it in 2017 with over 200 Hours of Pure Love for this Games Story and Characters. Everyone who didnt Played this Game Yet. Should Spend this 10-20€ and get it. And everyone should get the GOTY Edition the 2 DLC Heart of Stone & Blood and Wine are one of the Best DLCs every Created. Both DLCs add arround 15 Hours of Story and would be as a Standalone better than 90% of the Full Priced Games. 10/10 Greates of all Time,10,2021-02-06,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Eienmatt,"I finally completed Witcher 3 after trying to get into it when it was released and again a year later. Having put well over 100 hours into it, i can say that it does some things well and does some things terribly. The best thing it does is create an open world begging to be explored. I so often enjoyed seeking out a ""?"" to find a side story, some treasure or a fun battle. It also has some great character development. I genuinely cared about several side characters and enjoyed seeing how my choices played out. The worst thing it does is in regards to it's battle system, item management and leveling system. The battle system is just... bad. It may have been good in 2015, but by 2020's standards, it's clunky, boring and repetitive. It also seems to want you to use magic and a variety of weapons but these are attached to ring selection systems that detract from the overall action. Item management is rough. The UI isn't great overall on the PS4 but trying to keep track of crafting, junk, collectables, consumables, etc, takes much entering/exiting of several menus and submenus. The levelling system is interesting in concept but starts to get boring about 40 hours in. The limited number of slots means that you really have to specialize, which isn't always great depending on the enemies you encounter. Further, it feels like the game wants you to try a few different Geralt types (speedy/tanky/magic/etc) but trying to do this requires rebuilding and reorganizing your character quite a bit. None of this is easy to do or convenient. Overall, i think this type of game must appeal to a certain type of gamer as the positive reviews really had me scratching my head as i tried over and over to get into it. I can say now that the game is probably worth $20 but was never worth full price. As well, if you feel like you're not able to get into the game, it probably won't change - even after forcing yourself to continue on just a little longer. i wouldn't spend time buying the add-ons as you'll be burnt out before you get tot them anyway.",6,2021-02-05,PLAYSTATION 4,user

U are utter garbage at the game and can’t beat it because you’re a loser. I saw one dude on here say go play shadow of mordor instead to see how a real game plays.. LMAO that game is batman arkham with swords, and it’s so unbelievably easy I can beat that game playing with my toes, blindfolded, facing away from the TV....with no sound. You my friend, just **** frozen poop nuggets. The story in this game is evolutionary and unpredictable, you can moprh your own path, some characters will not survive based on the decisions you make. You can screw a bunch of chicks in this game, kiera metz is a must. The var attre sisters are so hot hopefully we can have a threesome in the next game. The characters in this game are so amazing I feel like I know them in real life. The big open world is full of life so much side content, characters, and secrets hidden in all of the little nooks and crannies all over, and not just some boring depressing trash lifeless padded world full of nothing but mountains and tumbleweed like in a hideo kojima game, or a ubisoft game like assassins creed or watchdogs or something. The boss fights in the game are great and you have to be skilled to beat them, if you can’t beat them and instead come on here to complain about the combat.. it’s okay, just put down your controller, crawl into your corner and **** your thumb until u fall asleep because you are a droopy diaper baby.

It's a 2015 game and playing it still today, at the of 2020, can only be a wonderful experience in the fantasy world inspired by Andrzey Sapkowski. The game design and the different beasts made are very suggestive. I do not rule out the presence of bugs, some rare drop in fps or texture, as well as dropping objects and a difficult horse to control in tight places or in the presence of obstacles but they do not compromise the gameplay. The story, indeed, the stories, are well detailed and intersected with each other and your choices have multiple effects on all people and the events connected to them.

TragicShow,"The Witcher 3 is quite simply a great game. Not only is it great in its own merit, but when compared to the last entry, there is little comparison as TW3 has improved on almost every aspect. I have put 60 hours into this game, and it hasn't crashed once. Something that took me away when playing this game is how truly unique each of the side quests are. In typical RPGs, the general rule for side quests is to go to point A, kill everything/retrieve item, and then return. The Witcher makes every side quest feel unique with interesting characters and objectives, and it manages to keep them all interesting. I only have a few gripes with this game; including the inability to wear helmets and the severe lack of armor variations. These of course are very minor complaints, and it wouldn't be normal for Geralt to wear helmets anyway. The combat can also get a bit repetitive, and it is generally a lot easier than the previous game in all regards. The music selection during combat is also very limited. My main issue with the game, however, is the gear system. Gear which you get is automatically leveled to whatever level you are when you obtain it. Meaning that if you get the legendary grandmaster witcher armor (which takes upwards of 10 hours to collect a full set), it is going to be totally obsolete after five levels. You also can't upgrade it, making it worthless if you choose to get it early on. If you decide to get it near the end of the game, it's also useless because you've already finished most if not all of the missions.",8,2020-12-20,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Quests like finding a pot for an old lady or some guys sheep or learning how to bow correctly are really dumb. The main story is pretty boring and most of the world all looks the same. The game railroads you into quests so exploration is discouraged. You do get to see **** in the game so maybe that is why so many thirsty nerds like the game.

Not quite the craftsmanship that Naughty Dog brings to the table in realism of performance, but the way stories unfold keeps you on your toes, feels organic, balanced, and incredibly dynamic. No side quest feels like a grind, they are genuinely thoughtful and intriguing.

assassinader200,"Posiblemente es el mejor videojuego que he jugado hasta la fecha. Cuando hablamos de ""The Witcher 3"" vemos al instante a un viejo brujo con el pelo cenicineto, con su hoja de plata desenvainada y ""bailando"" con monstruos. Esa imagen la transmite este videojuego. Empezaremos con la ambientación. El mundo del escritor polaco Andrzej Sapkowski es inmesno y aunque en esta entrega solo se desvela una pequeña parte parece que es gigantesco al mismo tiempo. Ciudades como Novifrado, Oxenfurt o Velén transmiten diferentes emociones. El cambio de paisajes y escenarios es increíble acompañado de cambios climáticos y de una banda sonora espectacular que también varia según la situación y el lugar. Es un mapa cargado de detalles, colorido y al mismo tiempo sombrío, lleno de paz y al mismo tiempo de crueldad. Sin duda l@s muchach@s de CD Project Red han estudiado al detalle la ambientación. Por otro lado tenemos una mejora en el combate respecto a ""The Witcher 2: Assassin of Kings"", nuevas animaciones, mas fluidez en combate y mas realismo son algunas de las mejoras. Además, cada combate parece ser único, los enfrentamientos con monstruos son increíbles y estos se complementan de diversas habilidades comprables con puntos de habilidad. Geralt de Rivia se encuentra en su madurez, es un personaje realmente elaborado hasta el último detalle. Es frío y al mismo tiempo romántico, audaz, cargado de una personalidad fielmente recreada como en los libros; es el brujo definitivo. El resto de personajes secundarios son también excepcionales y **** horas en representarlos. Lo que más fascina, a parte de su mundo, de la personalización de Geralt o su enorme bestiario, son las misiones secundarias. Si por algo podemos decir que es un gran juego es por esto. Cada misión secundaria es única, muy diferente al resto. En cada una aparecen personajes únicos, no NPCs aburridos. Los contratos de brujo, aparte de ofrecer generosas recompensas (espadas u objetos especiales) son una experiencia vital en el juego. Cada contrato es diferente, tiene una historia interesante detrás, diferentes objetivos y diferentes finales disponibles. Sin duda, la narrativa principal es lo mejor. Me tiraría horas explicando lo maravillosa que es. Solo debo decir que cada jugador la podrá valorar de una forma tras concluirlo. Lo cierto es que es una historia ligera, nada repetitiva, única, con personalidad, con hasta 36 finales disponibles según las elecciones de cada uno. Tengo un palabra para describir este supervideojuego: SUBLIME.",10,2020-11-15,PLAYSTATION 4,user

22schrosa,"I'm not going to lie, I went into playing this game hoping to be disappointed and dislike it. But I fell in love with it. My second favorite game of all time, behind Red Dead Redemption 2. The combat isn't great, but people tend to exaggerate how bad it is. The sound design and songs are great. The graphics as far as a 2015 ps4 game goes its graphics are good. It has one of the best worlds in video game history. The main story is pretty good. The characters are great. It has some of the best quest design and stories in video games both in the main and side quests. This is a top 5 game of the generation no matter who you are and comes second behind Red Dead 2 in my opinion. The Witcher 3 is just a master class and a great leap forward for the RPG genre and a 97/100 game (Tied for the highest score I've ever given a game).",10,2020-11-13,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Wwilliams23,"I bought Witcher 3 on release day in 2015, and put in over 200 hours, including both DLC's. I can now claim that it's one of the best games of all time. Rarely can a game achieve such a masterful level of storytelling, unforgettable characters, excellent side missions and a truly magnificent open world. It's dense and begging to be explored. Every character looks and feels different, and have their own unique personalities. It's a testament to CDPR, one of the world's leading developers. I never thought I would say that a game could surpass The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time as my #1 favorite game, but I think Witcher 3 has done it.

Fynngr,"Best game I have ever played. 400+ hrs in, halfway through my new game+, and I still find myself amazed with what this game has accomplished. There are slight inconveniences with the game obviously, but none are big enough to steer you away. Things like jumping and dodging being bound to the same button can cause frustration when trying to traverse while the game senses your are or potentially will be in combat. Things such as jumping over a ledge, climbing something or anything requiring you to jump, isn't possible when your controls switch from traversing to combat. Aside from that though, my list of ""complaints"" comes to an end. The story is amazing and always keeps you invested, with strong characters and dialogue that support the deep and often dark themes. Among the very long list of memorable characters that will follow me forward for years and years, a world so beautiful in its struggling, post-war shell of a former self manages to be one of the most engaging and memorable characters of them all and tells a story of its own to get stuck in. Deep, well thought out RPG mechanics, great storytelling, amazing characters, a world full of life while also managing to feel so barren of it (in a good way), and the coolest role possible for you to play in such a world - the Witcher!

The controls are bad and unresponsive, the simple act of facing a chest and pressing X to loot is a dreadful chore because it is super hard to get Geralt to aim the correct direction. A big disappointment because I liked the world, the characters, the story seemed good, the side quests are entertaining and the Gwent card game is a fantastic idea (easily the best thing in the game). If the controls were somewhat decent I would be on board but they are insultant to the point I couldn't go further and it is no like ""the game is old"" kind thing, Bloodborne was released the same year and still have one of the best combat system ever made.

brainstormer,"*Note: I'm reviewing the main game and the DLCs as well in this one review* The Witcher 3 is an outstanding game that delivers on so many levels. The amazing thing about this game is that even though the game is gigantic in scale and has many activities to partake in, these activities always feel meaningful and most of them are masterfully designed. And while this game is not perfect, it is still a great example **** created with care and hard work to deliver an unforgettable experience. The locations in this game are so carefully designed and filled with detail that causes the world to feel alive and believable. Whether it is the mountainous and snowy Skellige, the romantic and picturesque Toussaint or the swampy and muddy Velen, the game never fails to awe with how fantastically designed those locations are. And, with all of that, it provides great main quests and side quests that are filled with memorable and well told stories, and also with interesting characters. Choices greatly matter here, since they can heavily determine story outcomes and they enrich this already fantastic game with more replay value. It is known that the combat is not the game's strongest point, but it is still very fun IMO, albeit in some instances easy. And there are a plethora of creatively designed monsters to fight against, with everyone of them carrying different kinds of strengths and weaknesses, and with the help of potions, signs and bombs, there's multiple ways to fight enemies. Now, I've been showering the game with praise by now, but let's talk about some negatives. I found the boss battles of the main game to be incredibly dull and easy, which is a disappointment, however the game's DLCs have some awesome boss battles and they seem to overshadow my disappointment. There's also some story pacing problems that kind of hinder the experience slightly. And, there are some weird glitches, however, considering how huge the game is then that flaw is to be expected. Even though The Witcher 3 has some clear flaws, these flaws are easily overshadowed by the game's grand achievements. Also, the soundtrack of The Witcher 3 is beautiful; probably one of my favorite soundtracks out there. The soundtrack enriches the experience significantly, making the main story even more exciting to play. So, The Witcher 3 is a masterpiece.

drlowdon,"The third title in the action role playing series, players once again take on the role of The Witcher Geralt. As the game opens Geralt is informed by former lover Yennefer that the Emperor Emhyr wants to speak to him about finding his daughter Ciri, little does he know that a seemingly simple request will prove to be anything but… In all honesty it took a few hours for this game to really click with me but its interesting characters and story driven missions soon drew me in, and the way in which your actions really shape the world around you is unrivalled in gaming. Add to this some satisfying, if relatively simplistic, combat and literally hundreds of hours worth of content (even without the two excellent expansions) and you have one of the best RPGs available on any format.",9,2020-09-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user

adamlandos93,"I surprisingly just can't put this down. I've sank 50 hours in it and I am still playing every night for many hours. Its satisfying, violent, swift and punchy combat compliments the deep lore and many storylines that the player comes across in the form of side quests or as small stories during the main quest. What amazed me is that all these little storylines are so mature that even though this is a fantasy game, it makes you feel that its characters are very human; you can feel their pain, misery, desperation as well as their hope to make things better. The world is absolutely massive, but as wide as it is, it is also deep. I want to explore every nook and cranny because every spot hides something interesting. The leveling system is superb, with a lot of depth that presents itself slowly enough so that it can be digested and eventually mastered. Everything in this game has a ton of layers to peel and while it is a challenging game, it nonetheless makes you feel like a superhuman badass that goes from hunting haunting beasts to subtly uncovering the human inside of Geralt and everybody else in its diverse cast of characters. Sure, there are glitches and bugs here and there, but it's a humongous world with hundreds of quests, armor, weapons, etc and everything is done in a masterful game. Not only this is full of quality, but its quantity is probably unbeatable. I expect to put in this hundreds of hours, so its value cannot be underestimated. To conclude, this is one of the best games I've ever played; something I just can't put down even though I spent a lot of hours in this world. But, for me, the undoubtable star of the show is its densely layered, rich, mature and always-interesting storylines, side-quests included.",10,2020-09-15,PLAYSTATION 4,user

I picked this game up because I desperately wanted to play something at the time and the Witcher 3 was getting rave reviews left and right. So I thought, ""Why not?"", and picked it up. The Witcher 3 ended up being my favorite game of all time. This game absorbed me completely. It took me back to the days of playing the PS2 and not having a care in the world. A story that had me emotionally invested. Characters that I genuinely cared for. A beautiful and breathing open-world that is second to none. A combat system that was challenging but fair. This game has spoilt me. I don't think I will ever play a game again that will give me the same experience The Witcher 3 has. I really cannot recommend this game enough. If you have a system to play this game on, you need to buy it. If you don't have a system to play this game on, you need to buy a system. The Witcher 3 is a masterpiece.

INU4SH4,"Disclaimer: This was my first Witcher game and I played it a while ago and still do from time to time so my memory might not be the best regarding every detail of the game. The Witcher 3 is a fantastic medieval action game, even one of the best within its genre. Not only the main storyline is fantastic but at every corner, you'll find a new, exciting and fresh questline. If you're looking for an open-world game that will hook you for hundreds of hours thanks to its jaw-dropping world, lore, and creatures, you came to the right place. The characters have depth and human feelings, some monster hunting quests also come along with moral issues that will force you to make difficult decisions. What also makes this game so incredible is its protagonist. Geralt is one of the best video-game protagonists. He has it all. He suffered a lot to be the ""man"" he is, he fights discrimination and still helps humans despite it, he's sarcastic, charming, and fun to listen to and he's powerful to boot, but also takes a beating every-so-often despite his expertise. I've already talked for long enough about the story and characters. Now with the gameplay, graphics, and music. Visually, the world of The Witcher 3 looks gorgeous. Most of the characters and creatures look good and the medieval world and atmosphere are still some of the best. There are a few textures that didn't age that well and some visual bugs to be expected in such a vast world, but that will not be enough to ruin your immersion. Last but not least, the gameplay is one of the most refined you can fight in action-RPG games. Geralt is easy to control and the combat is never overcomplicated. With time and experience, you'll learn lots of small combat tricks and effective ways to fight every individual monster. Quite the rewarding experience. Now and then the combat has its faulty moments as well which can feel a bit annoying. Riding your horse can also be frustrating every now and then. Not a perfect game, but a very well-rounded open-world game and one of the most iconic and polished action games of its decade.",8,2020-09-01,PLAYSTATION 4,user

rambam100,"This is quite simply, the greatest game I've ever played. The story, characters, environments, monsters, dialogue,..... are all top notch. One of the only big things I would change, would be to make the combat a bit more inspiring and fast. Sometimes I felt this game would greatly benefit from a combat system like that of Middle earth shadow of mordor/war, which is fast and satisfyingly brutal,. But I'm not saying TW3 has bad combat, not at all, it is still good, it could just be improved. The one thing I really have to give loads of credit, are the locations in game. Skellige really gives **** impression of a nordic settlement, from the music to the accent of its inhabitants. And while Kaer Morhen may be small and have no villages, it is still my favourite area. It's music is absolutely fantastic and the fortress itself and the surrounding mountains and forests are absolutely beautiful. The characters Geralt meets along the way are deep and very well fleshed out. And some of the monsters Geralt fights are incredibly unique and terrifying. Leshens, Fiends, Botchlings, Hyms,... are just a few of the many enemies Geralt can encounter. I can't recommend this game enough.

Mr_Pozitiv,"Купил игру по скидке, думал что понравится так как имеет большие оценки от критиков и обычных игроков и у игры много разных наград, но в итоге спустя целых 20 часов проведенных в игре стало скучно. Много неинтересных, долгих и наскучивающих диалогов, не самая лучшая озвучка, а именно частые ускорения и замедления голосов (причем у значимых персонажей, а различные третьесортные npc такой ерундой не страдают, по крайней мере в десять раз меньше). Геймплей, а именно боевка не сложная, зачастую можно просто загнать противника в угол и бить его простой атакой (он ничего не сделает). Сюжет тоже пока не особо затянул. Особенно плохо играть в ведьмака после полного прохождения the last of us 2, игру с отличным и глубоким сюжетом, крутой графикой, с хорошей озвучкой (которая не страдает проблемами ведьмака) и игру с разнообразным и более интересным геймплеем. И кстати упоминания заслуживают очень долгие загрузки после каждой смерти и это в игре 2015 года в 2020 году, это прилично бесит. Но в ведьмак 3 есть и приятные моменты, а именно: большое разнообразие существ из славянской мифологии и красивые пейзажи во время закатов и рассветов. Но в общей сложности игра мне не особо понравилась и я знаю, что такое качественные, интересные и крутые игры с одиночным сюжетом, ведь я переиграл во множество одиночных сюжетных игр.

The menu is a headache and is overly complex. Unnecessary amount of nudity and sex scenes. Combat music is awesome, free roam music will put you to sleep or give you a headache, depends. Little motivation to free roam due to the clunky controls. Fast travel is a pain in the ass. On to the good. Massive amount of things to do. In fact you will never run out of things to do. The story is interesting. Gerald is a charming main protagonist. Characters and voice acting is great overall. Interesting monsters and witcher contracts. Side missions aren’t bad. Overall this game was a chore for me to play and wouldn’t recommend unless your a fan of the previous games/books or enjoy medieval stories and lore.",7,2020-07-25,PLAYSTATION 4,user

XD_Grimlock,"Yes this is years late. Yes I’m also not going to go into much detail because everyone that loves the game already has expressed what I feel. Let me say this. I’ve owned the Witcher 3 four times now. 3 times on PS4 with it being twice on base and once on the pro, and the final time being on my pc. I have yet to finish the 4th time but I have never owned a game this many times or have completed it this many times. The game is a masterpiece and is personally my all time favorite game I have had the pleasure of playing. No it’s not for everyone and I will not sit here and bash someone for it. However, the fact I can still list every main characters name like yen & geralt, ciri, triss, dandelion, etc. and then people to explain who they are as characters and the emotions they feel, no other game has had this kind of lasting impact on me.

It's a game that lasts long and never gets boring. There are great games around, but I dont think I'll ever find one this good. The only ""flaw"" I can find is loading time can be long.

DurinsBeard,A much belated review but necessary nonetheless. Most engaging and well developed story in a video game I have ever seen with the best array of characters and interactions/relationships. I have replayed this game at least a dozen times by now on both ps4 and pc. The blood and wine and hearts of stone DLCs are more in depth and better crafted than some stand alone games these days. I make sure to play this game at least once a year if not more. Story - 10/10 Characters - 10/10 Game play and combat - 9.5/10 Graphics - 9/10 Triss - 10/10 I would give 10/10 but in all fairness there is no game which is perfect.

LazyNinjaUK,"The Witcher 3 is one of the few games to me that nails everything it sets out to do. As Geralt of Rivia you exist in a world that fears and despises you, as a monster slayer you are feared by non-humans. As a mutated human with super-human powers, you are hated by normal folk. Seeing the world and engaging in the story through Geralt’s reserved eyes is what makes him such an engaging protagonist. The characters and locations of The Witcher 3 are so enjoyable to explore and interact with, its easier to get lost and lose time. Though the combat feels like its showing its age, there is still plenty of depth and satisfaction to be had wielding two swords along with your arsenal of spells, potions, bombs and depths of knowledge. Once you understand that this isn’t a game you can just wade into a fight and expect to win, you’ll realise there is far more depth to be had. Tracking a monster, learning its weaknesses and preparing for a fight really make you feel like a Witcher. If you are in any way a fan of RPGs and riveting stories, there are few games to date that surpass the quality, immersion and beauty of The Witcher 3.",10,2020-07-19,PLAYSTATION 4,user

With all most half the budget and half the team of Rockstar it shows the amount of work that went into this game. The world is huge and beautiful. They made every single corner of this game feel special and unique from the other. The world should be a landmark for all video game open worlds. The dialogue in this game is amazing especially with the options of dialogue we have in this game. That wouldn't have come if it weren't for the amazing cast of characters in this game. The cast did a fantastic job and deserve every bit of respect for that. The gameplay felt a bit clunky at first but as the game goes on that feeling fades away with the exception of the world and characters. The story too feels very bland on paper but they made it so that it was unique, mysterious and a fantastic 10/10 story.

I enjoy having a challenge in a video game so I liked going for quests that where made for a later point in the game. I am also glad that the developers didn't buy into the demands of crazy SJW's when making this game that want diversity at any cost. The Witcher is based on polish mythology written by a polish guy that comes from Poland a country that has a demographic of 98,5% white people. 8/10 because I could not play chess and the combat could be just spamming from time to time.",8,2020-07-11,PLAYSTATION 4,user

It has a fantastic story, beautiful graphics, beautiful characters, excellent gameplay, great side quests, and great voice acting. It's so good that I've spent almost 300 hours playing this game, finishing it a total of 3 times. I played the day one edition of the PS4, and then the GOTY edition including all expansions and DLCs on the PS4, and then again on the Switch. The story isn't complex but it doesn't have to be to be engaging. It's well executed and had me hooked from start to finish. I also loved the soundtrack; some of the music was so haunting it gave me chills (in a good way). I would describe it as an open world, action RPG game set in the third person. The setting is medieval times where they have swords and and magic instead of guns and technology. The world building is amazing, not to mention the sheer size of it. If it wasn't for fast travel (travelling quickly from point to point), I would've taken much longer to complete this game. One thing this game excels at that sets is apart from other games is its side-quests are meaningful and don't feel like a chore to complete (I'm looking at you Final Fantasy VII Remake). The two DLCs Blood and Wine and Heart of Stone are both amazing and Blood and Wine is huge for a DLC as it introduces a whole new region. The mini card game called Gwent is absolutely amazing. I was so addicted the first time I played it and couldn't believe a mini-game could be so good. I've probably spent more time playing Gwent than some fully fledged games. If you're a fan of medieval settings and swords and magic and action rpgs, then I highly recommend you play this game. You definitely won't regret it.",10,2020-07-02,PLAYSTATION 4,user

UnnamedUser,"This Game would be perfect if it wasn't for the gameplay. The story keeps you interested at all times and the world is filled with interesting characters and incredible side-missions. Not to mention the beautiful graphics and a perfect voice acting. This is one of the few open-world ganes that doesn't seem hollow and that doesn't make you think that it's there just to follow a trend. So with all of these it is honestly frustating how simple and repetitive the Gameplay can be, the way that Geralt moves is so weird and feels slippery, if that makes sense and the combat is just okay, sure you have the signs but they don't truly provide that much to the experience. That said I wouldn't recommend this game if you care more about gameplay than a good story or good RPG mechanics. But if you're hoping for an unforgettable RPG with one of the best stories that gaming can offer, play It, you won't be disappointed.",8,2020-07-01,PLAYSTATION 4,user

MarinoMele,"9.3/10 - excellent. Who thought that the new Final Fantasy game I was expecting wouldn't be developed by SE? Joke aside The Witcher 3 is one of the greatest RPGs, and games, of all time. It's biggest strength has to be the world-building. The secondary quests are so well crafted and well-thought that every game that came after felt immediately, outdated in this regard. It's simply incredible how the NPCs of each village help to make this world more real and believable - to the point where the secondary quests are actually more enjoyable than the main story. The graphics are great for that period, to think that an open-world-game could be this beautifully detailed and rich, and the music is maybe even better. I really enjoyed the soundtracks. But.. this is no perfect game. It has its flaws: - The main plot is almost nonexistent until the late hours of the game, overshadowed by such great sidequests... it needed a bit more memorable moments throughout it's telling; - The combat, being this an action RPG, feels limited on the strategy side since there's nothing better than a good old sword. The alchemy and preparations before battle should have been more useful in order to be just more than a gimmick. This is why TW3 isn't perfect, but this game's greatness is undeniable.",9,2020-06-30,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Benchi,The Witcher 3 is by far the best game ever made. To this day there has been no game to come close to the Witcher 3 story telling. The side quest are better and more detailed then most other games main story missions. The game characters are iconic and so well written. Cd projekt red is setting the new industry standard that’s hard to live up too even when you look at dlc it is done so well the blood and wine dlc has more and better content then most triple A games. This is without doubt a must play and I truly can’t take anyone gaming opinions seriously if they haven’t played this game.,10,2020-06-30,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Some which severely effected gameplay (no sound for whole swathes of quests etc) which should really have been patched long before I got round to playing it several years after release. I would have been furious if I had paid a lot for the game on pre-order rather than picking it up second hand to play during lockdown. Despite those points it was still enjoyable to play through, some very likable characters, fun puzzles and some moments where I was laughing out loud.

Сеттинг не смогли реализовать так,как бы этого хотелось.Мир пустой,хотя есть и прям красивые интересные места. Боевка наверное сильнее всего отвращает от игры,2 удара-сильный и мощный. Есть еще заклинания,но они почти никак не добавляют интерес к игре. Вся игра это скучное скитание по миру и убийство мобов(некоторые боссы выполнены хорошо) на пути к следующий катсцене. В игре выполнен хорошо только сюжет,но сам игровой процесс настолько нудный что меня максимум хватило примерно на 11 часов(начинал играть примерно раз 9). Техническое состояние игры для 2015 года я бы сказал постыдное. Диалоги не в катсценах это 3 кадра: сам геральт,твой собеседник и общий план лиц этих двух героев. Если не играл в хорошие игры подобного плана-как ознакомление с жанром отлично пойдет.

honestreviews99,"Along with the original Mass Effect trilogy, Oblivion, and KOTOR, this is my favorite game of all time. There are so many things I could praise, but I will highlight several that come to mind: - Side quests don't feel boring or repetitive and are often more developed and interesting than some main quests - The open world element is great; it doesn't get old exploring around and feel like the worlds are re-using the same features and elements. It is truly fun to just explore with Roach and see what you'll find - The voice-acting of Geralt and many other characters is top notch. - Your actions and decisions do actually have an impact on the game - there are quite a number of different endings you can get depending on your actions throughout. Not to mention that other characters and plots are affected depending on what you choose - The gameplay, while improvements could be made to horse movement and handling as well as some improvement to swordplay, overall, it was very enjoyable and the fighting mechanics definitely felt the best of the 3 games in the series. - I couldn't wait to get home from work to get back on this game and play some more. I had way too many nights where I stayed up much too late playing this game. Overall, one of the best RPGs out there and definitely worth a play.

Ed95PkFr,"Easily one of the greatest games of the last decade, if not all time. A near masterpiece which facilitates any type of player that's hoping to invest a *ton* of hours into a phenomenal story which takes you on a beautiful journey and really tugs at your heart strings. CDPR have done Andrzej Sapkowski's (Creator of Witcher series) work complete justice. The sheer detail present in the world's diverse landscape, complexity of characters and nuanced decision-making with *significant* consequences are all cutting edge progressions in gaming. After what CDPR has brought to the table, I think people will no longer accept lazy writing and meaningless black and white role-playing from developers, which is a win for everyone. You don't have to have played 1 and 2 or read the novels to enjoy this game as I know many who played it this way and loved it. The game delivers easy access to lore and backstory into the earlier games and Sapkowski's universe throughout. That said, the novels (which all take place right before the first Witcher game) are amazing in their own right and I would recommend playing Witcher 1 and certainly Witcher 2 (also brilliant), just for the maximum experience. Furthermore, if you are the type of gamer who complains that the Last of Us is 'too much like a movie', then you might not enjoy this game, as it is very story driven. 100% completion of this game probably requires 150 hours gameplay and 50 hours of cinematic cut scenes and dialogue, give or take. Anyway, to rate w3 pros and cons: Main Story: 10/10 - Everything has already been said praising this aspect of the game. Draws more familiarity and lore from the novels than 1 and 2. All in all, brilliant writing, Characters: 10/10 - Introduces notable characters from the novels, many completely new and some brilliant reappearances from the 2 earlier instalments. Nearly all major characters have dynamic personalities and will become very memorable, even long after you finish the game. Combat: 8/10 - Better than your average hack n slash button mashing, especially on the harder difficulties which I recommend playing on. Can get repetitive after a while though. Graphics: 10/10 Side Quests: 10/10 Exploration: 9/10 Player choice: 10/10 Dialogue/voice acting: 10/10 Soundtrack: 10/10 Crafting/Alchemy: 9/10 As for the cons: -There is a few minor bugs and glitches that pop up through the game which can be irritating -The hundreds of supply caches in Skellige is rather lazy imo, reminds me of ubisoft -Looting system is rather hit and miss. Lots of diverse and useful items for crafting and alchemy but the level scaling means rare weapons/armour you find are often below your level and therefore pointless. Generally speaking, the negative things i discovered were really minor and hardly detracted anything from the overall magnificence of the game. In reality, I would give this game a 9.5, but I would say it's closer to a 10 than a 9. Now, I await Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine.",10,2020-06-10,PLAYSTATION 4,user

ERRORCODE-20,The Witcher 3 is a great game but I feel its greatness is overstated a bit. Yes it has some of the best quest writing in any game that has ever existed but it's combat is far too clunky and the game is way too glitchy to really be the greatest game ever like many people would have you believe. Because of the slow movement that geralt is forced into when he engages in combat it makes positioning Geralt to feel clunky and over rely on dodging and quen to get out of harms way. If the game wanted to look realistic it could've still had Geralt in his stance but allow some freedom of movement anyway. This would make positioning more important like in games like Bloodborne for example. This game also has very little depth. Yes you have tons of bombs and oils that help in defeating monsters but Geralt never gets any new moves throughout the entire game. At least none that really change your playstyle in a meaningful way. Every weapon in the game has the same move set even if the weapon is completely different like a hatchet. it gets stale after awhile. Nevertheless the quest writing is superb and this game has a lot of great characters and world-building. So that alone is worth the price.,8,2020-06-06,PLAYSTATION 4,user

paulocidro,"The witcher 3 é um dos maiores, se não o melhor jogo da história. O começo do jogo é bem devagar, mas depois de mais ou menos 1 hora, 2 horas de jogo voce já se sente totalmente inserido naquela história. O jogo é envolvente,voce se importa com os personagens principais e até mesmo com os secundários. As missões são extremamente profundas, até mesmo as secundárias. As secundárias são tão incríveis que dá vontade só de ficar fazendo as missões secundárias e upando de level antes de ir fazer uma missão principal. Simplismente incrível. The witcher 3 is one of the biggest, if not the best game in history. The beginning of the game is very slow, but after about 1 hour, 2 hours of game you feel totally inserted in that story. The game is engaging, you care about the main characters and even the secondary ones. The missions are extremely deep, even the secondary ones.

MissDove,"This is an exceptionally huge game. Near complete lore. Long main story. Expansive map. Countless items for crafting etc. Loads of side quests. But the positive aspects of this game pretty much end here. Every other aspect has either at best being implemented much better in some game, or at worst being almost broken. Generally, the world feels too compressed, not just content-wise but also aesthetically, in a sense that the rations feel somewhat wrong (trees and houses only being slightly taller than the main character, for example). I also failed to see why the graphics got so much praised, as the reminded mostly of graphics of consoles of previous generations. Gameplay feels clunky and sloppy lacking fluidity. Meelee combat is limited to a couple of moves with lengthy animations. Spells are inconvenient to cast since it is needed to access a menu mid-combat to change the single active spell available. Menu navigation also feels too primitive and simplistic and ends up being annoying especially if taken into account the vast number of options in a single menu. The main plot is basically ""find this person, to help you find this person, to help you find this person, to help you find this person, to help you find your daughter"". Details of the story are not as bad as it sounds but the way it is delivered is anything but immersive. Characters are variable but some of them not deep enough, and could use a bit better voice acting. What really makes this game not fun to play though is its lack of polish and the too important bug that make The Witcher 3 feel more like an awesome alpha version of the game, or a descent beta version of the game. The auto generated path to objective will often be wrong. While riding the worse, it possible for the horse to stop moving instantly because it encountered a non-existent obstacle. Horse also auto steers when on roads which make it extremely annoying as it conflicts with the commands given by the player. By the far the worst thing I encountered is that some sound tracks will be missing during the majority of the game. This usually are combat or spellcasting sound effects, or worse plot important sound effects during a cutscene. Around 1/3 of game voice tracks of the character were completely absent which forced me follow dialogue solely through subtitles. In short, this is a huge game with huge potential, though execution was extremely poor. I would have preferred if this game was half the size but so big issues which are so evident even after a few hours of gameplay were resolved.",2,2020-05-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Professorfett,"The Wild Hunt story is finishing off the trilogy of the Witcher series in a very interesting way. Unlike most third entries you are not required to have had played the first two to understand what is going on. Much like in the books containing Geralt; this game is a continuation and a self contained story all in one. So for those of you that missed The Witcher 1, and 2 fear not this game will be just as enjoyable. The story is about Geralt (who is a monster hunter) tracking down his surrogate daughter Ciri to save her from The Wild Hunt. That is the base premise believe me there is so much that I won't mention to keep those who haven't gotten it to have a fresh untainted experience. This game actually made me not only care about the characters but feel an array of emotions. I felt anger with the antagonist, laughter, bloodlust, and hell I even got teary eyed in a couple of scenes. This game has such great writing and storytelling. The game has multiple ending based off decisions you make throughout the game. My friend and I were playing the game to see who'd finish first and we'd discuss what'd happen in our stories. He had killed people I didn't, and I had done certain missions complete opposite than what he had done. This is grade A storytelling and it makes me wish that most third entries in games could have this kind of finish. The game is the best looking game out on the new generation of consoles. This world looks alive and feels alive. It will actually change over time due to the choices you make. The game is a work of art come to life. For those of you that have some blood lust; The Witcher 3 has you covered. Chopping off heads, and cleaving bodies in two has never been a beautiful as it is now. The game sound is fantastic. The game is all fully voice acted with each actor sounding like a professional. While Geralt character has a monotone (his character isn't supposed to have emotions) the voice actor still some how manages to convey emotions, and tones while still keeping this gravelly monotone voice. The gameplay is what I've been looking for in a fantasy game. When you are fighting with a sword it seems very realistic. While you the player may be jamming on the square button, Geralt is doing the art of water dancing. He is doing these low cuts, high cuts spin moves, it is truly something just to watch him fight. On normal the game is the exact amount of challenge I love in games. It keeps you on your toes, while not being stupid hard. The fact not every enemy can be beaten by your sword alone. Each enemy has a certain weakness to blade oils, magic signs or perhaps just a good ole fashion bombs. In doing that the game never feels repetitive in the slightest. The game has a open world like Skyrim, but with it constantly changing and new mission that are all unique in every way you will have over 100 hours of top notch gameplay here. Overall the game is perfect. I really have no issues with this game at all. It would melt away hours for me and when I wasn't playing it I would think about the game. CD Projekt Red is my favorite developer for creating such an experience with this series. If you were on the fence about this game I urge you to find any way to play it; whether it be beg borrow or steal just get your hands on this. I give this a 5/5. I'm a bit sad I now must move on from this game. I of course leave with a question. What are your favorite games of all time?",10,2020-04-21,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The developer should be ashamed. 2 - (VERY BAD) These games are so bad they're insulting. 3 - (BAD) Just bad. Game suffers from a wealth of problems in all areas, very few redeeming qualities. 4 - (MEDIOCRE) A game that has its fair share of serious problems with a few glimmers of quality sprinkled throughout. More than anything it's forgettable. 5 - (OKAY) For every positive this game has there is just as many negatives. You may be able to find enjoyment in these games however you will likely be met with equal amounts frustration and disappointment. 6 - (GOOD) There is a decent amount of fun to be had in these games albeit with a few noticeable drawbacks. Worth checking out at some point especially if on sale. 7 - (GREAT) A game that has some flaws but all in all is a great game worth every penny of its purchase price. 8 - (AMAZING) Game of the year contender only allowing for some minor flaws. 9 - (SUPERB) One of if not the best game released that year, truly special. 10 - (NEAR PERFECT) One of the best games ever made.",9,2020-04-20,PLAYSTATION 4,user

kotulp,"!!This Review is in Slovak Language!! Dlho som váhal či si to kúpiť alebo nie. A nakoniec som sa rozhodol že to predsa len skúsim a neľutujem. Witcher 3 je podľa mňa najlepšia RPG hra. Prepracovaný herný svet a príbeh, proste kvalitná hra. Toto čo dokázal CDPR sa dlho nikomu a žiadnej hernej spoločnosti nepodarí prekonať ešte veľmi dlho. A dokonca si trúfnem povedať že prekonať to môže jedine CDPR s nejakým ďalším titulom. Questy ktoré sa tu nachádzajú sú také originálne že to ani nieje možné.Ľutujem len to že som to nekúpil skôr. Klady + Príbeh + Postavy + Postavy ako telo(Yennefer/Triss...) + Humor + Open world + Detaily + Optimalizácia + + + + + + + + Zápory A aby sme len nechválili... - Klepna(kôň) občas zaklepne o nejakú prekážku - Combat na koni nieje zrovna to pravé orechové - občas sa stane že za Vaším oknom znova vykukne slnko - možno prídete o pár priateľov lebo proste hráte Witchera - možno prídete o pár členov rodiny počas hrania - možno zmeškáte narodenie svojho dieťaťa, jeho narodeniny, jeho maturitu... - možno Vám pretečie celý život medzi klávesnicou... - A ak ste si mysleli že nejaká hra je vaša obľúbená Witcher Vás vyvedie z omylu.

Cuiru,"FRESH and STREAMLINED. The game doesn't bog you down in all the pomp of other hardcore RPGs like Elder Scrolls, nor is it a one note feature like FF15 (the combat), nor is it just about the concept (Horizon, Tomb Raider, Assassin's Creed It puts you into Geralt's shoes fast and wants you to fulfill all the vicarious desires that player deserves from a premium priced title. Even the pieces of paper you pick up often slots right into your Beastiary. A perfect example of how gameplay and story inform each other. The sidequests are just as rich if not better than the main story, and you will never hate yourself for staying up another 15 mins to open that door and find that a ****** has ****** the people within. I never felt the need to reach for a guide as they made sure I wouldn't have to and I still am content knowing that I got the most out of the game. And the extra stuff in between? Pure gravy.

Patrick73,"The Witcher 3 è l'apice della storia videoludica. Al netto di un gameplay non al massimo a causa di animazioni un po' troppo legnose e ripetitive, anche se risulta essere comunque molto divertente e vario, la trama, l'ambientazione, le musiche, i ****, la quest principale e tutte quelle secondarie, i due dlc e la vera e propria trama risultano essere INARRIVABILI per chiunque al mondo. Su The Witcher si potrebbero spendere fiumi di parole ma l'unica verità è che questo titolo va semplicemente giocato, e ognuno singolarmente deve arrivare alle proprie personali conclusioni. Voglio chiudere questa recensione sottolineando come The Witcher 3 sia anche un adattamento fantastico dei libri, in quanto capace di inventare una storia nuova nel pieno rispetto dell'autore originario.

Gotrek74,"Even 5 years after it's launch, The Witcher 3 stands high alongside other RPG's. The graphics give a great atmosphere to the world as do the characters via the voice acting and writing. Missions have quality too even if they do have the usual fetch/carry/kill/defend objective. They are given choices which never seem to be black or white in morality but shades of grey leaning to good or bad instead. There doesn't seem to be a right or wrong and even when it does seem that way, it rarely works out as you envision in the end. Combat is not unique but can be as simplistic as you like with just swords and dodging like a dog in a bath or complex with oils to assist your damage, potions to buff you or debuff enemies and spells to complement your meleé abilities. If you want to do and see everything you are looking at 100+ hours in the base game alone.

In the case of The Witcher 3 the story is phenomenal: characters are incredibly constructed and the fact that I didn't play the other titles didn't bother me at all. I got so into the story and got attached to the characters that I felt emptiness when I saw the credits roll. The open world is beautiful and very detailed, even secondary missions and quests aren't repetitive and have a story line of their own. Graphics are stunning and fights are epic.

luc1996,"The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt may very well be one of the greatest games of this console generation, and possibly of all time. The vast scale of the Witcher 3 is what, ultimately, makes this game what it is. You have the ability to explore 3 large areas (including Toussant) and several smaller areas, each with its' own distinct culture. Whenever you walk into a village, more often than not you can make decisions that will shape how people respond to you there and in the general area. Wherever you go in the witcher 3, you can count on one thing. It's gonna be pretty. NPC's are very well voice-acted and Geralt's voice actor did a great job portraying him. If you're looking for a game that you can quickly beat, this isn't it. I started playing the Witcher 3 in March of 2019, and only just now finished it in Feb. of 2020. This game had me from start to finish. Even the side-quests had me on the edge of my seat. The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt is wild indeed.

Fodwazle,"Now this review could very well change and only for the better as I have not played the full game yet but so I'm a little bit disappointed by this game. I see games in a different way to most. A lot of people see story in graphics in games as important, sometimes more important than anything else. I'm not like that at all. I see graphics and story as secondary features something that's nice to have in a game but absolutely not necessary. In terms of the gameplay the crafting system seems to be very promising if not a bit overwhelming. The combat is alright but doesn't seem to be great at rewarding skillful plays with parties and whatnot, it's mainly just using signs and then mashing x. The graphics and story are amazing but as I said I don't find that quite as important. The music is also good. In terms of enemies there's a massive variation, obviously, and each feels unique, although some attacks aren't telegraphed too too well. I have 2 gripes with the camera:1 the lock on mechanic in this game is the worst of any game I have ever played. I'm not exaggerating at all it is **** I could do a better job than them and I'm one person as a low level programmer but I genuinely could. 2 the camera seems to love geralt back. It gets a bit irritating that geralt takes up half the screen, especially when the FOV of this game is so small. The camera does go back for combat but I wish we had either a wider FOV or the camera was just pulled back a bit. It makes the character feel clunky. The side quests are well done but another issue I have is the white dotted line that leads you everywhere. I won't cover it but game makers toolkit has a great video on why minimaps ****. In conclusion this feels like a massive game that has potential but I think a few things were dropped for other things that in my opinion are of less importance. But as I said I haven't gotten too far in the game so my review may change",7,2020-02-08,PLAYSTATION 4,user

DanneSmith,"10/10? A masterpiece? Best game ever? Who's everyone rating this game like it's a masterpiece? To me it's mediocre. It has its peaks. Sometimes it's enjoyable. But as others have said it has too many poor design choices to be good or above that. There's nothing special here. Story is just cliché medieval fantasy with boring conversations adding nothing to the main plot. Combat is mostly unbalanced. Enemies are either too easy or suicide level challenging. It's painfully obvious how the developers made soldiers almost impossible to kill to force people into fighting monsters, so reviews wouldn't say ""It's like Assassin's Creed."" Mission payouts are close to 0. What you're gonna do with 50 Coins? Might as well loot everything and sell that for better profit. Perhaps you earn more later. I might figure that out some day. There's alot potential here. The design of the world is impressively detailed (especially rural locations), but that's pretty much the only impressive aspect. Back to my question. Who's everyone rating this game like it's a masterpiece? I know who. It's kids who aren't old enough to know the true masterpieces of gaming, and those who love it just because of the genre of setting and/or gameplay. To me it's nowhere close masterpieces such as BO3. I mean... masterpieces such as MGS3.",4,2020-01-26,PLAYSTATION 4,user
kaancag,"This review is done in 2020, after 3 replays over 4 years. Witcher 3 still stands out in narrative, storyline, atmosphere. The game is immense with low repetition compared to other open world games. Gameplay becomes outdated each year however playing on Death March difficulty gives a great satisfaction. Imagine spending 30 minutes on a contract, preparing the correct potions, bombs, decotations and oils, the proceeding with the kill. Feels like becoming a witcher for real!",10,2020-01-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user

It really combines Skyrim, GTA 5 and Dragon Age taking best from them. this is 10/10 for all parts of the game. The soundtrack is just amazing (i've even bought it separately), Gwent takes over, travelling and discovering is endless and very exciting, side quests as interesting as the main and sometimes are even connected and affect the main story, animations are brilliant as the main story is.

Gamer1465,"It was either this or Bloodborne for my favorite game of 2015 and this one edges out it for one reason. The phenomenal DLC (I love the Old hunters though as well). The main story is perfect trying to find Ciri is the perfect way to close out Geralt's story, sure it doesn't continue the promise from the Witcher 2's ending but it still is one of the greatest games of the generation. The new characters are perfection, even returning characters and finally the game debut of Yennefer and Ciri, what isn't there to love. The choices are hard as well, who should I romance? should I be a father figure? all these lead to different endings which there are many of. Sure the villains of the game, the Wild Hunt aren't the greatest but they still a serviceable to the story and add an extra layer to Geralt and Ciri's story. The greatest thing about this game is that you don't have to play the first two or read the books to understand what is going on, but I recommend it because then you will know who some of the characters are. By the end you will feel satisfied no matter what ending of the three you get. Hearts of Stone DLC was a great start to the first of two paid DLC released in the Witcher 3s cycle. The new characters like Olgierd are complicated and interesting and old characters like Shani make a return to give a satisfying end to her story. But when talking about Hearts of Stone the first thing that comes to my mind is the amazing villain Master Mirror AKA. Gaunter O'Dimm, he is so mysterious but yet convincing it makes you hate but love how evil he is. Once again CD Projekt Red know how to give a satisfying ending.... perfection. Blood and Wine can be disputed as one of the greatest DLC's ever created and why I gave the upper hand to this rather than Bloodborne. A whole new location in Toussaint and this is one beautiful location, I just sit in awe everytime I reach it. The new characters as well are great and so is the complicated villains Detlaff and Sylvia, but also who doesn't love fighting vampires, so cool. But this is the best ending I have seen maybe ever (even in films), I have never wanted more but also didn't want anything because of how satisfying it is. They even released free DLCs, like free costumes for Yennefer, Ciri and Triss and even more. Every gamer should experience this game at least once, you will not regret it.",10,2019-11-11,PLAYSTATION 4,user

superpyro296,"The witcher 3, compared to other RPG's, is in another category or level. Here, you have an open-world game that is filled with interesting and varied side quests. The main story is engaging and we have a good plot with interesting twists. The graphics are top notch also. So, that's why I find it fair to give a 10/10 to this game. I just completed the main story today (completed most of the side quests and contracts but left a lot of ? marks on the map unexplored). It took me around 96-100 hours. I really liked how each main area in this game had his unique charm (Velen, Novigrad and Skellige). In general, the game has a nice soundtrack too. However, even though I give a 10, this game is not perfect. There are a few minor glitches in the animations, contracts to kill monsters can get repetitive, the leveling system can be a bit odd and the fact that the game has different endings (which can be seen as an advantage) had some flaws here (won't put details here as I don't want to spoil anything). I rate this game as a 2015 game, so this is clearly a 10. In 2019, I can understand that the standards would be a little bit higher.

robomartion,"Dull story, borderline amateurish writing and voice acting, this is quite clearly a game made by Eastern Europeans and not in a good way. The Witcher 3 is lowbrow and unrefined like a blunt instrument made by someone who believes they know what they are doing but in reality is far from qualified. If it weren't enough that the games writing and characters are out of some odd fan fiction, the dialogue moves slowly and lacks choice, character control is oddly primitive, combat like an arcadey, spammy hack and slash, the skill system bloated and unnecessary and the environments are boring and samey, not invoking the slightest bit of curiosity or wonder and the much touted feature - the graphics - are technically strong, testament to the quality of the asset libraries they are from, but somehow hard to look at, suffering from poor, or perhaps no creative direction. I could perhaps forgive the game for some of these problems if had at least one redeeming quality but there are none.. even the menus are an unwieldy mess. It is a travesty and telling of the gaming community as a whole that games like the Witcher 3 receive unhindered praise with its glaring and fundamental problems unnoticed. Perhaps it has honest intetions, and I'm sure it does, but someone needs to step in and say this is note the genre defining game it is touted to be.

LoFi,"I played through all of The Witcher 3, from base game to DLC. The story was engaging enough to keep me going that far, but that was it. The character writing and story was great, but actually playing through the game was torturous. * The movement controls are bad. Geralt can not turn for anything. Neither can Roach for that matter. This has created a number of scenarios when I just die, because not only is turning a huge pain, but so is fall damage. How does fall damage work? You either die, have one hit of health left, or no damage. I have fallen from a cliff mouth and died while running from enemies. * The glitches. The glitches take the cake for what make this a disastrous playing experience. We have basic bugs, like flocks of birds flying away in a big cluster ball, or NPCs Ubisofting through the floor, ot even the game screaming at me in bright colors. Those are okay. Those are fine. We also have the glitches that make you reload or hop a cliff to undo. A good example is one of the locked buildings in Skellige: I came across it while exploring and fell through the wall and into tje building, and since I wasn't to the quest it was involved in, I couldn't get out. I have also fallen into knee-high puddles with no way to get out. * The combat is boring. The Witcher 3 is a hack-and-slash RPG. You have three attack skills: Sword, crossbow, Igni sign. It gets pretty easy unless you crank the difficulty, amd even then it's a game of rolling until you win. Overall, this game was not worth the amount of time I put into it, and I feel it was a major step down from The Witcher 2.",4,2019-10-05,PLAYSTATION 4,user

ShiSharkU,"When people say this is the best game ever made, they're not lying. It truly is! The game doesn't have a scripted story, it's based on your choices but no matter which path you take it feels emotional and engaging. The game makes you feel so many different emotions ranging from happiness, curiosity to fear and sadness and many more. It's open world is one of the largest and the most beautiful but it never feels empty, the soundtrack is the best I've ever heard in a video game. The combat is fun, even though the enemies should have had more varied move sets and it lacks the hardcore challenge even at the highest difficulty. This is the only thing they could have done better. The game is worth a buy in 2019 and it will be for many years.",10,2019-09-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user

BarbedWhyre,"Let me start by saying I understand why everyone enjoys this game so much, to where it got a ""#4 Best PS4 Game of 2015"". As someone who didn't play it in 2015, and played it for the first time in 2019, this review is through my eyes. The story starts with a slow build and overstimulating tutorial which starts the trail on rocky footing. I learned most of my basics while in the middle of a forest between side-quests, which may be the best part of the game. The characters are well designed and the world is well planned, it's just a shame the same isn't said for the basic mechanics of the game. The controls and character movement feels loose, travel and interaction with the world is unpolished at best, and combat is nearly a nightmare. Perhaps i'm better off with 2015 goggles without current greats like ""Spiderman"" and ""God of War"" to compare it to, but maybe it's time for a sequel and tighten up the loose bolts on this nearly immersive game.",7,2019-09-15,PLAYSTATION 4,user

So many people act like this game is so great and think they are different for thinking it's a masterpiece, when in fact they all are parroting the same thing about a game that isn't that great at all. First off, this game isn't very good at, you know, being a game. The combat is abysmal, their pitiful attempt at adding any modicum of depth was adding oils to the blade that are useful in certain scenarios to make it appear as if you aren't playing a game who's combat is half a step away from being as shallow as something like Kingdom Hearts. Who cares if the world is expansive or the story is fine if the game play itself is abysmal; it's like having an oven that doesn't heat anything up. Next time someone says something to the effect of, ""I'm not a normal gamer that likes Call of Duty or FIFA, I like real games like The Witcher"", remember the teenage girl scenario mentioned in the first sentence, and just have a chuckle.",0,2019-09-05,PLAYSTATION 4,user

MurphyBrandon,"The Witcher 3 is an enjoyable game, but it definitely has a few issues. The game world starts out alive and vibrant with clever storytelling, a memorable cast, scenic views, and music suited for an epic adventure. Before you reach the middle of the game, the player can start to notice recurring flaws that never seem to go away. Simply finding an item in the inventory can be frustrating because the menu responds slow and there is so much clutter in your bag space. Moving around in the game world can be clunky, as well. Geralt often gets stuck in awkward spots or doesn't do what you want him to do. Falling a meager 10 feet results in annoyingly weak death. In my playthrough, I completely stopped using the crossbow and bombs because the aiming was incredibly stiff. Now I must say that the boss fights were fun and satisfying, but most fights in the game can be won with brute force. I appreciated the diversity among enemy types and some were particularly interesting to read about. However, those harpies and sirens flew above me for minutes instead of decisively attacking, which was a waste of time and ruined the pace of the action. At the very end, I felt that the conclusion to this series was solid. 8/10.",8,2019-08-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Berik,"If you really love a franchise and treat it with respect, you get a game like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. The game is based on the work of Andrzej Sapkowski, and is the third entry in The Witcher video game series. Story: Very Impressive and interesting, characters are well defined and tied to the plot. The stakes are high, and the world deals with multiple subjects like war, political instability, racism and fanatics. The world: Very beautiful, very atmospheric with fitting music and it is huge. Maybe even too huge. Enemies: The game offers many monsters to slay, each unique with weaknesses and strenghts. Learning about each individual monster during Witcher Contracts builds suspense, and gets you on the edge of your seat as you search for clues. As you do this, Geralt talks about the deadly features of your target, and plays on your imagination as to what the monster will do and look like. Controls and fighting: User friendly, but tough to get into. In the beginning you'll get punished for mashing the attack buttons, but once you learn to be patient, dodge and attack at the right time, you'll be able to fight like an one man army. When it comes to moving around outside of combat, there are some strange design choices. The default movement speed is jogging, and Geralt makes some ridiculous rolls when he walks down stairs or jumps off low ledges. Technical aspect: The game scores a negative point in this category. In many instances while playing The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, game breaking bugs appear. For example, during the mission with the Whispering Hillock, the sound of the game completely fades and won't return unless you restart the application. This breaks the immersion a lot as the dialogue is gone. Later on, skins on monsters cropped up on the head, which made the model invisible. This did not stop the monster from clawing the **** out of me with no option to fight back. Again, this breaks the immersion. Things like this happen a lot throughout the game. But what is worst, is that these bugs have been present in the game since 2015. Considering i'm writing this review in 2019, it is unacceptable that the game still has game breaking bugs 4 years after release. Shame on you CD Projekt RED. In summary, this game is excellent, with many impressive elements in it. However, if it hadn't broken my immersion so many times (especially considering it was my second playthrough) it could have been a mind-blowing game. It earns a 9/10 from me.",9,2019-08-01,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Empyrea,"I've just beaten this game so here goes my impressions: everything is great, graphics are stunning, just like in RDR 2 and this game is from 2015! Soundtrack and voices are also excellent, and the plot is good (although too slow). You can choose the dialogues like in Mass Effect or you can go straight to the main dialogues if you want. Sometimes you feel like a detective, like in L.A. Noire. The first thing I did was to low the joysticks sensitivity from 1 to 0'8. My complaints are: the tiny letters (lucky me I've a huge tv and I don't have much problem), another thing is that when you jump or fall from not so high places you lose health, the last thing to mention would be that sometimes you feel that the story advance too slow. If you like rpgs you're gonna love it. If you like games with only action and more action maybe this is not you're kind of game. To sum up, I think this game has taken all the good things from other games and have made it a must have. Advices: stick to the main missions unless you want to raise your level or you feel to do this or that sidequest. The only sidequests that I'd recommend you to do would be the ones related with main characters. About magic, I normally used the Quen sign, but you can use whatever you want. I'd recommend to improve the Axia sign if you want to save some money, and do horse races to improve your horse and have more room for your things. It probalby took me 60 hours or so. About sidequets, there are some of them that will be cancel at some point if you don't complete them and you only go for the main missions, still, you don't know which ones are so, I wouldn't worry too much. Now that I've finished this game I'll probably do a couple of high level sidequests or hunts and that's all.",9,2019-07-08,PLAYSTATION 4,user

DULAccd,"A fantastic game, one of the best RPG-s ever. The gameplay is disputed, many gamers saying that the controls and combat aren't so good, with an ok leveling system which will show you a little bit of the game's quests, but, at least to me, the bread and butter of this game is the story. The game makes you really feel like a witcher, with well detailed quests, activities and random events. The map is large, with plenty of things to do, but, to be honest, it is a little buggy, mostly in the underwater shipwrecks. There is a variety of weapons and armor to collect and trade with the merchants in the game, which are well realised and plentyfull around the map. A variety of enemies also exists, making the game less repetitive than other RPG-s,avoiding reskining the enemies. A grand minus of the game is the underwater combat, which could have been much better,I would tell you more about it, but I will let you experience it yourself. Overall, you will enjoy the game, if you let its problems aside and focus on the overall experience.

Kokosnuss,"Mit dem dritten Teil haben sich die Entwickler selbst übertroffen und ich meine damit ausdrücklich nicht die überambitionierte technische Seite des Abenteuers. Die Welt des Hexers ist neben Himmelsrand einer der schönsten Abenteuerspielplätze überhaupt. Allerdings solltet ihr euch von Augenfreude und Naturromantik nicht täuschen lassen: Land und Leute sind von den Narben eines endlosen Krieges gezeichnet. Rassenhass, Verbrechen und Selbstsucht sind an der Tagesordnung, was der Welt eine Art grimmige Glaubwürdigkeit verleiht. Überall wird gelitten, geflucht, gekotzt und gestorben. Dementsprechend kümmert sich Geralt auch häufig um die Belange des kleinen Mannes, anstatt von Fanfaren begleitet hohlen Bombast vom Himmel regnen zu lassen. Dass man dabei von den Geschichten zum Teil wirklich berührt wird, spricht für die Entwickler. Kritik gibt es von mir für das Kampfsystem, das meiner Meinung nach ein wenig direkter sein könnte und für die langen Ladezeiten.

Tellus12,"Possibly the best game i've ever played under almost 30 years of gaming. I don't usually go for games this big, but it's immersive world, countless creative storylines, adaptable combat system and range of charaters dragged me in. As a fan of Witcher II I played this hoping for something better, and I got it. Despite Witcher II's excellent setup and result, this sequel betters it in pretty much every way. The open world style creates a sense of freedom where you can find hidden away traders or random scenarios where someone needs help, it also creates tat chance where you could run into a creature that you have no chance of defeating and are foced to flee from. I hope they don't bodge the tv series of this franchise as it would not do justice for these games as they are top of the line entertainment. The DLC I have also smashed the granny out of and both are well worth the time introducing new, and sometimes terrifying, characters with intricate plotlines that compliment the world around Geralt of Rivia and his medieval posse. Just play it because words alone do not do this game justice.",10,2019-05-31,PLAYSTATION 4,user

H310,The combat system is boring. You won't be able to read subtitles and others texts on screen. The PS4 version is just a bad port from PC. Framerate is unstable and the camera and the player's movements are laggy and awkward. Button assignments are appaling and there's no way to change them (only through the system).

jgmj921,"Witcher 3 is the greatest game ever made. The 2-3 weeks journey I had playing as Geralt of Rivia will be one of the most unforgettable experience in my 20s. Its uniqueness lies in so many aspects, the immersive open world setting in a mid century background, the depth of the story and carefully drafted lines by every character however trivial, are simply incredible. Unlike most other games with fancy graphics but mostly only touches the surface of the storyline as well as each character's inner world, Witcher 3 spared no efforts in building the most realistic characters possible, and really spent time in each story or tasks. Each second I spent in the game was vivid, as if I was there talking, exploring, fighting or flirting with real persons. Each characters are lovable - they love fiercely, fight honorably, stick to their code of living or cling to their troubled past. They can be charismatic, humorous, artistic, or dangerous. And all of them are put into this epic, incredible world. I am forever grateful to spend 2-3 weeks of my holidays on Witcher 3 and its the 2 dlcs. Thank you CD Projekt Red.",10,2019-05-13,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Sky123,"The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt is a majestically magnificent master piece, it is my 580th game that i Tried / Finished but it ended up in one of my top 3. The game is colossal & amazingly excellent in every perspective. World Design : Game world is colossal & gorgeous, excellently designed with exclusive & extensive details such as fallen trees are regrown just like in real life, burned or cut down portions of forests, Dead whale on a shore & various type of fish under water are just very few such examples. It is a Living breathing world monsters will also attack other animals, wolves will hunt rabbits & dears. During cloudy weather you will be able to see clouds moving in the sky & shooting stars at night. Game have excellently implemented dynamic weather cycle, day and night cycle as you will see a dramatic difference between day and night life. Visuals : Graphically game is stunning and even more gorgeous after the latest patch. Animations are top class and facial animations are impressive. Narrative : Story is impressive and easy to understand, no matter how many or all the side quests you play; you still wont get lost. Game offers the opportunity to enjoy company of beautiful characters & decent humor. Choosing dialogues is one of the best part of the game & Dialogue options are one of the best with various types of choices with provides an enjoyable experience. Unique Features : Witcher 3 have some unique features that you wont find any where else such as Geralt beard physics. Other examples are :- On Skellige : Gedyneith (Name Of Place) there is A House Under A tree when you visit that place for the 1st time you will see a dude plowing in soil but when you go there later you will see plants. You will see many changes in dandelions inn & main hall in Kaer Trolde castle throughout the game. Combat : Combat is enjoyable, addictive, tactical and superb both ways offensive & defensive. AI is intelligent & will use various defensive measures. Despite high level enemies you still can defeat them with tactics & patience. Other than basic close combat and ranged weapon, there are bombs & sign abilities (Basically Magic). You can use your ability points on skills but will choose wisely b/z you cant acquire them all as it is an RPG With choices & consequences, But you can reset them with potion. Other activities : Beside side quests there are witcher contracts and treasure hunting, you can also participate in horse racing, boxing & playing cards. The card game is also very fun & extremely addictive. Replayability : I doubt that some one will play this game once as of the colossal dialogue choices. The game felt vastly different while selecting different dialogues through second game play. I finished it twice and i am gone buy Complete addition & play it all over again.",10,2019-05-09,PLAYSTATION 4,user

RickyCombat,"I know this is the unpopular opinion, but I didn't enjoy this game. It's definitely not one of those games you would necessarily enjoy just because you like Skyrim or something. The character movement is pretty janky, and a lot of the story feels like a never ending domino effect of fetch quests. You need to find something out, it brings you to a guy, he asks you to do a fetch quest, which brings you to another guy, who won't give you the item until you do a fetch quest for him, which brings you to another guy, etc etc, Rinse and repeat. I give it the 6/10 because I can appreciate how dense it is with lore and background. It's pretty cool that you could read some lore in one of the novels, and then find something about it in the games. There's a lot to chew on, and if your a fan of the books you'd probably love the opportunity to play as Geralt. I can appreciate that, but it just didn't justify the hype for me.",6,2019-04-29,PLAYSTATION 4,user

tomvs123,"Western RPGs haven't changed much over the past 20 years. Every 5 years or so, I'd play one and find out that besides graphics, it's essentially the same or worse than Baldur's gate. But The Witcher 3 at least takes a noticeable step forward, with small improvements all around. Western RPGs (WRPGs) normally have a very basic and short main plot, with the majority of the game comprised of unrelated subplots, side quests, and exploration. The Witcher 3 isn't different here, but improves on most of this when compared to past WRPGs. But it's far from perfect and likely won't change the minds of people who aren't fans of the genre. The side activities take up the vast majority of the game. This is definitely a game for people who want to roam about in an open world, exploring and doing random tasks for its population. As someone who doesn't like these sort of activities, I actually had a great time during the first 10 hours of doing this. Saving villages, finding hidden treasure, and hunting down monsters while going place to place in my quest to get information on my daughter (the main quest) was great. But there's only so many different side activities, and they're eventually repeated, several times. What immersed me during those first hours is that the world is more real than most WRPGs I've played. The NPCs, while not very talkative, did a good job convincing me that they lived in the world. Quest givers would interrupt me and give me convincing reasons why I should help them. And all of this was taking place while I was on the main quest to obtain information, so all side activities felt like they were potentially useful for that purpose. This is opposed to other WRPGs were you have an urgent main quest, but it's somehow put on hold whenever you feel like doing side quests. The other WRPG I played most recently is Dragon Age Inquisition. To compare the two: The side content in The Witcher 3 is much more interesting, but just about anything is more interesting than Dragon Age Inquisition's boring and inconsequential fetch quests. The world is simply more believable and feels less like developers randomly made up things or plopped down monsters on an evenly-spaced grid. The protagonist is much more believable since he's a set character and not a blank-slate made up by the player. As I became bored of the side content, I focused more on the main plot: finding your daughter, and the things that come afterwards. It's mostly believable, but it's an average drama at best. At least it doesn't immediately thrust us into a ""save the world from the bad guy with stupid motivations"" plot. This is better than most video game stories, but isn't up to par with the best that video games have to offer. You might be disappointed if you're looking for a story with deeper meaning or something comparable to the best fiction that humanity has to offer. All characters are fully voice acted. Unfortunately, all of the voice actors aren't equally good, so if you're one of the few who can point out bad voice actors, you'll find a few here. It's also a bit jarring when most characters use a British accent, but some large roles are played by people with cartoon-quality American accents. Combat is fully action-based and isn't amazing. It's serviceable, but clunky. I never felt like I had accurate control of my character, and primarily resorted to spamming the same attack with an occasional spell. And that's really all you need to complete the game on the normal difficulty level. The in-game menus are slow, swimming is horribly clunky, and horse riding is about as good as the combat. The game doesn't feel very polished and it can really hurt the immersion for some. And then there's the bugs. This is the buggiest PS4 game I've experienced. Clipping models during cut scenes, invisible swords/gloves, dialogue overlapping, monster corpses with required quest items on them disappearing, getting stuck, full game crashes, and load of other issues that really hurt immersion for me. Well, at least the automatic 10-minute autosave comes in handy, so I never lost much progress. And one last thing that really bugged me: The mini map. The game's navigation and quests depend on it. You're rarely told where a monster is or your next quest objective is. NPCs seem to know that you have a magical map that tells you exactly where everything is, complete with a dotted line that shows you the quickest path to take. It wouldn't be so bad if I could ignore it, but it's simply not possible. You receive so little information from NPCs that you'll never find out where to go unless you follow the mini map. Just count this as another thing that takes away from the game's immersion. So, this is likely an amazing game for WRPG fans, or for those who easily become addicted to side content in open worlds. But for me, I found it to be a slightly above average experience.",6,2019-04-08,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Simple actions like riding or mounting the horse can be very frustrating. - Very easy (I played in 'Blood and Broken Bones' difficulty, Please play on 'Death March' difficulty if you want to enjoy the combat). - The combat system is ok, but the enemies set of movements and AI is poor. - The story is quite poor till the last 5/6 hours of the game.

Zeratex,"Easily one of the best game of all time. The gameplay in Witcher 3 is full of strategy and variety from builds to fight approach, the mechanics, and the amount of stuff you can do, variety in monsters and utility you do and take, exploring and different maps which offer different lore and different environment, interesting crafting, great lore/explanation behind everything in the game (unlike other games they dont just throw **** at your face they actually invest in making it logical and well supported by the lore). The Story is one of the best in gaming history. Side quests have meaning and care behind them (not all but even the small ones and contracts are far from being bad) Characters are unique and offer great development with distinct personalities. Choices actually matter and have consequences on the game. Witcher has good animation and graphics, great art design, great music and voice acting, fun and strategical combat, a lot of gameplay options and innovations to the RPG gameplay (set a new standard) it has a good plot (pacing, content, folklore, choices, content, engaging premise, good ending) with very few issues it has also the best cast in a game imo (great diversity of characters, amazing personalities, good development, good backstory on a lot of them, they have their presence, the DLC villain is one of the best villains of all time in gaming he is not one-dimensional, you feel the characters you feel they are alive & are part of the story and part of your journey example is Regis, it also has some nice catharsis for the main character Geralt) The game also offers high replay value due to different builds and choices. The Combat is better than most other RPG games, it is not the best combat ever sure but its still good for an RPG story driven game. You can dodge 2 ways roll and sidestep, you can use different strategies like bombs, oils and crossbows you can unlock new moves, you have signs and upgrades for them and each enemy has some different moves for an rpg this is enough. There is a lack of choice of weapons sure, but unfortunately that is because Geralt is a swordsman and the game should adapt (or adopt?) its source accurately.

skthegreat,"This is my game of the generation. Simply put, it is the best experience a video game can offer. It's been three years since it came out, so I'm sure you've heard all the praises of its story and characters. So let me talk about some of the criticism the game has received. If it's not your type of game, I can understand that. The reviews of 6s and 7s I truly understand. I strongly disagree with them, but I can understand if someone just didn't connect with the RPG mechanics. But, and this is a huge but, all the criticisms I've read for The Witcher 3 are overplayed. Seeing people rate the game a 3/10 over its combat is a disgrace. I never found the combat to be lacking in any way. Yes, it's based on timing. What else would it be based on? That's not a rhetorical question, I'm trying to think **** where physical attacks weren't based in part on your timing. More importantly, combat being based solely on timing is a blatant lie. You MUST use your Witcher abilities (the signs) to overpower enemies, both humans and monsters. Carefully dodging and dancing behind a shield-bearer to strike him doesn't seem to be a thing of timing, does it? Playing the game on a higher difficulty (highly recommended) makes you use the full Witcher arsenal of potions and blade oils. It makes for a very interesting, intricate combat experience. In fact, a criticism I surprisingly couldn't find anyone talking about is the disparity of stats in loot. It feels weird to me, to complete a maze set by a dead mage, and receiving a sword (Having Geralt name the sword about his adventure is a very nice touch), or having a master craftsmen gift me a special sword, and then later on, finding a sword with much higher attack power in the hands of some random henchmen you kill. This is a nitpick, but still something that bothered me. However, I'd be incredibly biased to give this game anything less than a 10 over a nitpick. So many great things about this game like the story, dialogue, sense of adventure, the most amazing unique quests, and even the smaller things like the addictive music and the card game: Gwent. If you're still stumbling around Metacritic looking at reviews, trying to decide if you want to get this game, then let me be the first to tell you: This game is a must-play. No matter the platform you play on, it is one of the best, if not the best, experiences I've had playing video games, and I've been playing games for over 15 years.

LZephaniah,"This is a great game. The depth and variety in the world and all the many side quests is extraordinary. It deserves the reputation it has. BUT... it's not 10/10. This is a flawed game. Obviously all games have flaws, but to my mind if you barely notice the flaws first time (because you're immersed, engaged or having too much fun) then such flaws are negligible; sadly that isn't true of The Witcher. Some of the flaws are minor but frequent. Glitches are common. The inventory system is terrible. The UI for many game mechanics is counter-intuitive and never explained in-game. The combat is detailed but not that satisfying (for a game about being a master swordsman/fighter there really isn't enough impact to the combat). The biggest flaw here, however, is that this game really needs an editor. I love how much content there is, but often it feels padded. A lot of missions involve a cut scene, walking 50m, another cut scene, another brief bit of walking... There are times where it is effective and immersive to make the player do everything (like early on when preparing to meet [an important figure]), but often this stuttering approach to storytelling happens even at dramatic moments of the plot and it kills the pacing. (It doesn't help that cut scenes are often exposition heavy and delivered at length between 2 characters with a couple of fixed camera angles.) Side quests based around a single gag or interesting idea may turn out to take far longer than is interesting due to additional fetch quests, tracking missions and some generic fights. It all just needed a ruthless editor to keep pacing alive and side quests free from bloat. Compounding this editing problem is a subtle failing of game design: most games give thought to play sessions but the disrupted pacing means the end of a plot section can always be anywhere from 2 minutes to an hour away with no way to tell. And good open world games attempt to signal to the player whether a side quest is a brief diversion or a whole extra chapter. The Witcher doesn't: there's no way to tell from the beginning whether a side quest will be a 5 minute diversion or a 2 hour sequence of events. As I say: I love the amount of content and the variety on offer. But a bit of editing and game design could've stopped that content from becoming a deluge of tasks I've missed, forgotten about or am now overlevelled for. TL:DR great game, worth playing, pacing and game design problems slightly spoil the greatness of the open world and storytelling.",9,2018-12-04,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Coolaps8,"I played this game 2 years after it came out and I had no expectations going in since I didn't see any of the trailers, I never (and still haven't) played the old games and after watching gameplay of it I really wasn't sure about if it was for me. I was blown away by how everything comes together. Gameplay The gameplay is similar to most RPGs in terms of quests, loot and dialogue. The main difference is in combat at the 'Witcher Sense' mechanic. Tons of people had a lot of complaints about the combat system. I personally love it and it's a very refreshing combat system since I haven't played a game with a similar system. It strikes that perfect balance of complexity and simplicity. It takes a beginner to learn but a skilled player to master. Your 'Witcher Sense' adds a whole new layer to missions with it providing clues and a general sense of any nearby enemies. I don't know if they were in previous games but needless to say I'm a big fan of the system. Story/Missions The story is very well executed even though I feel it drags it out a bit too long (especially tracking down Ciri). The game took me around 40 hours to finish, this is with a healthy balance of doing story/side missions and getting collectables. The game really shines with it's characters with Geralt. Yeniffer and Ciri being the best. The relationship you build between these characters aren't ones you'll be forgetting anytime soon. The relationship between Geralt and Yeniffer is one of the best romances in games with Geralt and Triss not treading far behind. There are dozens of endings and I got the best one. This evokes a lot of replay value, this adds more bang for your buck with the content being well over 100 hours in length. Presentation The game looks damn beautiful, the 'Blood and Wine' expansion especially showcases this. Whilst there were downgrades from the gameplay shown at E3 you won't mind at all whilst playing since what is there is still gorgeous to feast your eyes upon. Technical Issues Whilst there was nothing game-breaking the issues I encountered were significant FPS drops in major areas like cities, villages and big battles. The game crashed for me three times during my two playthroughs, two of these took place in cities and the other occurred during a loading screen. Conclusion This game is damn near perfect and will be played and praised for generations to come. If CD Projekt Red can deliver this same quality in their upcoming title 'Cyberpunk 2077' we are in for something special. This game is definitely worth the retail price just off the main story alone, the rest is just gravy. It's for this reason that I'm giving this game a 9/10.",9,2018-12-04,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The only thing you should be aware is that initial 10-20 hours may feel a little bit awkward and overwhelming as the game offers tons of elements and functionality.

LaSh4wn328,"I have some criticisms to make about this hugely overhyped game: - The combat is shallow, awkward, and static. By the time you've beaten the prologue mission in White Orchard you've seen all there is to see. No new combos, no new weapons, and very limited enemy behavior variety. Almost all fights can be won easily by just spamming fast attck and dodge. The spells, bombs, and crossbow are all worthless except for rare specific situations. - The graphics are bland. Sure you get the occasional pretty sunset through the trees but that's as good as it gets. There's also pop-in, clipping, re-used assets, uncanny valley doll people (LMAO at the ""sex scenes"") and muddy textures. It honestly looked like a PS3 game most of the time. Plus there's not much variety, just medieval forest, medieval village, medieval town. - The story is crippled by the presence of dozens and dozens of characters who are treated as important, but who (as a new player) I don't know and couldn't care less about. All it takes is Geralt saying ""Hey, it's my old friend Blorbo!"" and the game thinks this guy is now my friend too. The absolute worst was when I had to spend like 15 hours trying to rescue ""Dandelion"" without ever having even seen the jerk. Here's a clue to the developers: if you need an in-game glossary to remember who the hell is who, you need to trim the cast way way down. - More broadly, the plot is an awkward mish-mash of medieval private eye noir and epic fantasy. Geralt must urgently save his adopted daughter from evil warping Skeleton Knights, but he also has weeks of spare time to unite a drunk with his estranged wife and spring his buddy from Church Jail. The Wild Hunt are the most cardboard, cliched villains I've ever seen in a widely praised game, and are honestly barely in the game until quite late (tbh the Crones are far better villains, though the end of their arc is unsatisfying). Geralt himself is pretty shallow, just a gruff-talking tough guy who everyone claims is a cynical antihero yet he always somehow does the right thing and helps the little guy. - It crashed a bunch of times. It is by far the buggiest AAA title I've ever played. - It has the MGS4 problem where it often felt like in an hour of play, I spent 35 minutes watching cutscenes (including choosing dialogue prompts like a choose-your-own-adventure novel). This was frequently very boring. People claim ""your decisions have consequences"" but this isn't really true, it usually comes down to which of 2 NPC's winds up dying at the end of a sidequest, but I didn't care about either one anyway and the rewards I get are equivalent. In any case if I wanted a novel I'd read a novel, I want fun gameplay and character growth. - The looting/crafting/gear was just awful. Most of the alchemy stuff isn't worth bothering with, and once you can craft Witcher sets they render the rest of the crafting redundant (I had a million crafting diagrams I never even looked at, they just clogged up the crafting menu). In the early game my best weapons were ones I randomly found on dead guards, and every ""important"" heirloom weapon I was given by the plot (Iris, Aerondight, etc) was crappy and useless. Repairing was also a huge pain as I had to return to town after every couple missions, which meant loooong sloooowwww loading screens. - Lastly, there is nothing fresh or creative here. 3rd person open world games are a dime a dozen, and this one doesn't even have stealth or parkour. There was not a single thing that makes this game stand out in my memory as a unique experience, aside from the unusually tangled and flabby storyline.",2,2018-11-12,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Lately I ended up giving up all of my hopes on the gaming industry, knowing that the focus would be put in battle royale games and pay to win/loot boxes models. CD Project RED absolutely restored all my hopes. A stunning, masterfully crafted and player-centered game. A MUST PLAY.

Breathtaking soundtrack, amazing landscapes, astonishing attention to details (Geralt's beard will grow spontaneously during the game) and a wonderful story. Secondary quests that are as deep and long as a mainstream game's main quests and DLCs that are absolutely worth buying.

TeaDrinker,"This is by far my favorite game of all time. From the gameplay, to the story, to the music, the visuals, everything is damn near perfect. Up until this point, I had never played a video game that I though about constantly. At school, I would look up the maps for all the grandmaster armour, at dinner, I would contemplate what swords I should use, it was an obsession. i changed my entire sleep schedule just to get more game time. After more than 100 hours in a month, I was still dumbfounded by all of the grandiose set pieces and swelling music. Story: Absolutely phenomenal. I cannot imagine how another game could ever surpass the story telling in this game, as the player's choices have a legitimate impact on what happens, and each and every conclusion to your decisions is satisfying. The side quests in this game were nearly better than the main quest, as they were legitimately interesting and involved. This is the Witcher's crowning achievement and sets it apart from other games. Gameplay: Great. The swordplay and use of runes was exciting and fun up until the last drop of blood. Though repetitive at times, the speed and elegance of Geralt's movement is enthralling and makes the combat worth it. As a result, Gerald can be a but of a spaz when walking around, as he is incredibly fast, but that's really only a minor issue. Audio and visuals: Awe inspiring. Though the visuals are incredible, and hold up to 2018 standards, the music is even better. The sound designers perfected how the world should sound, and it does a massive part in immersing the player in the game. Conclusion: The world is huge and full of life, and is an absolute joy to explore. If have ever played, or want to play video games, this is an absolute must play. A game like this comes along once in a generation, and is in my opinion, the best game in the last 10 years, and will probably be the best for at least the next 5 years.

GuapoGrande,"Serviceable but honestly pretty disappointing considering all the hype. Mostly it is a generic 3rd person open world game (a market that is massively over-saturated these days) in a Skyrim-style dark fantasy world that is most notable for the sheer never-ending volume of sidequests. The story is fairly poor. Geralt is a Mary Sue fanfiction character: he is a fearless world-famous badass, all women want him, even his enemies respect him, and he is always ready with a snappy comeback. He never suffers any serious defeats or reverses, and never even seems to worry this is even possible. He is amusing at first but quickly becomes dull. The villains are one-dimensional and bland (and mostly absent from the story, to be honest), and the main plot arc never feels even slightly urgent, so feel free to spend weeks doing odd jobs and hitman contracts for smelly villagers. Most of the main plot is ""find this missing person, now find that missing person, now help this guy find his missing people so he gives you clues to find the other missing person"" and on and on. A whole epic fantasy world gripped in the middle of war and intrigue, and you spend most of your time lackadaisically searching for Geralt's sassy daughter. There are also way too many characters, most with minimal effort put into their development yet the game expects us to care about them. It's miles away from games like The Last Of Us or Uncharted 4 which are tightly plotted around just a handful of fleshed-out characters. Meanwhile the combat is so-so. Pretty clunky, to be honest. Just use fast attack, sidestep, parry, and shield spell, and you can win almost any fight in the game pretty easily. The upgrade system is uninspiring, with most benefits just coming from increasing stats and with minimal variety added to gameplay over time. The crafting and looting systems are gruesomely awkward and tedious, I mostly stopped bothering trying to loot anything about 12 hours in because the camera is so awkward and it slows the game to a crawl. At first I tried crafting a ton of different potions, oils, etc, then finally realized all you ever need is the health potion and the damage up potion (oils and bombs are totally worthless), and things went a lot quicker after that. There is way, way too much content here. The side missions and contracts become tedious and repetitive before the game is halfway done, and a lot of them are obvious filler (admittedly a few feel substantial and well thought out). Using detective vision to follow bright red footprints is kind of neat the first couple times, but deadly boring by the 20th time even though there are dozens more times to go. It would honestly be a much better game if it were shortened 50%. It's also buggy. I'm playing it over a year after release with all patches installed, but it has crashed and frozen multiple times and pretty frequently I encounter weird broken animations, clipping, teleporting NPC's, non-functioning controls, and other issues that have no business being in a final release game. I appreciate the ambition of what the developers went for but that's no excuse for sloppy product.",3,2018-10-29,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The beautiful graphics do little to compensate a clunky and at times tedious movement system, an overall boring main story line and a wonky combat system. I found the beauty of this game to lie, most of the time, in its great side quests rather than the main story. Some amazing characters populate this game’s world, and some side missions will highlight amazing storyline that unfortunately, seem to end all too quickly due to their nature of being just side quests. Like many other overrated titles to come out in recent memory (like The last of us and Horizon Zero Dawn) I found myself disappointed with The Witcher 3 all throughout its uninteresting story.

mikeg218,"Great gameplay, giant maps, lots of different **** to do, hours of gameplay - but at the cost of your sanity. Apart from the inevitable glitching the f out - as with most games this size - the story-lines are annoyingly long and leave you no freedom to leave or load a previous save. There are a lot of points in which if you proceed, you will probably fail a secondary quest you have yet to complete. You'll be pressing the skip button for upwards of 5 minutes just to get through the excruciatingly long dialogue just so you can load back to a previous save point and complete the quests you missed. Then you have to sit through the tedious story line that plays between loads and when you switch to different maps in the game - probably in place because the load times take ****. Then there are times where you can't follow a quest line how you would prefer because the game makes it impossible to finish a story with a character once youve gone too far. Essentially, it forces you to take your sweet time going through the story lines in the game or else risk failing quests, which to my mind is incredibly frustrating. Overall, great game, but holy hell it is a very frustrating game. You need the patience of a saint in order to fully enjoy playing the game. Overall, yes the game is",4,2018-10-20,PLAYSTATION 4,user
psylife,"The combat has weight and managing the stamina adds a welcome tactical layer to the experience ; that said the game knows only to challenge you by spawning a stupid amount of enemies. Button mashing is often necessary and interior combat is as bad as it gets, which is a situation the game puts you in often. The magic signs have their importance but you will be spending most of your time recharging your shield which essentially confines your magic abilities to boosting your armor. The perks, abilities, and weapon upgrades are mechanically useful yet they fail to excite beyond their functionality. Dialogue wise, the genealogy of answers is quite shallow and deprived of branching - Suffice to experience Deus ex: Human revolution's dialogue system to understand what I mean by that. There is no ""Game"" to be found in the dialogue mechanics. The characters are inanimate dolls and the choices on offer are nothing more than a bunch of glorified playback buttons. Exploration wise, I think the game does a descent job in terms of environmental story telling, but nothing that is worth the praises beyond the best the competition has to offer. Shenmue 2 does much more in my opinion and the game came out nearly 20 years ago. The investigative phases are a real joke too, where you are mindlessly following red marks - yet another example of shallow, unaccomplished mechanic. The pacing is a real problem too ; During the first half of the game (10hrs), the story literally stalls. The game becomes more engaging once you reach the second half, but it feels too little too late. The characters are likable and by the end of the game I did feel some attachment towards some of them. The difficulty is also an issue, where the beginning happens to be much harder than the end; I beat the final bosses on my first attempts while being vastly under-leveled. The visuals are fairly bland retrospectively ; For instance, I find the sunsets particularly vulgar and over-saturated . The towns also, lack authenticity in their structure and layout, and that is particularly jarring if you compare it to the original Assassin's creed's urban layout, which feel substantially more authentic and researched. To conclude, I'd say that the disproportionate success and admiration this game has generated, comes from the fascination that the average nerd historically hold toward medieval sword and shields ; It's the ""game of thrones"" generation that has brought Wild hunt to the pinnacle. Wild hunt is not a bad game, it's just so far from being this timeless masterpiece.",5,2018-10-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user

I had tried Skyrim but found myself not enjoying it sadly. However Witcher 3 is immensely fun to play and beautiful to immerse yourself in. The enemies are diverse and many. Your knowledge about the beast can be learned by reading or fighting against them. The sidequests are not a chore to do and do not feel like the usually ""fetch and deliver"" quest you get n RPG. Here you get a story with each quest and a small quest can even at times escalate into an even bigger story. One of the best Fantasy RPG I've ever played.

The graphics are bad, buggy and even cutscenes are sometimes choppy. The menus are very badly design, they're slow and with too much areas to go to when you want to check something. The loot system is also bad: you loot the same boxes over and over again and no meaningful items are found. The map is bad and not connected. The scenery is great at first but it's always the same. And it lacks rewarding by exploration. The enemies are so clunky and bad designed as well, they don't feel very plausible. Even the magic is bad: the symbols are so similar with each other. They could at least make some different icons more related with the actual power. Sure it's better than a great number of games. But a 10? Not a chance.

I do understand it is not each and everyone's cup of tea since the game is bit lengthy but at the same time it does come up with the value for the time you invest. Ciri is another playable protagonist character here, who's skills are fun to explore. Undoubtedly the character development of Geralt is exceptionally good. Skill tree, combat systems and creation of useful stuffs such as various types of bombs along with equipments, makes the game complete. Also, the support by developer aka CD projekt was essential. ( Unlike **** ea ). Huge maps to explore and value added DLC does do justice to the game. My over all experience with the game is stunningly good. Worth calling it a masterpiece. Right from world design to combat systems, each and every elements were perfect at their place.

Ishmaul,"The Witcher 3 is a phenomenal final installment to trilogy that has continued to amaze since its inception. Not only does it take some aspects from well acclaimed games in multiple genres but it meshes them together beautifully. This games a blast to play whether its your first go round or multiple play through. Pros: The Characters brought to life in this game really make the game shine due to the different personalities and view points. The player begins to love or hate each one of them. Interactions with each whether friend or foe help the story flow and take shape depending on the choices you have made or could make. The story itself is a great aspect of any game but The Witcher 3 really makes it stand out. It is like taking part a novel itself; one you don't want to put down. The plot twists, side stories, and subtle clues are award winning. The Combat is in a league of its own, due to the player preference in leveling that can change the entire style of the protagonist's combat abilities. I tended to play as a buffer with potions and decoctions but have dabbled in signs or just running over enemies with beastly sword skills and improvements. This game is easier to learn, but difficult to master especially in the higher difficulties and learning about each enemy is almost as important is leveling up in itself. Gear/Leveling was done well in a way that helps slow the pace of the game and helps players have a drive to do everything on the rather large maps with all those joyous little icons you want to grey out. Not to mention some of the Witcher sets are badass to look at. Finally, the size of the game isn't something to be upset about considering all the DLC with new quests areas and characters included and the replay ability is astonishing since the choices you make in the first and second game can change this game ever so slightly. Not to mention the choices in the game can be felt in the later areas and chapters with the final overview at the end. The game is a must buy for any avid gamer or RPG lover, the only downside is that this is possibly the final installment but one can dream for a Witcher 4. Buy this or rent it either way carve your way through monsters and humans alike to see how you survive The Wild Hunt",10,2018-07-08,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Da3_who_knows,"As a person who read all the books and knows a lot about the witcher games I can say that this game is 100% the best in the series and 100% the best game in 2015. Gameplay, characters, music, mini games, setting... everything is perfect. There are not enough words in English language to describe this game. It is only because of this game that I read all the books about Gerald of Rivia, so I can understand every single conversation within the game, all the inside jokes, know more about characters. I was obsessed with this game for more than 6 months. It was a wonderful gaming experience and I was enjoying every second of it. However, there is one thing that have to be mentioned to people who will actually read it (I doubt anyone ever will though). GWENT. I played every single gwent game possible and I was crying when I heard CPR will make an actual gwent game. So yeah if you gonna play this game say goodbye to your life.

macca0507,"An absolute beast ****. One that I have gone back to after completing the main story- not for 100% completion purposes- just because I wanted to. Addictive, personable, engaging, funny and battle hardened. A better game for the PS4 I have not come across. The only negatives are a slightly (only very slightly) disjointed inventory system in which you may have to jump screens to check what you have vs what you need (for crafting, selling etc) and load times when you die are a pain (i'd say about one and a half to two mins). I never give games a perfect score of 10 as there is always some sort of flaw that prevents me from doing so but even the above mentioned 'flaws' aren't enough to drop this below a perfect score. Anyone that thinks God of War is an all time classic should really see what an absolute classic is. Witcher 3 is it.",10,2018-06-27,PLAYSTATION 4,user
64bitJesus,"Few games can provide artful, emotionally charged story along with super immersive game play. Few masterpieces, namely; Skyrim, Metal Gear Solid 5, Fallout 3 and Nintendo's Legend of Zelda series have accomplished this. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is among these masterpieces and is one of the best games I have ever played. I could write pages about what I like and I love, so I will try to note some small criticisms. Fall damage is unrealistic and annoying (save frequently before you try to scale a tall object), I got one corrupt save file that was easily remedied by a new save halfway through the same. Fast travel is nerfed from the previous Witcher game and requires you to visit sign posts ( forced/ encouraged exploration perhaps ?).

Anyway the overall package of this game is mind blowing. it is hard to describe. It is a game that brings other AAA games within its genre to shame. Not only because of ist content but also because of every way the developers are handling everything around the game.

morisblackheart,"I downloaded this game the day it came out. I was excited seeing all the trailers, the buildup, the screenshots and the massive hype. I was looking forward to a fantasy laden game with deep exploration, big monsters to hack and slash, beautiful and engrossing environments and strong characters. And what i got was a half baked, incomplete, raggedy mess! The only thing this game does well are the characters and character development. Everything else is sub par. The controls are horrid. Even after multiple updates fixing all sorts of bugs, CDPR are vehemently opposed to fix the clunky combat and control system. Controlling Geralt is like trying to control a lead balloon. In combat the camera never stays fixed so mobs just run past your HUD making you have to move your clunky camera to face them as they raggedly try to jump on you. Sword movements don't have any feedback - it feels the same when slicing thin air or slicing an enemy - the timing of Geralt is not consistent - a quick attack feels slower or faster at every input, not to mention there is also a very noticeable input lag, especially when trying to dodge and roll. The enemies movement is jagged and rough - so is Geralts. The concept of smooth combat is non-existent in this game. This not only applies to movement in combat but also exploration. It often takes multiple attempts for a input prompt to pop up while interacting with the world as your character is just a pixel of 2 off center. You have to press X multiple times in hope that you get the input as this is easier than trying to align Geralt properly. The menu is horrendous. It seems CDPR did not have a UX designer on their team during development. Equipment items and toggling through you menu items is tedious, clunky and slow. Its not intuitive at all - i mean how come there is no quick toggle between your inventory items and equipped items? You have to scroll using the d-pad though all your inventory items for the cursor to move right and land on your equipped items - and did i mention that even moving the cursor has a input lag - i constantly found myself hitting the d-pad multiple times for the cursor to move 1 slot. The world map is confusing and ragged - moving your marker from one place to another almost feels like scratching your nails on a chalkboard. It is so jittery and spotty. This is the map for god's sake - this is not in-game where you can expect frame rate drops in a game this vast, this is the god damn map screen. SMH Which brings me to the ""open world."" Its more like open areas than open world and you cannot traverse from one area to the next without using the fast travel mechanic. So how is this a true open world? Its a segmented open world - i.e the area you are in is open to exploration within its confines, but if you want to leave that area to another part of the world, you must fast travel, which turns the screen into a loading screen until it plops you into the new area of the game. Which also brings me to the sheer barren and lifelessness of the world you are in. Yes the open areas are vast but they are vast swaths of mostly wilderness foliage. The towns you come across are more or less all the same which gives you no incentive to actually want to go in a explore, unless its part of a quest. Natural exploration is limited in this game. If you wandered around aimlessly you will see the same thing everywhere - same structures, same enemies, same types of people, etc. Its not fun, unless you are on a specific mission or side quest. Now with that out of the way - this game has a few good things going for it. The main draw would be the characters and their story-lines. They are interesting, intriguing and compels you to want to know more, hence you finish that specific mission or quest to see it through to the end in order to find out the fate and outcome of the people involved. In some instances this aspect of game play can be quite deep and intricate. A lot of the characters are well acted and makes Geralt invest heavily in their missions - so you care about what happens to them and either want them dead or fight for their survival. This aspect alone made me want to continue playing just to see what happens to certain characters and unfold the story - which is a good one mind you. So i feel like this game is a great shame - a shame for what it could have been. It has a lot going for it but the execution is so poorly done its a chore to play. The sad thing is a lot of these aspects could have been easily fixed, i.e clunky movements, choppy menus etc by update patches but the developer i feel is too stubborn and is forcing us to play the game ""their way."" With all the updates this game has received in the last 3 years, the one that is most complained about - the clunky movement and jagged combat mechanics have never been addressed and we will never truly know why that is.",6,2018-05-28,PLAYSTATION 4,user
petermaffay,"Vorweg: Ich habe dieses Spiel um die 200 Stunden gespielt, alle DLCs und die Hauptstory im New Game+ ein zweites Mal erlebt. Gerade eben habe ich die letzte Erweiterung Blood and Wine beendet und sehe mich jetzt in der Lage ein Fazit über dieses Spiel zum Besten zu geben. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt ist eines, wenn nicht sogar DAS unglaublichste Spiel, das ich je gespielt habe. Der facettenreiche Charakter Geralt, welchen ich bereits aus den Büchern kannte und mich faszinierte, ist mir mit der Zeit immer mehr ans Herz gewachsen, sowie seine Freunde Rittersporn, Zoltan und Co., Liebschaften wie Yennefer und Triss (und viele mehr ;D) und zu guter letzt Ciri und seine Hexerkollegen. Auch wenn die Animationen der Gesichter in Sachen Komplexität nicht gerade überzeugen, bringen sie dennoch jede Emotion rüber und wirkten bei mir in jeder einzelnen der herrlichen Zwischen Sequenzen. Gerade das Finale des Hauptspiels ließ mich völlig Baff vor dem Bildschirm sitzen, den Tränen nahe. Ich möchte jetzt nicht auf alle Details eingehen, weshalb dieses Spiel eines der großartigsten Spielerlebnisse, das ich je hatte ist, sondern mich bedanken. Bedanken für jede einzelne Stunde die ich in dieser Welt verbringen durfte. Vielen Danke an CD Projekt RED, den meiner Meinung nach fairsten und fähigsten Entwicklern zur Zeit.

adrewtoremember,"An absolutely breathtaking game. Even for a game that is now 3 years old, it has some of, if not the best graphics on the system. The world is deep, well written, and chock full of lore and secrets. Combat punishes you for being unprepared, and is one of the more fun combat experiences in an open world RPG. You have signs (spells), two swords with separate uses, bombs, crossbows with interchangeable bolts, and varied armors to fit your playstyle. The Witcher 3 also has what I find to be one of the best open worlds in gaming. Environments range between putrid, corpse ridden battlefields, harsh snowcovered mountainous islands, and beautiful French inspired country sides. The quests directly effect the world, and can be seen by the presence or absence of characters in different locations. This game also has fantastic enemy variety, which I feel has been somewhat lacking in many RPG's and AAA releases as of late. TL;DR version, this is an absolute must play and has so much to offer.

Geralt, in particular, is one of gaming's greatest protagonists. - The level of presentation in terms of graphics, animations, interfaces, and all other visual elements are unprecedented in role-playing games. Bugs are often very minor. The attention to detail in this game is staggering. - A wide variety of gameplay opportunities that are all very detailed and varied. - Combat isn't anything revolutionary... but it works as it was intended to. That being said, the game controls very well. - Despite having never played the original 2 games, I never felt lost in the story or how the world works. - Respectable business model. The two expansions are just as, if not more detailed than the main game and are well-worth their price. There's no paywalls, season passes, or any other **** Cons - The game's portrayal of men versus women are skewed at times.

An experience system that only rewards repetitively questing and hunting monsters was a colossal waste of time. Along with a game company that gets angry when people ""play their game wrong"" seeing fit to change anything and everything a player finds that isn't hack and slash mechanics. Leveling up magic is this game does not ultimately help you. Any time a viable magic build has been found by players CD Projekt removes it nearly immediately stating that you need to be a warrior. Why is the combat system bad? Let's compare it to Dark Souls, Dark Souls is a game where you telegraph your moves and if you do the wrong move you are punished. In the Witcher 3 you also telegraph your moves, but your character at random changes targets, and flys around like a ballerina. The need for spinning attacks to be your ""fast attack"" is ridicules. This game focuses entirely on attempting to look appealing and not throws common sense and good game play out the window. The hit boxes feel miles long (for your character only) and while there is a dodge button it is completely useless because all enemies have a jump at you an attack move. Negating your entire dodge due to the extremely poor hit boxes. If you hit an enemy whilst they are in mid attack fear not they will still hit you, there is no such thing as knockback for enemies, that is only something the player character suffers from. If you do manage to down a few hundred monsters, don't not fret you will not level. You can grind monsters to your hearts content and your character will never improve as experience is largely only granted by quests. The unending struggle to overcome bad controls make this game nothing more than an irritation. The quest mechanic, the only thing in the game that seems to reward experience. The level recommendations on it are by no means accurate. A level 5 quest my decide it has level 12 monsters. Meaning if you attempt it at say level 6 you will be destroyed. The quests are always fetch this or go kill that. There is little diversity and leaves the game feeling like a second job. Personally, I would rather be earning money then grinding repetitively though a very unrewarding experience. A large problem with this game is effort to reward ratio is far of base. Nothing makes you feel like you have done a good job or achieved anything. Monster killing is pointless, but you'll talk to the right villager and instantly granted 400 experience, every level only takes 1000 experience to gain, so 400 experience is substantial. The questing experience isn't granted based on how difficult the quest is or how long it took to do, simply at random. If you are looking for a rewarding RPG in this sense, maybe try Horizon or any of the From Soft games (Dark Souls, Bloodbourne, Demon Souls).",0,2018-03-28,PLAYSTATION 4,user

jrdnnn,"I may be missing something here, but I have been totally unable to get behind this game, despite 20+ hours of trying. I'm wracking my brains to uncover why I cannot enjoy it, and it is difficult to put into words. The graphics (especially light effects and weather cycles) are really nice, and the Eastern Europe-inspired countryside is wonderfully realised. There is a nice atmosphere about the game and when you reach the second 'continent' it truly opens up. The dialogue choices are staggering and expansive for sure. The effort that has went into making this game is so evident throughout but unfortunately, for me, there are too many key flaws that mar the whole experience for me and have actually made me give up playing. The combat is awful, there are no two ways about it. Controls (both in and outside of battles...horse riding is a nightmare) are sluggish. Options for attacking are quick or hard strike, or dodge pretty much. 3 out of the 5 signs (spells) effectively do the same thing (stun the enemy). The camera and screen placement causes enemies to linger unseen ready to pounce on your preoccupied back. You can increase your damage output with potions and oils. And this is pretty much when the combat ends. The skills you can choose upon levelling up have little to no impact on the game, unlike similar lightly RPG titles like Fallout of Bioshock. The absence of true RPG elements here is probably what disappointed me most, yet the game feigns these properties often. Levelling up is almost entirely achieved via quest completion. The minimal amount of XP gained from killing enemies is baffling to me and one of the system's biggest flaws. And in the game's more difficult moments, there is no respite for trying to better yourself (like the Souls series or other traditional RPGs) - losing is often not your own fault but one of the many system flaws'. The story and characters are fine, but the endless fetch quest plot was already grating on me by the 20 hour mark. A single quest stretches on for hours with literally the same tasks repeatedly in succession. I failed tasks through absolutely no fault of my own (people dying in other locations). There is little motivation to complete anything, and when you do your rewards are meager. This all adds up to giving me little desire to progress in the game. This may be the game for many people out there (evidently), but I cannot play it any longer on account of the above issues. I recognise its merits as a well-presented, expansive and busy medieval world with loads to do and see. But being marketed as an action RPG, I expected these elements to be strongest when they are in fact the contrary. I can't get over the lack of depth in the game's battle and growth systems. I completely appreciate that the depth lies in the story/quest/dialogue-focused branching narrative, but this is not sufficient for a title in this genre. I'm maybe misinterpreting what the game's truly all about, but I thought this after the first few hours, after 10 hours, after 15 hours. It would be a waste of time continuing to play something that I don't enjoy, but this is not to say the game is rubbish. I just cannot see by its flaws giving their importance to me, and wish everyone playing it the best of experiences. The Witcher 3 is just not for me.",4,2018-03-08,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Kire_92,"This game had me hooked from the beginning to the end. The story was amazing, the characters were interesting, different and had great depth. The pacing of the game was good and the game opened up and became bigger and bigger the longer you played. The amount of content in this game is unbelievable. You get a lot of game time compared to the money you spend purchasing it. And there is a lot of different things to do in the game. The game had an amazing atmosphere, great graphics, unique quests and I loved the card game named Gwent! As an action RPG this game does almost everything right! But there are some minor flaws. The combat could be better. If I compare it to other RPG’s then this game does a great job. But compared to other actions games it’s a little bit lackluster. Tough I still enjoyed it and it was a massive improvement over the last two games. But it could have been a little bit better compared to how good the rest of the game was. Other than that I did not like the fact that every point of interest is marked on your map. It removes some of the explorations aspect of the game. And there are some other mechanics in the game that could have had a better polish. But those flaws are minor and I had an overall great time playing the game! This game is not only a good RPG… it’s an outstanding RPG!

34801,"Seid ihr noch da? Verdammt, ich habe mir einen Wolf geschrieben. Aber The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt hat mein Notizbuch genauso gesprengt wie meine Skepsis. CD Project RED gelingt der krönende Abschluss einer epischen Saga. Dieses Rollenspiel erreicht in offener Welt eine ungeheure atmosphärische Dichte, weil es nicht nur das Spektakuläre und Kämpferische inszeniert, sondern auch die leisen Töne trifft und das aufmerksame Erkunden belohnt. Es besticht durch enorm hohe Questqualität sowie erzählerische Klasse inklusive direkter sowie erst später wirksamer Konsequenzen, die einen immer wieder überraschen oder entsetzen. Ja, es gibt Kontrapunkte: Dass es auf Diebstahl in den Häusern der Leute keinerlei Reaktion gibt, ist für mich sogar noch ärgerlicher als die dämliche Statik menschlicher Feinde bei Beschuss. Das Menüdesign ist fade, die Schrift zu klein, die Dialoge nicht besonders verschachtelt, das Inventar schnell überfüllt und es gibt kleine technische Macken. Aber da ist die ausgezeichnete deutsche Sprachausgabe, das klasse Drehbuch, dem eben nicht wie in The Witcher 2 gegen Ende die Luft ausgeht. Es gelingt den Polen nicht nur sehr gut, eine mittelalterliche Fantasywelt zu zeigen, die von militärischen und sozialen Konflikten geprägt ist und voller moralischer Widersprüche steckt. Hinzu kommt diese fast schon verblüffende Hingabe in der Inszenierung dörflicher Milieus sowie der großen Stadt Novigrad. Es macht einfach Spaß, nur ganz langsam durch diese Welt zu spazieren. Wenn man davon genug hat, stürzt man sich in die nächste dramatische Quest, in der man über das Schicksal tragischer Gestalten entscheidet, oder man jagt in Traumkulisse mythische Ungetüme. Und das nicht über zehn, sondern hundert Stunden. Hut ab und Applaus!",9,2018-02-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user
jpacor,"Unpopular opinion, but I found The Witcher 3 to be incredibly average. Disclaimer: I tried playing Witcher 2 a few years back, but it was too difficult and complex for me. First off, Witcher 3 is much better and more accessible than 2, where the creation of potions, crafting, and use of traps is only required on higher difficulties. Now, the combat to me is still pretty boring: mostly hack n slash, roll, and use some spells, but it is slow paced and clunky compared to other current action-RPGs. There are many exciting boss battles and combat sequences, but most of the combat is clunky and repetitive. That being said, the amount of content, open world, graphics and story of Witcher 3 are outstanding. There is so, so much to do, the story is engrossing with many choices that actually matter and impact the story, and I had the most fun exploring the open world. The side quests are also all meaningful, with unique scenarios and actually fleshed out characters (instead of fetch quests with carbon copy NPCs like almost every other action RPG). The story and exploration of the beautiful open world kept me going through the game, even if the combat was mostly boring for me. Overall, I would say the Witcher 3 is worth playing for fans of action-RPGs, and those looking for a good story in a game. However, if you are not a fan of the genre, this game won't sway you.",7,2018-02-12,PLAYSTATION 4,user
UchihaBawb,"Geralt is a badass and this game portrays him better than he's ever been portrayed before.... I played this game in 2017 and therefore late on the scene. I picked up the Game of the Year edition at a steal and what a steal it was; I felt like I was Geralt himself walking around a peasants house helping myself to the families weekly meals! Anyway, this game will not fail you and you will get more than your monies worth of hours out of it. It holds up still to this day as being one of the best RPGs of the last decade with so much depth. The NPCs, the humour, crafting, magic, stories and scenery are a small part of the highlights. As I'd already heard, read and watched some positive reviews of this game my expectations were high and I was not disappointed. I actually played this game on it's hardest difficulty (Death March) which only added to the gameplay. Although this game was a couple of years old at the time, it was still in my top 3 gaming experience of the whole of 2017. Loved it so much I bought **** ornament so I never forget.

It has a story so quality, and characters who you really care about, and that 60-100 hours of gameplay of the main missions just simply fly. When you are playing this game, you don't feel like it's a videogame, you feel like you are in a different world. Who is this game for: people who like quality story, with excellent twists. People who like upgrading and generally taking care about their character.

visiblelight7,"Just gave witcher 3 on another chance. finished heart of stone but forced myself. It's wasn't awesome. Out of the 10 hours, I maybe enjoyed 90 minutes in total. The begining was really exciting and I liked how you unexpectedly get captured after killing the frog prince in the sewers and are sent to be executed by a cult who think that you killed their messiah. That was the coolest plot. Unfortunately, that's all there was that was. The main game: Wild Hunt had nothing interesting except the plot with the King and his wife which I am not going into detail but that too only lasted 2 hours. I played aprox 18 hours after that and it was incredibly boring repetitive: just chase after a girl named ciri from town to town and do mindless fetch quests after fetch quests with some really boring cutscenes which I considered FILLER material. The main story was dragging with nothing really substantial to keep me interested. Now that was the ""best"" part of my review... The open world design is incredibly well done and spectacular to look at. But exploring it was ruined due to **** character control design. I really cannot fathom how **** the people at CD project red must've been to think that it's okay for character movements to be buggy like this. To this effect, the camera movement and character controls ruined the experience for me. The quests were not fun as others made them out.... it was the same repetitive stuff as any other mmo just with cutscenes in between. I think what makes the game feel incredible is just the beautiful graphics and design of the open world. Unfortunately, exploring it **** due to the fact that the viewing angle on the character didn't feel immersive for my taste and the moving geralt was annoying. The character makes unecessary movements, awful horse collision detection etc. Most buildings are not explorable and when you do go inside one, it's a PAIN IN THE ASS to explore them because the camera + character movements are horribly done(incredibly frustrating and tiring to move around). Also, there were far too many uncessary loot items everywhere it got confusing but what made it worse **** inventory management and menu which was really tiring to oversee. Each time I had to look at the map or find an item, it was a lengthy process of reloading the menu, flipping through tabs(input lag on each one).

Witcher 3 combines the very best mechanics from games like RDR, GTA and Mount & Blade to create the ultimate immersive gaming experience. The storytelling is brilliant and the content of main missions + side quests and collectables is massive. You can build you character skillset as you like, craft pretty much anything and explore pretty much anywhere. There’s many, many hours of fun packed into this open-world stunner. One of my favourite moments of Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is when you fight monsters so tough that you really need to study them closely (in the bestiary) to out play them. It’s both so frustrating bot so rewarding when you finally conquer evil. Witcher 3 has found the perfect balance of really providing a very fun and addictive game together with being a true challenge that forces you to get deep into the game mechanics. As it’s supposed to be! You can create potions, oils and bombs to help you in battle. What didn’t work in RDR in relation to collecting a lot of stuff with nothing to use it for, works really well here. You can feel that CD Project Red has really thought everything very much through and made no shortcuts. I get amazed every time I play this game by the massiveness of it, by the game mechanics, by the well told storyline and by the beautiful sights around the diverse landscapes. I’ve taken SO MANY screenshots of beautiful mountain, city or ocean scenery etc. I love this game! Last but not least, when you buy the game in a box, CD Project Red gives both stickers and a letter of thanksgiving for buying their game.

jamalt,"The best thing about Witcher 3 is right away, you can tell the developers really cared about the product they were putting out. It's such an enjoyable game, that almost a year later I still haven't quite finished it yet. Because its not about getting to the end, but the journey there. I love Geralt's dry wit and in general every developed characters personality. Yeah, of course some of the side quests are generic but with a world this huge they can't develop every little story line. The Witcher series doesn't need another positive review, but I wrote one anyway because the people that created this game and the author Sapkowski deserve that praise.",9,2017-11-11,PLAYSTATION 4,user
SuperDuck23,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a vast and imaginative RPG that utilises all of the genre’s strengths, while also telling a fascinating story that is expertly interwoven with the gameplay through great dialogue scenes and delightful menu text. The game is huge when taking into account all of the side quests and extras, but the world feels so rich that these additional objectives never feel insubstantial. It's certainly a slow-burn, but the payoffs feel worth it thanks to a fantastic set of characters and well-judged pacing.",10,2017-11-07,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Mr_NobodyV,"I actually didn't expect alot from The Witcher 3 when i bought it, mainly because i am not a fan of fantasy video games filled with dwarfs, elves and magic. Yet, after playing more than 120 hours, i realised that The Witcher 3 - is the best video game of this generation and no, its is not overrated or overhyped, its because these kind of games are released once in many years and are actually worth every cent of its price. Story - nothing sayed, you need to fully experience on your own. Graphics - amazing for a video game, that is filled with over 200 hours of content. Gameplay - could be better, but you will surely love it once you finally learn its every secret.",10,2017-11-03,PLAYSTATION 4,user
mldbas,"9.5 out of 10 One of the best games that I have ever played. At first you might find the game a little complicated as you have different abilities and lots of different stuff and categories in your inventory which is confusing, but after a while playing the game, you notice you have lots of options in approaching a fight which is really nice. The only thing that keeps me from giving a 10 is that after the main story you cannot find almost any of the main people you knew and even if you can find some, there cannot be any conversation.",9,2017-10-30,PLAYSTATION 4,user
DonManias,"Rating a game with a 10 is no easy deed, given that nothing is perfect - ever. This game does have its setbacks, and in my opinion one of them is the actual fighting, which is too action-oriented for the nature of the game. This is, basically, the only negative comment that I have for Witcher 3. What makes this game a 10 is everything else: a more engaging story than anything since Baldur's Game 3 is the strongest point. Although we live in a time where traditional turn-based RPGs are very few and not as exciting, this game managed something that, to me, seemed impossible: making an RPG game that can stand up to the unique experience of the RPG games of old. Merely by means of its storytelling, this is a game that everyone that does not absolutely despise fantasy, should play. Furthermore, this game is exceptionally good in all its other aspects. A vast, real, alive world, with incredible production vlaues that can only compared to those of the GTA series, only this is better. Excellent graphics that will make you doubt where all these millions spent by Bethesda for games like Fallout end up being spent, user friendy gameplay (for all levels and difficutlies), and written dialogue of the highest literary quality. I cannot but recommend this game for its achievements, which have apparently made it the winner of hundreds of awards, and I strongly believe that any person who respects gaming should try it. For RPG fans, I have one final comment: this may actually be better than Baldur's Gate II...! I have not decided whether it is. but i never thought that contemplating this thought would even be possible, what with all the ""open world"" sandbox RPGs they sell these days, which focus on graphics, graphics and forget to tell a story.

EricDean,"Let me preface this by saying I am not giving the Witcher 3 a low score because I think its scores are too high. I DO think they are too high but this is my honest opinion and thoughts on the Witcher 3. The Witcher 3 is a beautiful game... on PC. One thing I hated while playing this on PlayStation 4 is that they had dulled the graphics down to a point where there was no point in making it about the graphics but they still pushed it to a point where it struggles to run on average PS4s. The fact that the game was constantly dipping into the 20 FPS range was not good and made a mediocre game even worse. Let's see, the universe is all right. The story is absolutely dog **** and confusing but if you ignore it and look around at the universe then that's the enjoyable part. The story is just so bland there's no point in praising it. The story is just an excuse for the horrible gameplay. Go here because A said so. Well B isn't where A said he was better find him. Oh C told me B is over at D. Turns out B isn't at D better find B. That's the level of depth we're talking about here. The actual gameplay is super boring. It's slow, clunky, and a mixture of too easy and hard. I was able to beat a boss standing still with my thumb on one button but as soon as I see a level 1 dog I'm dead because it just runs by and attacks me similar to an AoE attack without slowing down. Geralt is too slow to do anything. Buy the game to say you played it but save the reciept.",5,2017-10-17,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Gittoplo,"Great game but I hated the inventory. Swords and gear do not really seem to make the difference. Skyrim beats it hands down when it comes to that aspect. Music gets a bit repetitive.

It makes opponents feel like sponges, able to absorb ridiculous amounts of damage and results in really long fights. If you don't care about that or enjoy playing on lower difficulties, you'll probably enjoy this game. It's a shame because I've read and enjoyed all of the Witcher books, and the story felt good up to the point I quit playing. There's a vast amount of side quest that will take you about 100 hours to finish. They are often based on Slavic folklore and fully deserve the name ""quest"". I think that's the biggest pro of this game, which is why I'm rating it this high even though I've only completed about 20% of it.",7,2017-09-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user
filipers,"Wow....what a ride it has been!!! After i spent around 110 hours in this masterpiece i was finally able to beat the game! I know that i was a bit too late to play this game (almost 2 years) but i was finally able to play it! I have always been a fan of rpgs, i felt in love with games like skyrim and fallout, the freedom and the sense of building your own character and create your story were the highlights in those games, but since the witcher is a rpg were you roleplay as Geralt and not a character that you create i was always with a step back on buying it, but now i have 0 regrets! Now lets talk about what made me love this game. First of all its characters, never in my life i have been so emotionally connected to fictional characters in video games! I actually cared for Ciri, Geralt, and the fate of his friends! Actually it is the first time in a video game that made me cry, i have never tought that this game was so emotional, especially after you find ciri!The protagonist, Geralt of Rivia, is a wonderful character, i really enjoyed his personality! The world is gorgeous, and huge! The side quests are very interesting and not fetch quests like major open world games, it is not like ""go to point A and kill those monsters"", the quests are very more complex than that and the decisions you make (that are hard as **** there is no good and evil) have a huge impact in the world! The soundtrack is outstanding, since skyrim that i have not played a game with such a gorgeous soundtrack!The combat system is simple but effective i always loved to rely on my signs like quen and aard! The armors are very well designed! And now i will talk about some other matters that i didn't apreaciate in this game (that are very few) but enought to not give a 10 to this game. First of all the skill tree, i didn't really liked, i think that we were very limited to just have 4 skills trees, the combat, the signs (my favourite), the alchemy (i didn't apreciated it though :/ ) and general, if we compare it to skyrim this is very limited, but i somewhat understand it since here we play as geralt, a witcher, not some mage, thief, assassin etc. And the other factor is that it wasn't very natural to me to been doing the side quests and play gwent since we were on a desesperate mission trying to find Ciri, so it means besides the importance of Geralt task to find Ciri he always had some free time to collect some cards or do some monster contracts. xD In the end it was such an amazing experience, after i beat the game i felt such an emptiness inside because i was really going to miss Geralt adventures and his pals Dandelion and Zoltan, i think that i will starT reading the books to envolve even more in this lore! One of the best Rpgs that i have ever played, in pair with Skyrim ( diferent games but both amazing!), congrats to CdProjeck Red for making such a masterpiece!

moonman1994,The Witcher 3 is simply an amazing game. It's as near to a perfect game as I've ever played the only flaw is that the combat can get somewhat repetitive but that is an extremely minor flaw as the many different missions and sub-stories keep it from getting as repetitive as Skyrim (also a great game but it suffers more from the repetitive flaw). Battle System: 8.5/10: It's a lot of fun and you feel like you've got solid control over your character. It can be a little button-mashy at times but for the most part not in a negative way. A very solid 3rd person battle system. Graphics/World Design: 10/10. The world is beautiful and there are many rich regions to explore each complete with their own lore. The main story is great but the secondary tales that flesh out each region are so good you sometimes forget to continue on with the main story. Truly The Witcher 3 manages to craft a world that you want to dive head first into. The graphics are also quite good. Everything you'd expect from a PS4 game. Soundtrack: 9.5/10. Honestly my only complaint about the soundtrack is that we don't hear the music more often. The music is good and fits the game nothing is overly epic for the battle you are having and it works to draw you more into the game. Story: 10/10. The story and the sub-stories are great. In fact the open world sub-stores are so good that they can end up distracting you from the main story! Despite this each subplot feels like it has purpose and your decisions in how you approach these can effect the overall story. Also the ability to play both as Gareth and Ciri adds an extra touch of greatness to the story. Side Quests/Bonus Material: 9.5/10 It's great as I've said already. The extra stories are awesome. The witcher contracts get a little repetitive but they all have individual stories so it is bearable and you still feel accomplished completing each one. Misc: Pretty much all covered above. All else I can mention is the crafting system which is easy to use and very useful and I would give it a 9.5/10 as well. Summery: The only bad thing about The Witcher 3 is that I didn't play it earlier. It truly is a great game and does the open world right without sacrificing story. There are few things I feel it could have done better. Overall score: 10/10,10,2017-09-09,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Kuroneko87,"This game came out 2 years **** still towers high above other titles that came out today. I'm just gonna point out the good things and the bad. The Good: The game is enormous, the world full of little details, tons and tons of quests,npc's. landmarks, big cities (similar to Assassins creed...expect the world isn't empty like those crap games I bet you can take all 21 Assassins creed games together, and it still won't have as much content as The Witcher 3. You can easily spent hundreds of hours in this game especially on higher difficulties (and there is New Game +) The story and characters are done really well, every quest has in-game cinematic's and are fully **** makes make you feel more emerged in the world and more connected to the characters. The graphic are amazing, it's the closest things to a believable living breathing world. And i don't know any game that has surpassed this game graphical wise (maybe Horizon zero dawn?) The Bad: Well not necessarily bad but i think the combat could have been done allot better, it can feel akward and buggy at ****'s a bit similar to assassins creed and Batman combat. But it does feel satisfying to chop off heads and limbs in slowmotion. Bugs! Well most of the game breaking bugs have been fixed by **** like all open-world games it's never gonna be bug free! so expect to see some weird things from time to time. Verdict: Really worth picking up, don't hesitate. PS: If the game gets too easy at some point you can allow low level mobs to auto-scale with your level, so now every fight takes longer than 5 **** can toggle this on in the options menu (took a while before i found out)",10,2017-09-01,PLAYSTATION 4,user

FrozenCB,"I love this game for its story, the world, and characters. However, the gameplay left me wanting for something a bit better. When the game works with me, it works. It feels nice, looks nice, and is something that I could play for a very long time. However, I am then **** on by the game's movement system and weird combat issues I have. My issues concern the difficulty and mechanical problems that I have. The movement has been annoying so many times that I've learned to just accept it and move on. So for me, this makes the game feel not very fun with the amount of traveling you do. I abhor the swimming and underwater sections. Your horse seems to just perform a full stop over a small rock, or a sharp turn on trees, or fences whose actual space in the world affects the riding mechanic. I've played on Death March. So many people advertise this as the correct way to the play the game. For me, it ended up being a sponge-fest of prepping for the battles when there were a lot of enemies (spam them with bombs), or a big boss fight whose A.I I haven't triggered yet (alchemy and signs). It all blended into Quen, using the same potions and oils. Wait for my moment and attack when necessary. It was good the first hour, it then became repetitive and routine. The story and characters were what made it all worthwhile in the end. That is essentially the only good thing about this game for me. It's a solid story on top of a base that is ready to crumble and crack based on my experiences. So for me, the game is above average. That is because of what you will be spending most of your time doing, which is exploring and doing quests.",6,2017-08-25,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The amount of voice work and motion capture is truly incredible. This game puts others to shame. The gameplay is also fun in a beat-em up kind of way. The game lets you play with different styles and I chose fast and agile. By the final boss, I felt like I was playing on easy mode. Animations could have been smoother for the protagonist but then I say that about every game. The inventory system was the only negative. This was a real throwback to a bad time in inventory and shop management. It would be better to leave all the rusty swords on the ground and let the protagonist focus on the story.

ithinkiplaygame,"I went into The Witcher 3 with such high hopes, with everyone praising it as the best game ever made. Basically no one had said a single bad thing about it, and anyone who did was shouted down as an idiot. However, this game was BAD. Like, legitimately terrible. It seems like for how much graphic polish they gave the game, the rest of the game was an afterthought. The main ""story"" is a pitiful excuse, you just go and chase after a random character you're given no reason to care about, playing as a character you feel like you have no control over. There is so little choice, and the dialogue choices you do get are vague and often opposite to what I expected. At one point, I was trying to peacefully settle a conflict, and when asked where I was going, I chose, ""none of your business,"" and then Mr. Generic RPG Man decided that meant **** off and die."" Which leads to the combat. It is the actual worst RPG combat I've ever seen. Mash square, sometimes press trigger to take less damage while mashing square. The entire combat system is designed around one-on-one fights, with parries and rolls, which you can never use because every encounter is with 3+ enemies swarming you, blocking your movement. The map is boring, bland, and large for no good reason. The game does exactly what Assasin's Creed and its ilk do, by scattering meaningless side objectives and **** fetch quests across a map that was five times larger than it needed to be so they could advertise its ""expansive open world."" The side quests always boil down to ""get a thing"" or ""kill a thing and get its thing,"" and while their stories are supposed to be interesting, they aren't. Moving around the map itself is sluggish and boring. You can move as slow as molasses on foot, making navigating the once again too large towns and cities a chore, or call your magic teleporting horse to move around slightly faster, with a tiny stamina bar of actually going a satisfying speed. I like the idea of your horse following paths automatically, but every path is a weird branching system of unnecessary ways to go, which of course your horse always chooses. Then, comes Gwent. I hate Gwent. I HATE Gwent. It is the actual worst game-inside-a-game I've seen since Caravan in Fallout: New Vegas. The rules are cryptic and stupid, and the game forces you to play it on multiple occasions, scattering dumb cards across the map. Many times I'd do a side quest, to get a glorified Yugioh card as my prize. How did people like Gwent enough to actually warrant a standalone game of it? In summary, The Witcher 3 is an overhyped, overly large, overrated, bloated, boring, repetitive mess ****.

The few games I've enjoyed most in the (more or less recent) past were titles like GTA V, Far Cry 3 & 4 and Gran Turismo. Let me just say: I was fooled by the good reviews. Game of the year and whatnot. Surely, this must be an enjoyable experience, for some innocent soul looking to spend a few hours of his precious remaining lifetime on a video game? There must be something in it for everybody, right? Considering the rave reviews?? Right??? So I gave this festering heap of nerd dookie a shot. Played it for I don't know, 5, 10, 12 hours? I couldn't even keep track of the time because I kept nodding off. I don't understand what they want from me in this game. I really don't. Why I should invest my time figuring out if I could brew some kind of... potion or lotion or ointment or oil or whatnot out of some mushrooms and flowers and slain monster entrails that I picked up a thousandfold along the way, stumbling through this fantasy wonderland that's supposed to be ""open world"", only I can't do a thing that I would really do in the real open world. I'm an adult with a real job and with real stuff I have to know, review, and study from scratch to stay on top of things, why the everloving **** would I want to spend my time studying and perfecting this completely made up nonsense?

RandomWhorie,"¿Mejor juego de la historia o un ñordo sobrevalorado? yo digo lo primero pues lo segundo está reservado para la mayoría de juegos de Nintendo con sus MARIOnetas que ni es fontanero ni es na, pues juega a tenis/fútbol/baloncesto/golf/atletismo además es un complinche del otro salvaprincesas, LINKER a quien le pregunta dónde está Zelda y él responde: ""¿quien cojones es Zelda?"". El videojuego del cual estoy puntuando aquí y ahora es espectacular se mire por donde se mire, desde los páramos desérticos sin nada hasta los bosques imponiendo yuyu repletos de monstruos, pasando por unos diálogos reforzados con letras diminutas pa que no se vea na de na, ¿para qué si la mayor parte del tiempo estás hablando con gente desconocida? A esto ya que saco el tema decir que hace falta sacarse algún novel de lectura o ser de letras o algo para entender la historia. Ya sé que está basado en un libro pero no es excusa para que no te lo cuenten bien, faltan una barbaridad de cosas y eso con su duración es imperdonable, muchas misiones mata-monstruos y cien-mil horas de diálogo para nada. Lo mejor es quizás su ambientación en éste aspecto recalcar que la versión Wild Hunt es más melancólica y funciona mejor con la historia comparadolo con su expansión Blood and Wine, pero igual está bien siendo una trama alternativa. En fin que me enrollo mas que las persianas de un burdel novigradense (toma gentilicio).",10,2017-07-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user

In any case, I played about 10 hours on PS4 and gave up, and I've recently rediscovered it on PC with a controller, really getting it this time. Once the combat mechanics click they really are good. Everything else is top class too, voice acting, story, graphics, all amazing. Do all the side quests, they are so well written.

Its very good at fitting the hemisphere, and making you understand the atmosphere. The game play was not that good. The character movement was a bit clunky. Repetetive attack animation. What i like about it was the signs and blocking. So to the enemies; They were particulary the same, and not very little diversity (atleast when i playedtrough). The huge let down of this game is the loading screen. Yep you heard it right. And no ""just get good"". I took a timer, and it was over a whole miniute, A MINUTE. Dialoug was good.

La escala del mundo abierto: se desaprovecha tanto espacio con un sistema de combate tan pobre. El rendimiento: La exploracion: es aburrido todo se torna tedioso por culpa de los sentidos de brujo, el jugador no tiene que hacer nada solo seguir el color rojo.

hinter1,"Another praising review for CD Project Red's masterpiece. Witcher 3 is teaching the industry of how games should be done. A stunning achievement. What makes this game really stand out, aside beautiful graphics, awesome story and cinematic combat style is Geralt's character creation. Different to every other RPG protagonist. He's not a superhero, not a dragonborn, not the chosen one. He has human characteristics - despite the fact that he's a mutant. A little bit cynic at times, with great sense of humor. It looks simple, but this is what makes Geralt really enjoyable to play. You could be him.",10,2017-06-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user

ADIposiDAS,"Since I bought my PS3 in 2009 I played about 60+ games on the Playstation platform (PS3 and PS4). Among my favourite games and game series are The Last Of Us, Uncharted, God Of War, Mass Effect, Heavy Rain, Deus Ex, Dishonored, Hitman and Splinter Cell. I have never considered myself a RPG fan but I enjoyed some RPGs in the past (I absolutely loved Gothic). Since Witcher 3 has such a high metascore I thought that I would enjoy it as well even though it is a RPG. Technical kinks aside (controls, camera etc.) I have to say that this game was just not for me. I appreciate when games have a lot of story to tell and The Witcher is full of nice little and not so little stories but the game seriously lacks gameplay. For me there was no sense of accomplishment. The game constantly gives you detailed instructions where to go and what to do. Even the fighting was no real challenge.

Kamikazeshocki,This game is a masterpiece in general and one of the most impressive games of this decade. This is a rolemodel in gaming development. Just buy it and enjoy. I spent 180 hours in it (together with all DLC) and the world and the screenplay is amazing. The only things I have to mention is that your character will get overpowered and the fights become easy. Also in general the combat is way inferior compared to Bloodborne and despite being in awe with Witcher 3 I have to admit I was not infatuated with this game like I was with Bloodborne. So I love the latter one more in the end.,10,2017-05-07,PLAYSTATION 4,user

dr0nzer,"If you're looking at this game you've probably already know of the reviews and the praise the title has received, and yes it's a beautifully crafted world with great story, dialogue, acting and depth, but I see a lot of the game's tech is outdated, the massive use of ""cards"" for foliage, collision detection system isn't great, jump animation is questionable and horse travelling is just hard work and at times frustrating, it feels better to run on your own two feet instead.. the combat can feel a little unrefined, it's not as smooth as you would have liked or expected, it's also worth mentioning that the load times can be ridiculous, bordering on 5-10mins onwards for some scenes. The game world itself is massive, the content is non other than exceptional and definitely sets the bar for an RPG, the quest system is great and the choices given can at times make you think. The game will easily sink you in for over 100+ hours and this is just mainly doing the story and a few additional quests and exploration activities here and there.

This game feels like a long adventure with many unforgettable quests and stories. I usually do not like side quests in open world games because they are repetitive and do not have anything interesting storywise. But here you are getting so many little stories with surprising attentions to details. The main quest is intriguing but the ending is not perfect in my opinion. It is understandable that developers didn't have so much money compare to other companies so they could not do something epic in the end but it does not make a game any worse. Also, you MUST get expansions. Heart of Stone and Blood and Wine are surpassed in some things main game. I loved stories in these expansions.

silverXXwolf,"The Witcher 3 is an exceptionally well-crafted game, and a sure bet for any RPG fan. Projekt Red masterfully blends exciting quests and game-play with a vast, open-world that is ripe for exploration and saturated with content-rich experiences. The main quest is an ambitious adventure involving numerous characters through-out various regions, and the side-quests are equally engaging. With that said, I've docked 1 point for the following reasons: - The swimming mechanics and close-quarters combat are clumsy and glitchy at times. - The main character has no personality, and speaks every word of dialogue in a painfully monotone voice. - You may be disappointed if you're looking for the endless thrills **** sandbox. Once the story and various side-quests are completed, its replay value diminishes much quicker than higher-octane sandbox titles. Aside from that, I've had an absolute blast with this game.

prince_warhero,"The game is great in following things - Amazing graphics, with very detailed environment , day night cycle . Nice character models overall very impressive visually - The story is amazing and characters are great. A true fantasy world that deals with all sorts of political, racist etc other issues that few games dare to. Thats all thats the only thing i like about the game.. now for the things i dislike - 75% of game is go from point A -> B then see a cutscene, rinse and repeat - Combat and movement is clunky and its just a two button mash combat, where is rpg combat like skyrim, the inventory system is very tedious to use - There is no exploration aspect in the game , every little thing is marked on map. So it again makes me feel like i am just walking from point to point seeing the mini map and then triggering cutscenes thats all.. Its better if this game is a movie because a game should offer good and variety gameplay and this game fails to do that.. but since the story is great with multiple choices,endings and because of graphics i give a 7/10. Will give a 6.5 but cant score like that in metacritic i guess.",7,2017-04-07,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Radoslavus,"I do not consider **** player, especially a game expert. I just like to play video games on medium or sometimes on a higher difficulty level. More for fun, relaxation and storyline than pure competition. Therefore, I often avoid multiplayer clashes that rob me of the two reasons for playing. I'm just an average player who has come in contact with some titles. One I liked more, the other less, some frustrated me, and yet others pulled in enough that after a few years I even came back to them. Many of the hits I din't even play and probably that will never change. I can think of myself as a fan of rpg and I can not properly dress in words, HOW MUCH DID I HATE CD PROJEKT RED FOR THE WITCHER 3 The announcements were boisterous, conferences, interviews and marketing were thought out, even the slow and fueling cinematics made me feel impressed. I live in this world for too long to be immune to omnipresent hype. So I waited, since the May premiere I closed in a tight cage of internet ignorance. I have not read, watched, and looked at a single: review, rating, comment, and opinion on the latest CDP production. I persisted for 3 months, and believe me it was not easy, I finally bought it and played it. (on a PS4 btw). What were my feelings, impressions, opinions? The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt pulled me in my chair so deep that almost for a month I became an antisocial zombie. During the game, I wanted to check the next marker, discover what is behind the next rock, river, hill, ect. Discovering another entrance to the cave led to the same excitement as when I saw a Christmas tree surrounded by gifts. Many times during my trip with Geralt I stopped to watch the breathtaking views. During breaks from The Witcher, I wondered how the story of Geralt and Ciri would unfold, how the fate of Velen, Novigrad and Skellige will resolve, and whether I made good decision. Many times I wondered if I was ready to defeat this monster who had mercilessly dumped me last time ... Okay, last seven times. The marker still shows that I am weaker than him, (and with this level cacan't beat him or it), but maybe this time it's possible (in the rhythm of great music during the fight) I will be able to do it. In short, The Witcher 3 dragged me into it's world without a doubt. So why I hate the Reds and their latest production? CD Projekt released his latest child, and unknowingly done a great harm to many players. They lifted the bar too high. Maybe I'm in the minority, but when I decided to play the Witcher I robbed myself of those things that would make me happy playing any other productions. I will unintentionally compare them to the latest Witcher, and the winner of this battle will be known before it starts. Is it perfect? Of course not, there is no such thing as a prefect game. But it's essential in every gamers collection.",10,2017-04-04,PLAYSTATION 4,user

It’s an incredibly boring game. In action-RPG games, combat is the foundation. I simply did not enjoy the combat and as a result, I got bored within 5 hours and didn’t bother continuing. When it comes to video games; if it isn’t fun for me, then I rate low every time.

raccoondaddy,"The Witcher 3 is a masterpiece, that sets you into a world of darkness, beauty and wonders that NO OTHER GAME HAS DONE. Geralt (the main character), is the most likeable stoic character to ever grace literary world. (Yeah, this started out as a fantasy novel series.) At first, he may seem like some bland badass, that everyone has done; but you'd find yourself being dead wrong!! TW3 takes the main story and blends it well into the world and most of the side quests you partake in. Along with its main character, the supporting cast, weaves a tale that is full of majesty, suspense and horror. The best way to truly describe the world; think of the show, ONCE: Upon a Time, except a little bit like game of thrones, except with more monsters. Minor drawbacks like, visual glitches and a complex combat system can mar your experience. Aside from that, you are truly getting an EPIC story and is probably the only game where the DLC is worth EVERY PENNY and could've just been another game.

madscientist4,"RPG lover here. I enjoy getting lost in fantasy worlds highlighted by good writing. A couple quick random things: If the atmosphere of a land at war containing all that comes from a brutal war bothers you then give this game some time before you drop it. I didn't like this at first but then after I gave it 5 or 6 hours I got used to it. Humor does show up now and then to give some relief. So hang in there and give this game a chance. Also if you are like me and don't care to get stressed out while gaming, you can set the difficulty level at any time. If normal becomes too hard you can change it to easy at any point in the game. I loved this for when I wanted to just chill and lose myself in the story. This game was amazing all the way from character presentation and design to the writing. The only reason it doesn't get a 10 is that some of the side quests get repetitive(go to X...follow trail using witcher senses to ****). Also dialog options with key NPCs were limited. Games like Dragon Age Inquisition had a lot of dialog options with key NPCs and it helped to connect the players with the characters more. The Witcher 3 does not necessarily suffer from this, especially if you've played the previous games or read the books but for someone new to the series it may have helped to have some more dialog options to connect them more to the characters. In the game they portrayed Geralt, Ciri, Yennefer, and Triss very much like the books do. I recommend reading the books before or while playing this game as there are some story lines that you'll get that you wouldn't get if you hadn't read the books. Combat: honestly, I don't care. It's not my personal interest although some people are really into to it so from what I could tell on easy and normal settings it was fun. There are other reviews that'll go deeper into this for those interested. Crafting and inventory management were not as tedious as some games but complex enough to satisfy the CRPG fan in me. DLCs for the most part are free so make sure to download them. The Expansions such as Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine are not free but reasonably priced. I played through both and didn't find them as fun as the main story. If you are a huge Witcher fan you'll want to play them, if not I'd recommend doing a second play through the main game. This is one of the best RPGs I have ever played. It was fun to be Geralt of Rivia for the 60+ hours it took to finish the game. I recommend it to any RPG fan or anyone wanting to step into the genre(although it will give you unreasonably high expectations for every other game).",9,2017-03-22,PLAYSTATION 4,user

demonalter852,This GAME! MY GOD WHERE TO START! i'm going to put it into prospective of creating a chart of pros and cons of this game pros - amazing story and tons of quests (deep world to play in) - 100 to 200 hrs of game play (i think its a pro in my opinion) -amazing combat and variety of ways to approach your target - don't need to go into order from the first game -beautiful graphics and scenery -huge and deep world -great ports for all platforms (best is pc) - the character you play as is not BORING! - crafting in this game is simple and easy -awesome rpg elements - hard game for new comers to the series (depends on what difficulty you are playing on) cons - stupid roach overall get this game if you are into the rpg genre i rated this 10/10 just because its a personal favorite of mine and to the rpg genre,10,2017-03-16,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Dukemang,"I never thought to give this game a try when it was first released and i regret that decision. The Witcher 3 uses so many RPG elements excellently throughout the entirety of the story. A massive world, many unique side-quests, memorable characters and a well put together story. Not to mention the amazing DLC that has been made for this game as well. I haven't played an RPG like this in awhile and have to say it definitely hits home for any big RPG player like myself.",10,2017-03-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user

estebambuco,"Solo quiero decir que el juego es lo más recomendado en PS4 si estas acostumbrado a RPGs largos: 1. Cuando compre el juego y lo abrí me lleve una sorpresa que no me esperaba. Me dieron un mapa, un CD de banda sonora, un panfleto que explicaba varios aspectos del mundo de the witcher, la verdad fue mi primera experiencia en un juego de RPG en consola. Además escondido entre todo eso había una nota de agradecimiento por parte de CDProjektRED STUDIO. 2. Una excelente banda sonora 3. Las mejores misiones secundarias de cualquier juego que haya jugado. Misiones secundarias y terciarias que tienen una historia más profunda que muchos juegos que he jugado y que después cuando pasabas por el lugar de donde hiciste esa misión secundaria veías las consecuencias de la decisión que tomaste respecto a esa zona. 4. Las decisiones en el juego tenían bastante peso y de verdad te sentías eligiendo. 5. Me encanto el universo de The Witcher: las brujas, monstruos, humanos, hombres lobo, vampiros, almas, fantasmas, aberraciones, historias, armas, personajes, etc. 6. La historia principal es excelente, me encantó Ciri uno de los personajes centrales o casi el personaje central en la historia, la sentí viva y que cada decisión buena o mala que tomará podría afectarla 7. Me encantaron los enemigos y la forma en que me los presentaron: las historias que me mostraban detrás de ellos, la forma en que me podía enfrentar a ellos, que les hacía daño, que poderes podía usar, etc 8. Gráficas vivas acorde con los sonidos, por ejemplo cuando estás en un bosque el sonido que hace el viento sobre la grama se siente como si estuvieras ahí. 9. Te dan ganas de jugarlo una y otra vez 10. Los mejores DLC que han salido en un juego de PS4 Contras: Mal sistema de niveles por ejemplo un enano que debería ser facilito matarlo aparecen muchas veces en un nivel superior por ejemplo 30 y es capaz de matarte de un golpe, mientras que un basilisco es de menor nivel y más fácil matarlo, no tiene mucho sentido la verdad. Otro es que debió haber sido el protagonista un aprendiz o algo así que uno sienta que esta subiendo de nivel porque Geralt de nivel 1 se siente como si fuera el mismo Geralt en nivel 40 sin cambios con la misma sabiduría. Por último los objetos son un desorden en el menú, muchísimos objetos que no sabes si te servirán o no, demasiados parecido al sistema de fallout 4 con un monton decosas que tienen y no tienen utilidad porque te podrían servir para hacer una armadura o crear una poción pero hacen ver desorganizado el menú. Cuando consigues una nueva arma que se ve superior es porque el sistema le subió unos puntos de ataque y de características, siempre encuentras una espada mejor que la anterior. No hay nada de multijugador pero eso a quien le importa la verdad. Las contras son estupideces al lado del gran juego, lo recomiendo mil veces así después me digan que no les gusto, es un juego buenísimo y que merece ser mencionado entre los mejores de la historia.",10,2017-03-08,PLAYSTATION 4,user
mdelolmo,"Should be a 10, yet it is not... I really really enjoyed this game. I did every side mission, tried to level up to the maximum and seen as mach as the world as I could. Everything is enjoyable: Story, graphics, items, character development, combat, mini-games. Nevertheless, the reason I can't give it a 10 is the amount of bugs it has. I could forgive if they were only visual glitches and details, but some of these issues are business logic rules that should always work and break the game if they don't.",9,2017-03-08,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Stevenseagal75,"Do not get deceived by the Fallout 4 fanboys talking trash about this masterpiece in their outdated 1 review account. This game is not perfect but it sure is close to it since the dozen patches fixing almost everything like in inventory system ect.. Also keep in mind you can mod it changing the gameplay making it harder or similar to Dark souls or making the game's graphics look even better. with that said the vanilla gameplay is simple when you're used to it and will most likely not care since all you'll care about is the story and the stories told in this game are inspired from so many cultures all over the globe and from different religions to create a refreshing experience that even the side of a side quest look like a mainquest and the side quests are better than the mainquests IMO were choices still matters and make you think since its not some black and white generic choices but gray that still make you wonder which of the choices are better with the lesser evil ect.. And then the two DLC's are two other masterpieces that feel like a new game especially the B&W expansion with new musics, And speaking of music you'll listen to over a hundred original soundtracks both in exploration and combat that are so good you'll remember them for the rest of your life just like you'll remember the breathtaking cities and lands that feel alive with their own stories to tell and change the mood of the game. So after doing 5 playthroughs both in vanilla and modded with 3 of this playthroughs on a pirated version i immediately bought the game when i could to play it even more with 408 more hours on steam with probably a total of 1000 hours. So i can say this is most certainly the best game ever created and i can't wait for cyberpunk2077. Go buy this game now.",10,2017-03-08,PLAYSTATION 4,user
KingPorky,"I expected a lot more from this game, i mean, i was expecting a amazing open world with amazing possibilities, but turns out that was just a ok open world experience for me. Exploration was killed thanks to the ""?"" landmarks on the map, the horse playability is **** awful and really bad to control; this game is also very bland from a technical perspective, there is a lot of glitches and bugs, to be fair this is kinda common on open world games, but some of them are just really annoying and one particulary almost made me stop from playing it. The story, at least for me, was pretty boring and forgetful, the quest to find Ciri gets annoying real quick, and the formula is just: watch some cutscene and dialogues, fight some enemies, find some stuff, fight more enemies... and so on, the choice system is not much o relevant, at least on main quest, since the only choices that really matters are the ones that happens at when you're almost finishing it. For the positive side, i really like the sidequests and there is a lot of items to collect and things to do even after you beat the game, but i lost my save file so in order to pick the items i have to play that game again, and this won't be happening, at leasy by now. In conclusion i think that Witcher 3 has some great aspects, but it0 is incredible overhyped and i dont think it really deserves the praise.",7,2017-03-08,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Не понятно по чьей вине большинство плюсов перечеркивают эти же минусы. Мир большой, но исследовать его после пары часов игры не хочется, сюжет к концу скатывается в примитивщину, а боевка, которая по сравнению с прошлыми частями выглядит большим скачком вперед, все такая же кривая и топорная. На 3 уровне сложности из-за Руны ""квен"" становится очень легко играть и почти никакой противник не представляет угрозы.

t0mmyg,"I'm certainly in the minority here but I didn't much fancy my time with The Witcher 3. I'll start with the positives, Great graphics, sound, music voice acting. The World felt huge and alive. Now for the negative, boring monotone protaganist gave me little insentive to care about the story. Mature themes felt awkward not exciting. The combat was beyond clunky. Enemies were uninteresting and bland. The spells had no appeal or flash. The menus were combersome. The inventory was filled with way too many items that served no purpose until dozens of hours into the game. Repairing items was a frustrating nightmare. The ""puzzles"" were a lesson in boredom. Seriously using your witcher sense to find clues was such an abysmal waste of time. Swimming sections were nothing but frustration. The difficulty scaling was terrible, mid game fights were often very difficult then suddenly a breeze at end game. The lore felt to me like a game of thrones wannabe, that's just a personal gripe if you are into that sort of genre you'd enjoy it more.

The main plot is about the story of the search for the wizard Geralt by his practically daughter Ciri being an engaging and entertaining story besides its secondary quests that besides several are always surprising giving a practically unlimited life to the game. The game also features incredible graphics and an exciting soundtrack and a range of charismatic and memorable characters that will make you interested in the history of each of them, The Witcher can please everyone from those who like good fighting to those who like Of long dialogues with several options or stop everything and have fun playing Gwent but do not forget to play the one that is the best game of the generation so far.",10,2017-01-26,PLAYSTATION 4,user
SassyQuatch,"Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's high point is in the quality of its story and its well written quests. It truly succeeds in presenting well thought out quests with well written characters who you grow to care about. That being said, to give this game higher than an 8/10 I feel would be to overlook some of its more major flaws. The game packs a more expansive experience than other Western RPGs, but after playing it for a while you'll notice how the game loses some of its potency in the process. Unlike Skyrim and Fallout games, which set quests far off in still as of yet unexplored lands, the quests in this game more often than not involve you fetching items some 100 yards away, or running 50 yards away to smash a button against a somewhat underwhelming beast. To add to the banality of the experience, the quests often use the same sort of structure with different characters substituted in. This results in an eventual boredom with the game that isn't helped by the uneventful, button smashing combat system. Another flaw about this game is in the fickleness of its controls. A lot of the time the Witcher will be standing right next to an item that for some reason he cannot grab despite your pressing the pop-up button. The lock-on system in combat is also unnecessarily problematic. The game eventually dissimilates into a choice machine supplemented by short stints of boring combat. All in all, the good features of this game need hardly be repeated. However, it does seem to be a somewhat overrated game, especially taking into account its inability to provide compelling combat gameplay.",8,2017-01-22,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Calasade,"Me, personally, I think TW3 should have been subtitled Silver Platter because everything is handed to you on said piece of dishware. This is a simple, unchallenging game that offers little in the way of meaningful role-play and does almost everything for you. What the game doesn’t do for you, it instructs you how to do in excruciating detail. Role-playing traditionally makes the player contemplate and relies on intelligence more than the speed of your thumb on a gamepad. Therefore, don’t expect Baldur’s Gate 1 or 2 here. Hell, Witcher 3 is not even Dragon Age: Origins in the intellectual sense. Yet even so, Witcher 3 is not all bad. The game has its pluses (though not nearly so many as the thirty-five million dollar marketing budget and purchased awards would have you believe). The expansion pack Blood and Wine is meh whereas Hearts of Stone rises above the rest. It is a gripping story with hard choices and harder battles and a relationship that is deftly, maturely handled. I am tempted to say Hearts of Stone is worth the purchase price of the entire game, but even its excellence doesn’t validate suffering through the mindlessness of TW 3, which is 80% fluff and takes control away from the gamer at crucial stages to display yet another stupid cut-scene.",2,2017-01-10,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Archulysses,"Story - As prologue, the game continues 6 months after the events of witcher 2 where the older and grizzlier Geralt got his memory back and is now on his path to track and locate his wife Yennefer. The story of this game is awesome and like the Dragon Age and Mass Effect series, follows the very awesome decision making that makes different branching points and consequences. You can make decisions that might like kill another while it will save another, decisions that could make an impact later on in the game and many more. But what is the best thing in this game is that how sidequests are not that generic errand missions, almost every and each sidequests are relevant and affects the main story later on in the game. My favorite in the game are its contract missions, all are long, great boss battles and the various, unique and different ways our protagonist witcher will do to get the upper hand to defeat them. A great ending to a great series. A perfect 10/10 for me. Gameplay - As to this aspect, this game didnt really do that great, it did do good though, first is with regards tor the **** bad. The roads are usually narrow for your horse roach that usuaaly you get stuck at trees, rocks, etc and added the fact that when you whistle for Roach, he always comes out to the WORST places its so dumb, another thing is the quest line guide to missions are bad i dont recommend following them. As to the fighting, its decent in sword fight but I would have liked more customization since you are just stuck on swords. I understand why though. The cons regarding mainly the brawling or when you are fistfighting multiple enemies, the controls or options are bad and annoying when you cant use healing items and you are fighting in a small spaces. Swimming mechanics are subpar too, My biggest problem though is its bugs, there are instances when you cant dive in the water or when you are riding Roach and suddenly an invisible wall occurs which you cant pass but can pass when on foot and many more, However, this game though did showed the BEST Minigame in a game for me ever, **** need to explain why, i encourage you all to try this minigame asap. Overall, a good score of 8/10 will do. Graphics - First of all, i can really say that this is one of the prettiest environment i have seen in the RPG genre (Bloodborne and Dragon Age Inquisition are the only ones who can match it) it is detailed and i like how the weather changes from time to time. As to the characters though, the game has the most number of gorgeous and sexiest female characters ever. Everyone is pretty, had nice ass and **** whatsoever (esp the sorceresses) the guys are another story though since most are either too grizzled, old or generic except the main characters. Regarless, still a good game to look at and deserves a score of 9/10. Music - music wise, damn this is one of the best soundtracks and themes i have ever listened to. Battle theme is good, but my favorite in the in game piece is a song sung by Priscilla in game. Really soothing, I liked the theme also that plays while im just in my boat exploring the Skellige waters. Voice acting is also superb, though i didnt like how the voices of generic characters are reused so much in game. However with regards to the main characters and npcs are good overall, Geralts low voice, Yen's proud voice, ciri's feisty voice and so on. Though i didnt like the voice acting of Triss (she made her look like a good girl archetype which honestly if you played the previous games and read the books, it doesnt fit her character whatsoever) and the change with Dandelion's voice actor which is good but i would have preffered his former voice. Still a decent performance though. A score of 9/10. Total Average = 9 My principle in reviewing games is nothing is perfect and nothing pure **** game and that there are no exceptions. Now, everyone keeps saying its a masterpiece or whatnot and i dont mind it. However, it is not a perfect game like what others keeps saying. It has a lot of bugs and issues that gets overlooked because of its strengths. Regardless though, I could say that it is one the best game i have played in the RPG genre which are in the levels of Dragon Age, Dark Souls/Bloodborne and the old and classic Final Fantasy games.

artificeprime,"Quite possibly the best game of all time. It is exceptionally rare to see style, substance, depth, maturity and sincerity all blended perfectly together. The Witcher 3 excels at this. I have played hundreds of games in my life of all different genres and I honestly can't think of another game that succeeds on so many levels. That's not to say that the Witcher 3 is perfect, it isn't, no game this big is but it does so much and so much well that its pros vastly overshadow its flaws. The sheer scope of the Witcher 3 is an accomplishment that cannot be overlooked. This game is massive and not just long because of countless battles or fetch quests like in many rpgs. The Witcher 3 has some padding but even if you focus on only the essential content this game is extremely large. The world is far bigger than Skyrim and it is full of quests, gear, monsters and lore. This game has enough dialog to rival even large fantasy novels and the quality of the writing is far better than most. There are dozens of memorable characters and they almost all come across as real and authentic. Not just the main characters either, dozens of side quest will introduce you to characters that have more going on than the leads of many other games. Characters like the Bloody Baron are so complex and real. While Yennifer, Triss and Ciri are three of the best female characters in any game. I could talk all day about the characters. The only real weakness I thought was that the primary Antagonist seemed a little bit underdeveloped but by nearly any other game's standards he would still be a pretty good villain. This also isn't a game with just one big bad man causing all the problems, this world is rich with dozens of villains almost all with separate and complex motives. Who is good and who is bad is never black and white. Each character wants something for a reason. The World is the best I have seen in a game. It is not only massive but each region feels unique. Kaer Morhen, Novigrad, Skelliga, Velen, every one of those places is crafted with detail and full of unique landmarks, character moments, quests and stories that give it meaning. It is a world that is both beautiful and horrific. Just traveling through the landscape you will encounter things that you would find in a real world, some are tied to the main plot and some are completely independent. The world has problems outside of the Wild Hunt, war, prejudice, disease, thieves, cults, corrupt politicians etc. The Witcher 3's world puts most of the best rpgs to shame. If there is a game with a better world please point it out so I can go play it. The Witcher 3 manages to pull off dark and gritty while also having many of the funniest and most emotionally sincere moments I have seen in a game. Geralt lives an extremely dark life but the world of the Witcher is believably varied. Geralt has friends that are genuinely funny, he has relationships with multiple women and most of those relationships are better written and more sincere than those in 90% of games that only have one. Geralts relationship with Ciri is a great father daughter story. His relationship with Yennifer is a genuine and complex romance. The same is also true with Triss. Another thing the Witcher does brilliantly is offer meaningful options. So many choices in other games either have very little effect on the main plot or are simplistic good vs bad options. In the Witcher choices are complicated and have a far greater impact. You can choose who to help become king or queen and it actually effects the story in multiple ways. Choosing who Geralt loves can have consequences good and bad. If Geralt tries to romance multiple women it can come back to bite him. Choosing to save a person's life might lead to the terrible death of someone else, even major characters. One of the things that is so impressive about the Witcher 3 is that even if it was a top down game with pixel art it would still be a great game. Fortunately it isn't, it is one of the best looking games of the current gen. Some many moments are works of art. The character models are well thought out and there are countless details, different forms of clothing, and weapons. Monsters also look believable, unlike so many rpgs which pad out their rosters with monsters that look like house hold items. The landscapes are gorgeous and weather effects make it that much better. I could write several more pages on what makes the Witcher 3 great but the bottom line is that it succeeded in completely immersing me in its world for over 100 hours. For nearly 20 years the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time held my top spot for best game of all time. In my opinion the Witcher 3 has surpassed it. I still think that there are many areas that the game could be improved. Combat is good but not great. The menus are cluttered and many of the game play mechanics are far from the best but as a total package, the Witcher 3 is as good as it gets so far.",10,2017-01-01,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The quests are interesting, and the cut scenes are cinematic **** there are TONS of them with great dialogue. The combat excellent, and there's a lot of interesting stuff that you find if you jump off the trail and just explore around Amazing game, it is the best RPG in recent years.

OvercastGamer,"It’s a safe assessment that eighty per cent of the characters in The Witcher 3 do not want you there. They hate you offering your services, and detest you even more when they part with their hard-earned coin. Your mere appearance, it seems, is but to weigh heavy on their soul. With such a depressing outlook, it’s a wonder CD Projekt’s pièce de résistance isn’t one big sad slog, but quite the opposite. The Witcher hosts a vibrant world brimming with opportunity, you need only stagger your way around to see it all. As someone long weary of fetch quests and open-world nonsense, to be as enamored as I am with this game is somewhat of a miracle. Wrapped in mystique, I’m eager to explore every arcane cranny. An ominous hole? Better believe I’m going down there for what could be as little reward as a loaf of bread. Appropriately, ‘wild’ is the word I’d use to best describe the massive world of Temeria. The harsh, windswept landscape feels anything but safe, bringing with it treasure, beasts and happenstance which could see you stashing a new bit of steel, or assertively pirouetting over a cliff. Among its many creatures, hazardous fish-men ‘Drowners’ roam both land and sea, scratching at your heels as you pop down to explore that one last chest, wreck, or – as it turns out – three-storied Temerian Atlantis. It’s a land lived-in and a seamless melding of scene, weather and soundscape that brings forth a magnificent and detailed melancholy, the mood and intimacy of The Last of Us mixed with the beauty and breadth of Red Dead Redemption. A simple stroll shows just how beautiful Temeria must have been before the war. Sweeping hills, plunging valleys and more than one glorious sunset still lighten the landscape, but the earth is now stained with blood from battles not long fought; overturned carriages litter the back roads, and lynched corpses sway quietly in the breeze – a warning – the shoes-on-the-power-line of this world. It’s strange then that a team could build to such heights yet erect the foundations in a bog. Plagued by clunkiness, movement in The Witcher 3 feels like parkour through molasses – weighty and frustrating in equal measure. Never have I been more aware of gravity than prancing the coastline to only seconds later be met with an untimely demise, courtesy of what must’ve been a slippery ledge or perhaps an overly oily pair of boots? Keen to check that chest on the bluff? Get ready to amble tentatively and god help you if you overcompensate in acceleration – you’ll be eating more dirt than a Rock Troll. To afford a humanoid the weight and steering of a dual-skid catamaran is both bold and baffling, and it’s unfortunate that the plethora of boats littering the numerous lakes, seas and Temeria’s main river the Pontar, already pushes The Witcher well over its quota of maritime vessels. Sadly, there’s just no room for the S.S. Geralt. To further **** this sandwich, The Witcher comes with one of the most ruthless fall damage systems I’ve seen. Anything more than a small drop and you’re a crumpled husk. It’s as if CD Projekt Red had a delayed reaction to the Crouching Tiger-like jumping of Bethesda’s Oblivion and set out to create the most grounded RPG imaginable, literally. Fortunately, this kind of weight translates well to combat. Everything from a quick slash to a flashy upward arc feels both powerful and hefty. Enemies come with a reasonable head on their shoulders, and bandits, pirates or any of the numerous creatures will rally, mob and use their numbers to cut you down before you can get your own in. If respected, the combat system can give way to some excitingly grim finishers: an above waist vivisection, a kneeling decapitation or a grand height reduction by way of a sweeping kick… with a sword. Keep a quick dodge at the ready, and you’ll be lopping off legs in no time. For the most part, The Witcher is astonishingly beautiful and without doubt, one of the best looking games on the PS4. So good are the visuals that it feels a disservice to any more than lightly jog the streets of its largest city, Novigrad, for all the things you may miss. Unfortunately, such a detailed palette has it slightly outreach its technical grasp. Load times are lengthy (prepare to pop the jug on should you die) and frames do take a dive in the more detailed and intensive areas such as Crookback Bog. The game also suffers from a team adjusting to mucking about on consoles. The UI is cumbersome, and the inventory: a grid-based system with egregiously small type. It may work on PC, but all that squinting and rummaging can quickly become tiresome without a mouse. But, it’s an easy trade and The Witcher’s achievements far outweigh its missteps. The cast of characters is massive and always interesting. Individuals come pre-packaged with their own fears, loves, motivations and hatreds (you, mainly) and this affords a decent whack of nuance to side quests whilst aiding in the helix questing system – strands of adventures",9,2016-09-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user

At first learning how to move and fight took a little learning but once you get used to it you feel very tactical and patient in fights waiting for the opportune time to get a hit or 2 in. It really makes you take each encounter seriously and cautiously. The story is the best I've seen in a game and it is really easy to get attached to characters. The facial expressions and attention to detail in this game is stellar. The amount of content is mind blowing. The map is huge and there are countless quests each feeling connected to the world. I rarely play through games more than once because I know what going to happen already but I am playing new game plus after my first play through and I haven't lost any motivation or drive to continue.

Glowguy,"After revisiting this game I can definitively say that it is a clear top 5 favorite for me and possibly my favorite game period. The world is incredibly detailed and beautiful to explore - I took so many screenshots that I lost count. The human element is surprisingly realistic and they designers really nailed the savage brutal elements of a medieval society during wartime - It's kind of like being thrown into an interactive episode of Game of Thrones. Along the way you will interact with a rich tapestry of complex characters and your choices will affect the outcome of events in surprising and unexpected ways - I was blown away by this and it makes the game really rewarding. The game play itself has a lot of depth and allows for plenty of customization as a good RPG should. The game features a dazzling array of crafting options for armor and weapons including some treasure hunts for special 'Witcher' gear; a deep alchemy component that allows you to create useful potions, bombs, and special monster decoctions; and a variety of skills and minor spells that you can select and develop as you gain experience. Part of what makes the game so fun is taking on an increasingly menacing variety of monsters to acquire the rare components needed to construct your upgrades. The game even features a highly addictive meta-game within that will have you challenging every NPC you can and trekking all over the world to find rare additions to your collection. My only very minor complaint is that the game is a bit easy especially on the lower difficulty levels. I am currently playing on Death March and mowing down opponents without much trouble (though I did die a lot on my first play through). The Witcher sense tracking aspect of the game could use a little refinement as it felt too linear and solving most quests mainly just involved finding enough glowing red clues until Geralt pieces things together for you. This was the only aspect of the game play that I felt to be a little lacking, but they pretty much knocked everything else out of the ballpark.",10,2016-09-19,PLAYSTATION 4,user

mattlarkin,"Not long ago the second and final DLC for the Witcher 3 was released. In honor of that, I'm doing a long-overdue review of the whole game, including both DLCs. First of all, the DLCs each play as separate campaigns of significant length. The first could be completed just before the end of the main Wild Hunt campaign (but is best done post-game), the second should definitely be post-game. With that out of the way ... I have not played Witcher 1 or 2 (mainly because they were not on Playstation), and I wish I had. Because this game is EPIC. Not only does the main campaign feature an amazing story, each of the two side campaigns have their own unique stories which are maybe even more compelling than the main plot. The Witcher takes place in a pseudo-European, dark fantasy world based on books by the same name. A long time ago this world overlapped with others in an event called the Conjunction of Spheres. A bunch of creatures from those other worlds became trapped in our world. Some of these are elves and such, but most are vampires. To fight these, people created witchers--mutant monster hunters with superhuman abilities. Only later, they decided witchers were kind of like monsters too, and they hated them. Until they need one. The world is deliciously dark--which I love--and draws a lot of inspiration from Slavic mythology. It's not all Slavic myth, though. You have other fantasy/myth staples here and there, like djinn and so forth. It's a massively open world reminiscent of Skyrim. I mean HUGE, with so many places to explore, quests to complete, and monsters to hunt you could basically invest a bazillion hours into the game and not do everything. Gameplay took a little getting used to at first. Once I got the hang of it (hint, dodge monsters, parry humans), though, it ran fairly smoothly. I played it mostly as a swordsman, but you can customize Geralt to focus more on alchemy or signs (magic) and all styles of play are intended to be effective. The DLC introduces further options for customization and even a use for ability points once you have otherwise reached the cap. I played on the medium difficulty, which only occasionally proved challenging. The combat system was rewarding and never grew tedious. What I think I liked even more than that, though, was the plot. Witcher stars Geralt and occasionally his adopted daughter Ciri. It also gives a lot of time and development to numerous NPCs in ways that make your choices seem like they actually matter. In this way, the game is somewhat reminiscent of Dragon Age games, though I found the story more compelling in Witcher. Unlike in the former, I never got bored in dialog with NPCs, never felt compelled to skip ahead. I highly recommend this game. 10 out of 10.",10,2016-09-10,PLAYSTATION 4,user

mwil236,"A truly tremendous game; you already know the deal. Amazing characters, thrilling combat, a huge world, robust crafting, countless items and many surprises. The only perceivable flaws with the game are that the story is so long and complex that it is possible to forget exactly what's going on, mainly because you'll get sidetracked with so many other quests. There are a handful of technical flaws, but given how large and ambitious the game world is it's acceptable to see a few graphical tics. Skill trees aren't as good as they could be; you can only level up your signs which aren't hugely important in the long run anyway and you'll never level up enough times to get to where you want to be with them either. Otherwise, everything from exploring the vast landscapes to playing the damn card game will keep you interested when you aren't do other witcher things. Definitely not perfect based on the complex story and so-long-it-can't-help-but-be-repetitive gameplay but also one of the greatest of all time.",9,2016-08-27,PLAYSTATION 4,user
MarquisDeMizzle,"A rich and surprisingly deep open-world RPG.

kietnam,"I'll start of by saying that this is one of my favourite games of 2016. When this game launched I didn't buy it due to it not seeming interesting to me. This is probably due to not playing any of the other games in the series. Eventually this game went on sale and because of the extremely positive reception I decided to give it a try. I didn't regret buying this game and would've bought it at launch for the full price. I'll start off by explaining the gameplay. This game is easily one of the best RPGs I have ever played, and for me, it's easily better than Skyrim. The voice acting is superb. The animation is amazing. The story is intriguing. The characters have personality. The maps are well designed. The quests all feel different. The game is amazing but as much as I praise the game I do have problems with it. My biggest gripe with the game, which made me not play it after a while, is the loading screens. The loading screens in the game are massive. I was doing a quest in the game which involved hunting down a werewolf, seems easy enough. Well werewolfs happen to be extremely hard enemies to face, but that was not my problem. My problem was that every time I died I ended up going through one of the game's loading screens. Due to me being extremely determined to finish this quest I ended up dying a lot, which in turn, meant more loading screens. There was some annoying narrative at the beginning of the loading screens, which got annoying really quickly. This ended up with me getting sick of this and quitting the game all together. I haven't found the motivation to open the game again and end up playing till the end, but from what I saw of the game, I can confidently say that, if you are a fan of RPGs and games like Skyrim, this game is for you. This game would've been my game of the year if I wasn't such a Soulsborne fanboy. 9/10 too many loading screens 4 me.",9,2016-08-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user
GoodApollo88,"I am not entirely convinced by The Witcher 3. Yes it's big and rixh with story quests but it seems outdated in terms of controls. Riding that damn horse Roach is shoddy, better to go by foot. The combat to be fair has improved since The Witcher 2 and there is not such a big emphasis on rolling around like some idiot. The story is good and choices do have hefty consequences. The game is full of things to do but it is extremely glitchy and the overall mechanics are pretty average and outdated, even on a console it feels like your playing a PC game. If you like big games, you'll like it but I don't think it's as good as it was made out to be.",6,2016-08-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Scandaltown,"I would have honestly given this a 5/10, but since it was so ridiculously over hyped, for so long, that I bought it thinking it would be a solid time sink an entire year after it's release, this review is going to be a brutally honest tear down of this second string game. This game is awful, controls are sloppy, combat is arduous, easily glitch exploited, and uninspiring. Leveling, and thus skill unlocks, are tied to main quests making the game droll and needlessly open world. Every vendor gets an often pointless cut scene. I can carry hundreds of reagents (needlessly) but only alcohol and meditation is necessary to craft after the initial production. Objects have weight, but there seems to be no purpose to it as a constraint at all. The game plays like an old ""choose your own adventure"" book, only with long uninspired, and awkward, walks through areas you are punished for exploring. There is extremely low experience for killing random world monsters (each kill within experience range will net you approximately 0.4% of a level which is worse than individual mob killing in WoW and each kill takes much longer) which removes a good deal of interest from exploring the ""open world."" This is combined with the oppressive finance system which actually punishes you for exploring and killing ""the monster curse that still haunts the countryside."" As an example of the terrible implementation of finance: a sword sells for less than a piece of bread costs, repair costs are imbalanced however you can always sell tons of needless herbs for a gold a piece (if you enjoy running circles around overly populated herbs that have to be in L.O.S. of the third person camera AND in front of your character to collect). Combat is a game of attrition, heavily dependent on holding down parry, rolling, and waiting for stamina cooldowns (could be more entertaining on face roll difficulties but I wouldn't know). There is no real ""out of combat"" engaging as ranged weapons do no damage of any import, enemies are obviously tethered and easily exploited for it, enemies typically attack in packs which throws out the counter mechanic most of the time, dodge is inferior to roll against packs and equally as useless as counter. There is no functionally new, clever combat in the game, but there is tons of rehashed combat concepts from other games that have been horribly reused here. The game is overly controlled to give purpose to poor implementation: missing reagents for recipes to prompt you forward, poor experience for not following the story, a poor economy to constrain your trade and attempt to limit your roaming due to the high cost/low reward of killing monsters despite easy (boring) exploits to circumnavigate it. The graphics aren't great for ps4, the game repeatedly failed to maintain a proper render before patching: either slowly degrading textures, or failing to display loot images, or parts of the HUD, and once dumping half of the polygons for the world littering black boxes in straight lines. Even after its 20+gig patch monsters often glitch below ground and pop back up, climbing over barriers rarely looks correct other than hopping fences, and additionally the text is unreasonably small and useless on my 40"" tv 9 ft from my face.... The story is choppy and terse due to the interactive implementation, not to mention forced and puerile. I'd honestly skip it if there was any other redeeming quality to the game, but there isn't. I could go on. There is no way I would have released this game as is, and there is little or no chance I would consider buying another title from this producer. I should have researched it more online, but after a year I was foolishly confident it was a solid bet given its high price point and visibility. I haven't been this disappointed since Dragon's Dogma, and I think it was even worse this go around.",0,2016-08-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user

SaladCake,"Great game with a wonderful story line, well written characters and excellent soundtrack. It has a huge open world filled with a lot of immersive secondary quests, which are equal in quality if not better than the main ones. This is probably the best part of the game, because you can easily lose yourself in this amazingly designed witcher world. Dialogues are interesting and meaningful, the ending of the story will be shaped by your choices .The visuals are great too, one of the best so far. When playing on lower difficulties, the combat is average at best and alchemy system becomes pointless. However, it's not a problem if you play on higher difficulties, especially ""Death March"". It becomes much more interesting and challenging, potions actually starts to matter. Game controls are comfortable, except when riding a horse. It can be very annoying in small villages, you often get stuck or bump into something. You can't avoid bugs, just like in most RPG's. I personally encountered 2 game breaking bugs, which forced me to load the game, but it's not a big deal considering how much attention to detail was paid during the development of the game. I also have to give a lot of credit to CD Project for making this game playable on PS4. On early patches the frame-rate was terrible, I felt like I played on average ~24 fps, but now I hardly notice a dip below 30. Truly a remarkable job, something that can't be said about some other AAA developers.",9,2016-08-11,PLAYSTATION 4,user

If you haven´t play previous witcher games i recommend at least watch on Youtube, some story summary from witcher 1 and 2. You will find videos that explain main story in 5 min. You can also find videos that were made like a movie so you get familiar with the characters. The game had some technical flaws at the begining,on consoles, frame rate, and graphical issues. Now the game is perfect to play, and all expansions are already released.

Most voice acting was done exceptionally well, and the animation and graphics are top notch. Yet, when I put in a game from a couple of years ago, Naughty Dog's The Last of Us, I realized that The Witcher 3's graphics were mundane.

SpunkyMonkey,"Not as good as TW2, and over-rated in general. It's got a lot going for it, the aesthetics are superb, but it's ultimately a dull & draining experience. Firstly, it's now more like Assasin's Creed than TW2 - the villages & towns are all condensed into a mathmatical setup of Store, Noticeboard, Inn, quest - which kills the roleplaying feel a LOT. The general movement and control of Geralt is AWFUL, and you spend probably most of your time running around banging into people. The Open World aspect adds nothing to the game at all, it just means more ball-ache getting from one objective to the next, and everything you can find is usually already revealed by a marker. And the story - whilst OK - isn't anywhere near as gripping, deep or surprising as TW2. The Wild Hunt are barely for the first 20-30 hours. It's a real slog in all honesty, and the great bits which are in there are spread too thin over a mountain full worth of dull filler & fluff. Not a bad game, but a real backwards step from TW2 in my opinion.",0,2016-06-30,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Gwent was something I didn't want to try at first, until I played the scholar at the inn, and oh my god I haven't been able to stop playing gwent till now, it's unique than the other card games you get nowadays, and collecting cards within an RPG game is more fun than I expected, can't wait for the standalone.

BaronMonaco,"CD Projekt and The Witcher have been rising stars in the industry since the first game , this third episode is suppose to be the last of this franchise so will Geralt go out in a bang ? Of course he will (like you probably read it a thousand times before) everything in the game is at least very good, beginning by its technical attributes, the games looks pretty for a RPG this big with nice light effects, large amounts of details and good textures in general, some visual glitches that are almost mandatory for games with that much content are the only bad side of the game, but they will not bother your gameplay experience, the framerate is steady and I didn't encounter any major issue during my 140 hours spend on this game. Gameplay wise the game offers a lot of thing, good investigations//hunts, exploration, grasping fights that are challenging when they need to be with, like the previous games of the franchise there is a great alchemy system that adds a tactical side to the fighting (probably the best fighting I've seen in any A-RPG), the best mini game of the world aka Gwent that is becoming a stand alone on its own now, etc. They implemented a lot of ideas in the game and all of them work great for the global experience of the game, it just feels natural without being assisted. Kudos to CD Projekt they clearly are talented. Finally concerning the story, once again it's a masterpiece they succeed to make an epic main quest, a lot of detailed side quests, some are equally epic, some are funny, some are heartbreaking, etc. All together they make for 100 hours of gameplay for the basic game, but I would truly recommend every one to take both extensions as well they have the same qualities with new awesome characters, monsters, locations, and of course plots and once again you'll get plenty of content, around 40 hours (which could be a full game, even two from other studios), for less than 30€/$. But the biggest accomplishment in the writing of this game is that the story works great whether or not you've played the two previous game, whether or not you've read the books (of course you'll catch up tons of reference if you already know the whole story of The Witcher) you'll be hooked to it and be willing to advance in the game and learn more. In conclusion The Witcher 3 is a must have for every gamer, sure it's not the best looking game ever, but it doesn't matter, it looks good enough and the gameplay works perfectly, it's incredibly full of content and the story is quite possibly the best I've experienced in a video game, at least in recent years, and will leave you some forever lasting memories.

Velgar,"Absolutely amazing game! I have played thousands of different titles in my life, countless RPGs and other story driven games, but the Wither 3 is by far the best of them all. Simply stunning. Hands down my favourite RPG game. Visuals and audio are top notch, you just can't get enough of watching game's picturesque landscapes, cities, villages, caves and forests. You often just slow down and listen to people chatting, nature humming and music casting its spell. Combat is fast paced, tactical, challenging and satisfying, yet it could be even more challenging for my personal preference (like in Dark Souls 3) because even on the hardest possible difficulty I fare quite well and don't die all that often. This is one of those gems that doesn't let you quit playing like the best book or your favourite TV series. If you haven't played this one you have to buy if with all the expansions and let it take you on a breathtaking journey to Sapkowski's amazing world. The best adventure of your life guaranteed.

FogCityRoller,"Even with some of the minor issues in the game, there is no possible way it can get less than 10/10. The characters are well-written, the story is amazing with considerable depth, the difficulty can be excruciating at higher settings (and there's 4 difficulty settings, how often do you see that?), the exploration is endless, the interface and opportunities for character optimization are top notch, and the graphics...well, you don't need a review to tell you how incredible the graphics are. This isn't just GOTY, this is Game of the Last 15 Years. The only RPGs you can't rightfully place this above are classics like Planescape, Fallout 2, and Baldur's Gate. The people complaining about the combat system are probably used to simpler combat mechanics and crutches like auto-adjust cameras and action bars. This isn't 2005 anymore kiddies, time to improve your dexterity. The minor issues that can be annoying are the loading times (which seem short compared to games like Bloodborne but still noticeably long, especially if you're playing on Death March difficulty and die frequently), there's some pathing issues with the auto-run feature while riding Roach, the quest paths can bug out on the map overlay, and being a horse Roach should not have the hurdling issues that he does with some basic obstacles like rocks and felled trees.

Slynessity,"I signed up to Metacritic to give this game its dues. It's a masterpiece ****. CD Projekt Red really put everything they had into this game. From fan interaction, free DLC to post game patches and improvements. They have become my favorite developer, hands down. If you are a fan of Western RPGs, you NEED to play this game! I really enjoyed The Witcher 2. Tho I mostly enjoyed it for its characters and its story. The gameplay was still pretty rough (still a HUGE improvement from The Witcher) and many mechanics were rough too. The Witcher 3 refines everything you know and love about this franchise. The story and characters in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt are amazing. A side quest-line can be deeper and more meaningful than the main story of many other AAA titles out there. The ways characters interact with you and other NPCs is great and you really feel immersed in the world of The Witcher. The voiceovers are also really good and give life to these characters. The World is huge in this game and the locals so diverse. From swamps, to mountains, to grassy fields, to big cities, everything in The Witcher is fun to explore. The game is breathtakingly beautiful. Gameplay has been upgraded tremendously from the previous games and is a joy to play. Fighting and signs mechanics were improved and much easier to use. At the time I write this review, the menus have been re-hauled making everything much better from a UI standpoint. The only negative point I can give the game is the horse mechanics. Horse controls can be very frustrating at times. I've ended up just jumping off the horse and running quite a few times. Yet, that is not enough for me to give this game less than a 10. I'm also not counting the paid DLC in this review (tho I have played both and highly recommend them). This is my Game of the Decade! Please, go get it and play it!

Niglett,"I have a ton of problems with this game, first of its just not fun to play. You spend the entire game chasing after some chick who ultimately is more interesting then the main character and makes me wish i could play as her thru the whole game instead. the combat is garbage with two different ""dodges"" one thats makes you jump too far leaving you to have to roll again to get back to being able to hit them and some kind of side step thing that is way to short and useless to the point were you might as well just roll like a ****. you are also suppose to change between light and heavy attacks, both of them make the main character look like a ballerina in armor swinging around and spinning all over the place. So after two hours when Gerald is done spinning around to get his sword to connect to an enemy, the enemies are just fancy looking sponges who takes way to much damage. So spamming the heavy attack is just as good as anything else. the map is way to big for its own good, with next to nothing to do and uninspired and boring enemy models. you are suppose to use your horse to get around the map, and you can put the horse on autopilot but the autopilot works just as well as letting jesus take the wheel when driving up a mountain. The horse tries its damnest to stick to the roade but keep crashing into things and making you stop, go backwards and try to continue on the roade. I really tried to care about the characters, and get into the world with the quests but the quests usually as exciting as watching paint dry. I completely gave up at the akward werewolf mission were the poor voice actor had to snarl and grunt as if he had too much mucus in his throat. At that point i gave up and turned off the game. at the end of it all i sold the game and deleted it from the ps4.

As a reader of the books upon which this game is based I can attest to the fact that the developers managed to translate the original vision of the author Andrej Sapkowski into this medium perfectly. If you are even remotely interested in the fantasy genre then you owe it to yourself to play this game. Just stop reading this review and go buy it RIGHT NOW.,10,2016-06-07,PLAYSTATION 4,user

tbouniverse,"An all time classic right here. The characters are so well written that they are real to me. Main characters Geralt, Yennefer and Ciri are so complex and their chemistry together is so touching. I just finished playing Blood and Wine and have truly seen the end to Geralt's journey, which is very bitter yet sweet at the same time. My only worry now is whether or not I'll be able to enjoy another action/ adventure as I played the best of the best. Must buy. Thank me later.",10,2016-06-03,PLAYSTATION 4,user
benjaminbretz,"So I mean, hey, Witcher 3 is good. You know this. It was named Game Of The Year by like, what. IGN, right? And Gamestop maybe, I dunno. Hey you've been in a Gamestop before, right? Is it just me or do they all smell like a couch? Not like a new couch, but a couch that's in your friend's friend's basement. And it has a stain on it and they say ""oh that's from salsa"" but dude, that's not a salsa stain. Seriously, Gamestop, if you ever read this, do some sort of trade-out cross-promotion with Febreze in your stores. So uh, Witcher 3. Good game. And, look, I'm going to judge the game based on what I am: a middle-aged guy with other things to do. Like, lots of other things, like a job and my second degree that I'm working on and a lawn and yelling at neighbor kids who ride their bikes on my lawn and stuff. Yeah, I don't care if it's just a corner of my lawn, Christ. Ride out in the goddamn street. Where were you kids born, Jerusalem? Anyway. So here's what I like about Witcher 3: Graphics are stunning. Some of the most enjoyable moments are standing in the wilderness, slowly panning the camera around Geralt, looking at the scenery. Wind blowing through his majestic hair. Under your breath, mumbling, ""nerr nerr nerr NERRRR nerr nerrr nerr NAAH NERR NUUHNNN."" That's the intro to Creed's ""My Sacrifice"" by the way. Maybe you weren't actually doing this but I was. Not because I thought it was a good song but, you know, stuff gets caught in your head sometimes. Look, shut up. And uh. Actually the graphics were the only thing I REALLY liked about this game. Yeah hey, look, no, I know. The story is really in-depth, the map is MASSIVE. Attention to detail, 10/10. But this is a game for people who can plunge into the experience and stay there for hours and hours or days on end. This isn't a criticism of the game, but if you're reading this and you're a 40-ish dude (but I'm sure you could totally pull of early 30s, really) with a bunch of other obligations, you need to know you're not going to appreciate this the same way ol' Weedy Joe in Colorado can during his 48 hour Doritos-Sponsored WitcherBingers. No, instead I found myself loading it up after a long workday, after my workout routine, after doing homework, and then spending the first half-hour trying to remind myself what armor and swords were on my to-do list to upgrade, and then figuring out which main quest or side quest I wanted to pursue. Right about that time it suddenly occurred to me it was about time to go the hell to bed because I had to wake up at 5am for work because somewhere in the past decade or so, against my realistic wishes, I became a goddamn adult. Look, it happens. You don't mean it to. You want to pretend you'll always be the version of yourself that can load a bowl with one hand and build a TF2 sentry with the other with seamless beauty. But you won't, man. You just won't. So for most of you, hit it. Enjoy. Sally-effing-forth. But for me, this game was too big, too much. Dare I say: Too Good. I'll still give it an 8 though. Also, why does everything that Geralt yells at his horse sound like softcore porn? SUH-LOOWWW NOW. UHHHHH. FASTER!! THESE FEELINGS DEEP DOWN, THEY A-SCARE-A ME, SWEET THANG. It's weird. It's just weird, I tell you.",8,2016-06-03,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Bilbo101,"Personally I have played a huge arrange of games and I can confidently say The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt is the best game I have ever played. This game has countless hours of immersive and addictive fun, each of the 3 different worlds (not including the huge world from the Blood and Wine DLC) has its own different atmosphere for instance Skellige is the harsh conditioned viking land with large vast snow covered mountains. Novigrad is the city which offers humorous quests and easy contracts to earn money from, then there's Velen which is infested with monsters and bandits. The most populated areas are small villages and is mostly just woods. All of them are included in the long main story. I strongly recommend this game to anyone who likes free roaming games and RPG's.",10,2016-06-02,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Huizi,"Graphically, the game is beautiful, mechanically it leaves ALOT to be desired. The fighting is slow and sluggish, the controls respond a 1-3 seconds after the input, controlling your horse, Roach, is even more difficult and won't go where you tell him a good portion of the time. The sound is great but broken up by ambient sounds occasionally that are louder than what's actually going on. also, when fighting enemies I've had several glitches(?) where a move that goes in a straight line makes a 90 degree turn to hit me, or I'll take damage from enemy attacks when they aren't performing said attacks. All in all its a very beautiful game and rich world I could get lost in until some glitch, flawed mechanic, or poor design choice pulls me right back out. Pretty average for a AAA title, but pretty good for a small studio without a lot of talent.",5,2016-05-28,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Filaton,"A magnificent game, with a lush fantasy world brimming with so much content that it puts quite a few other titles to shame. The game is easily over 150 hours if you want to do all the quests and locations on the map. The battle system is a polished version of Witcher 2's system, with a more intuitive skill system. The only thing I'd nitpick about are the menus, browsing a full inventory tends to get a little overwhelming for me.

JoshBtB,"My oh my. The negative reviews have their points: some slightly clunky mechanics at times. That being, you might find yourself wondering in to a wall here and there, struggle to have the smoothest of horse rides from time to time - the horse riding is the most clunky... you can jump 'roach' over obstacles but there's times when your going full gallop an a little broken brick wall might be somewhat in your way and where you might hope 'Roach' has the initiative to leap over the little wall instead you come to an abrupt hault before you've seen it... you have to be a horse jump master, basically. But it's hardly a worry because they've ingeniously input a mechanic where if one is riding along a path, if you let go of the analogue controls, you can ride said path without steering, just canter, gallop and glue - makes for nice scenery watching as you ride, though be sure to steer when you get to a cross-road or hair pin or you'll soon be riding in the wrong direction. But other than a minor bit of clunk here and there (trying to angle your screen just right to select one of several bags that you haven't looted yet) this is an otherwise fluid and tasty little game. Anyone **** about loss of combat mechanics is talking rubbish - okay there's not the pedantic math of the huge MMO RPGs but if I'm honest that to me is a bonus; no game should be bestable based on one's ability to sum up the digits... it should be bestable on one's unique talents - I get so down when the only way to be king of the crop is to ""HAVE THIS INCREDIBLY SPECIFIC LOADOUT AND SKILLSET AND ARMOUR"" - The Witcher delivers this but otherwise relies on a player's collection of potions and bombs, the diagrams they've found and all manner of skill combinations - when it comes down to it, if you can't kill the monster up ahead, it's because you haven't read your beastiary like a real Witcher, you haven't found the right tools for the specific job and you just aint got the stones to take the creature down. No one collection of items does it all - this: me likey very much! Graphically of course it's stunning - overly orange dazzling sunrises over forested peaks and where folks and saying: same old westernised fantasy realm (unoriginal) I beg to differ! The USA is typical for it's glossy caricature of fantasy, Project Red delivers, instead, a far more (in spite of a nice hue at sundown) wind-beaten landscape, craggy, haunting. I've wondered enough fantasy game forests without so much as a whisper of fear only to find myself feeling slightly spooked when first caught in the middle of the mist-veiled trees of Velen. The monsters don't feel like alien lifeforms either, they look like monsters that could very well exist in our human world - pit me against a any of the beasts of ESO or Warcraft any day over the horrible flesh-sloughing, skeletal and fang-ridden horrors of the world of the Witcher. Even the bears have a lumbering, hulking majesty over the roly poly figures I've seen across all manner of other available digital landscapes. There are plenty of fantasy cliches but where I've seen other realms fail to capture the sincerity of their story vs. the humour in their in jokes, the Witcher just seems to breeze both, every cliche is obviously and intentionally hilarious whilst the genuine nature of its more serious undertones feel far more alive, more pressing and genuinely harrowing. I thought I'd hate Geralt's typical American hero, husky, sarcastic and blunt demeanour: instead I genuinely LOVE it - it's relentlessly funny because it's so awfully jarring - some smooth, stereotypical badass trying to reason with confused Welsh peasants; really funny. And there's another win, in spite of the American cast of heroes, everyone else is deliciously Euro/UK regional in accent, the Mancunians, the Yorkshireman, the Glaswegians, the ****, the Spaniards and the Poles... all done with enough racial stereotype but genuinely accurate dialect and mannerisms to make this game feel so much more real and alive than the static; ""Hey! You there, please help me with this quest! My sheep are lost and I have a reward for anyone who can find them"" NPCs of too many fantasy gaming realms. Sore that you can't kill any old random NPC? Well then you're missing the most integral part of the Witcher universe: several novels and short stories combined emanating from as early on as the 1980s, 2 other games of rich (apparently non-canon but so well-done that many consider them to be) history and storyline and characters not of your own design - they have their own morals or lack of and for me, immersing myself in that story and character mindset appeals to my inner love for fantasy and story over my desire to just run around like a headless Trevor Phillips murdering everything in my path: not that kind of game at all.

The story is so engaging and it just hooks you in and you want to continue playing to see what happens, the story is absolutely amazing. And, there is so, so much content to do after you finish the campaign. The witcher contracts, which are like side missions, are so amazing. Definitely, easily my favorite side missions of any game ever. There are many witcher contracts and many side missions, and you are nowhere near done after finishing the campaign. The characters in this game are spectacular as well. This game is one of the best experiences you can buy on next gen consoles. One of the best RPG's, and best games ever.

Rocketman64,"This game has had a lot of love and care put into it and you can feel that as soon as you start playing. The biggest problem is how disjointed it is. The controls for experiencing the story are completely separate from those that are used in combat, and those used to solve puzzles and explore. The game isn't really an experience as much as it several little bits of game play aspects. Side stories are great and you really affect the world which is near unprecedented in a game, but a lot of the stuff that is in the game is tedious and not fun. Once you have finished a Witcher contract or investigation you have really done the all because they are always the same. The game's combat is also boring. I got used to it on the hardest difficulty, because that is how I like to play action RPG's, but it just became a tedious slog of the same **** The only reason to play this game is for the beauty of the world and writing, which are so great, they outweigh my qualms with the game. This game had so much love and heart put into it is amazing and worth buying just for that reason alone. Ultimately it is let done by it's game play which is repetitive as **** and honestly I wish I could skip just to experience the world which is so great. And I am someone who loves the **** out of game play, I love Mario because it is raw game play and Dark Souls because it lets you learn and master its mechanics, but the Witcher never introduces new challenges in game play, it just has the same encounters dressed in different ways.",7,2016-05-13,PLAYSTATION 4,user

MerodeTalks,"I'm a fan of The Witcher saga. I've read books several times and played earlier games. This doesn't matter really, because this game is going to be just as enjoyable to somebody who knows nothing about The Witcher yet. This game is a good mixture of story-telling and gameplay mechanics. Exploration is also a big thing in this game and there's a lot of area to cover. This game is certainly not a substitute for Skyrim or Fallout which have very little story (which is not the most important aspect of these games). This game has a very good non-linear story which is even better if you know the franchise. The map is huge. I have invested over 130 hours and I can't say that I've been everywhere yet. There's a ton of stuff to do (outside quests) - hidden treasures, bandit camps and so on. The quests are very well written and most of them have better story than some other games. What is the most important - none of the quests felt like a chore and they aren't repetitive. Visuals are very good and as of now (patch 1.12) game runs most of the time at 30FPS with seldom dips to 25FPS. Unfortunately that wasn't the case in the past. Until patch 1.10 the bog was vary badly optimized and during night FPS dropped to constant 18-20FPS (which is FIXED NOW). Soundtrack and sounds are very good. The music has a Slavic vibe to it (well, the whole game does) and I really like it. Not only because I'm from Slavic country, but mostly because there are no other games like it. Combat is much improved compared to The Witcher 2. The game forces you to utilize all your tools in most of the fights on normal (suggested) difficulty. These tools are - potions, signs (magic) and bombs. On harder difficulties it's nearly impossible to do anything without using all of these. If I had to name the worst part of the game, it's the interface and inventory in particular. It's a SLOW mess. After you spend some time with the game and inventory fills up, opening its interface takes good 2 seconds. Switching between inventory categories takes these 2 seconds as well. If you have to get to 4th tab in inventory, you do the math. Another part I didn't like is the map. It's slow and often loads up regions as you scroll (you first see black background). I don't like the fact that map pauses at markers because in this game the map is FULL OF markers and it pauses all the time. Another issue are bugs. Most of the annoying ones are fixed now but it wasn't that way from the beginning . The good thing is that developer cares and patches were being released in a quick and professional manner. As a huge The Witcher franchise fan, I'm really happy for this game. I treasure it because I know we won't get anything like it for a long time now. If it wasn't for the interface, inventory and map I'd give it 10/10 because I believe that this game is truly unique. As it is, I'll give it a strong 9/10. PS.: The new expansion (Blood and Wine) will introduce interface redesign and I hope that inventory and map will become FAST.",9,2016-05-12,PLAYSTATION 4,user

It feels like you're living inside of a living, breathing Tolkien novel. Usually I say gameplay is king. And, for the most part it is. And while I would prefer a lightly less ""spammy"" and janky experience during combat, it is far from being bad. It's just a part of the game that's weaker than the rest; and considering that the rest is so amazing, my recommendation does not falter. Go out there and buy it.

chillaxer,"If you like action RPGs at all, this is just about the best game you could hope for. Great story, graphics, music, characters, blood and gore, violence, profanity, gratuitous nudity, sex, humor, the whole 9 yards. There are however, some minor deficiencies to note. First, the game is LOADED with boring sub-plots and cut scenes. It’s okay though because you can skim the subtitles and skip through the cut scenes fairly easily without much risk of missing critical information. So I guess that gives players the flexibility to pay as much or as little attention to the plots as they want. Second, the world seems to be divided into several areas for purposes of loading into RAM. But often you have to jump back and forth between these areas, and it gets annoying repeatedly having to view the same comic-book-like cut screen and monologue while an area loads. Finally, most of the skills are worthless relative to other skills. If you experiment with all the skills, it becomes pretty obvious what the “best” skills are to improve. So, if you re-allocate your points (which is possible using a potion) to the best skills, you become virtually invincible. At that point, you’re just playing through the story without any realistic challenge. Overall 10/10. Just get it.",10,2016-04-30,PLAYSTATION 4,user

There are have been some cool moments, like the slaying of the griffin in the beginning, and the flying creatures in general get me pumping a little, but by and large I find myself grinding through the game feeling rather disinterested. The world feels empty and meaningless as I pick up hundreds of items I can barely read on the screen. The story bores me and I just don't care. The Last of Us made me care. GTA 5 made me care. And those were PS3 titles! Why the Witcher 3 is the third highest rated game on Metacritic I don't understand. Perhaps someone could explain this to me? Honestly though PS4 games have been a bit of a let down to date. Here's hoping for better, more soulful releases in the near future. Thanks.",6,2016-04-27,PLAYSTATION 4,user

KekL0rd,"Probably the best RPG I've played in a while, with such an immersive story and breath-taking graphics. Many monsters to fight, quests to do and NPC's you can help. Many dialogue options that can be interesting and create different choices and endings. Combat is somewhat fluid, and you can choose between signs (spells), a cross bow, bombs, and your swords, plus some potions and elixirs. You can improve combat by leveling up and adding to skills. But the story is great, and the towns and forests of the Continent are worth sight-seeing if you can handle it. You must also know that this game feels more like a story than an RPG. I had no problem with that, but if you have a small attention span then you might not like this game. Otherwise, it's a must-have game for die hard role-playing fans.",10,2016-04-18,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Playing 100+ hours of this game and still having plenty to do is a true accomplishment. Witcher 3 does a great job of making you feel like you belong in this huge open world doing the quests required with a outstanding story. A game such as Witcher 3 deserves the rating of 'masterpiece' and no less. The game can have some bugs and glitches a long the way but nothing major as it's truly a huge, action packed, beautiful and engaging game Pros - great story - smooth combat - more than enough to do - beautiful open world Cons - can be glitchy - long loading screens",10,2016-03-30,PLAYSTATION 4,user
alexmann,"A masterpiece by any standard. This game combines the best parts of any open world RPG to create a stunning, large, and breathtaking journey. Characters are deep and their motivations are realistic. In addition the world is perfect. It feels real and lived in- more so than any other open world I have seen. The main thing that sets it apart is your role within that world. In games like Skyrim or Dragon age you ARE the world. The many factions of the world of Skyrim/DA revolve around you and your decisions. This is not the case in the witcher. Rather than being the focus of the world you are but a mere piece of the puzzle. You have an effect on the world, but a realistic effect at that. You control nothing, you simply play your part and that is amazing.",10,2016-03-28,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Dawso,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt marks a magnificant development point in open world rpg games. While the main quest has a deep if not memorable story line it is the presentation of side quests that truly astounds. Each side quests has its own story, choices and cast of memorable characters, fetch quests for the most part these aint. Now onto gameplay, there is a deep crafting system in place for both weapons and armour with blue prints available throughout the world wether you stumble upon them exploring the world or are rewarded them upon quest completion. Whilst the combat lacks the depth of some rpgs it is still enjoyable, particularly fights against powerful beasts which demand that the player use appropriate strategies, spells and tonics to win the battle. The world of this rpg is well populated with npcs, animals and monsters and feels truly alive particularly as it changes because of the decisions you made. It short you are a witcher, a type of misfit, distrusted hero on a quest to find a missing girl, where you will draw on your skills as a swordsman and your knowledge of spells which all witchers know. This game is a must for any open world rpg fan.",9,2016-03-27,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Nnabeal14,"I usually don't feel the need to review games, but his one deserves it. When I got my first RPG game (Skyrim), my reaction was ""Woah, no game is EVER gonna top this!"" Boy was i frikin wrong. The Witcher 3 managed ti surpass every expectation I ever had. The graphics are amazing, the story is amazing, the sidequests feel like a whole other game entirely. Just get this game! Now, the only reason I have waited on buying this game for so long was that I thought I could not understand the story, and I was wrong again! The story is wonderfully explained and pulls you in (and you have the sudden desire to become a witcher and even start trying out the Signs [or spells] in private to see if they can work!) The only reason I gave it a 9 and not a 10 was because I am not a big fan of the weapon degradation system, and I feel that adding the option to disable it would be brilliant.

illphil,"I know that most people were throwing out 10s for this (critics included) but i don't think it was anything special. i completed it and sold it. going through the story and a few side quests here and there, i did enjoy it. its got a lot of content to be fair and the graphics are really good. gwent is also good fun to get into. it was just the gameplay i thought that wasn't up to par. i played it straight after bloodborne and for me the combat seemed clunky and repetitive. the sword parrying and fighting isnt very smooth and for a lot of enemies all u really do is go at them swinging until they die, with a bit of dodging and the occasional bit of magic thrown in. its all just a numbers games, if ur too low level u have no chance of killing them and if ur a couple more then theyre a piece of cake. and as u ride around theres such a mixture of levels in the enemies that u seldom match up. the quests are sometimes interesting story-wise but many of them are a case of 'go here, kill this and come back'. u ride around and find badass enemies but at no point did i really feel like i wanted to go back when i was level 34 to batter them and maybe get a reward for doing so. i spent ages going round for the good armor upgrades and weapons but there wasnt really any great pay-off at the end. its still worth a buy if u havent already, and especially if u get it cheap. but to be honest don't expect miracles- its good to see the story through. but i really think the hype is way overdone for this one.",7,2016-03-27,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The story provided by a side-quest puts a game like Destiny to shame, as every part of this game has a meaning and a purpose. Though the camera system and controls can sometimes be unresponsive and make for some hilarious glitches, once you enter this world (that is 4x bigger than Skyrim) you will not be able to put your controller down once you begin that quest to find Ciri, meeting memorable and loveable characters along the way.

jsoileau14,One of my favorite video games of all time. Geralt’s adventure was a BLAST. I never played the first two so i really did not know how it was going to be. I loved every second of it..getting lost is the best part this map is twice the size of GTA V and that is saying something. I would find myself exploring hours upon hours and always finding something new like Loot or cave or sunken ship. The game is So deep in its RPG mechanics and customization. Story is spectacular and keeps you going which is hard to do in a game of this size with all the side quests and what not. Game is absolutely GORGEOUS. the Graphics are over the top and the controls are super slick. If you liked RDR and dragon age and skyrim. MEET The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.

This game moved to the big screen with the right effort would kill at the box office. Great story that moves the game nicely and keeps you the player gripped with the big idea. Yes you get massive amounts of game play outside the story but these endeavors have enough mojo to keep you death gripping the controller.

HapaxHog,"This game is incredibly intriguing, looks amazing, has terrific design of both visuals and the mechanics of the game itself as well as some of the most compelling story writing you'll ever see (every quest, EVERY, has it's own unique narrative. There are no lazy ambient quests). The issue, however, with this game is twofold: size/scale and pacing. If you are someone who enjoys being constantly stimulated and moving from one destructive engagement to the next, TW3 is not for you. Likewise, if travelling over large distances does not sound appealing to you, TW3 may not be your game. This is because The Witcher 3 is both an incredibly huge game, and an incredibly well paced game. I say well-paced here because in terms of game design the pacing in this piece of media is just phenomenal. Playing for the first time generally everything happens at the right time in terms of preparedness and intrigue, and due to the expansive setting you will never be rushed. However this slow and methodical approach which permeates almost every part of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt may leave some people feeling bored, as the immediate objective is yours to decide, getting into action is not always a button click away, and the game is by and large entirely driven by the compelling narrative and excellent acting. If you want something easy to consume and have fun with, avoid The Witcher 3. If you want the equivalent **** book (or series of books) in the form of interactive entertainment, then The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is the game you've probably been waiting for if you haven't played it already.",10,2016-03-18,PLAYSTATION 4,user

ctn1187,"Where do I being? The world and the atmosphere is one of the most impressive landscapes I've ever experienced in my 24 years of playing video games. Everything is interactive, and it all looks so beautiful. The storyline is simple, yet it definitely gets your attention. I geniually care about Geralt and Ciri and most of the other supporting characters. I thought Tess and Zoltan were both great. The controls take a while to get a hold of but that's a good thing. I don't want to just smash the x-button the entire time I play a game. The witcher, and the many different villains that you fight require you to constantly change up your strategy in combat. I like that. Makes it interesting. Keeps it from getting stale. i love the different types of quests in the game. Some of the Witcher contracts have a nice sense of horror to them. Then there are some (the threesome quest) that have some funny moments to them. Gwent is one of the best in-game games I've ever experienced. You can literally just play that game for hundreds of hours. If you are a gamer, I would definitely suggest to play this on the hardest level. I played on normal and it was too easy so i went back and put the difficulty alll of the way up, and it was a much more challenging experience but made me feel much more satisfied. lastly, without giving too much away, Ciri is one of my favorite characters of all-time. Like Ellie from the Last of Us, I truly started to get emotionally attached to Ciri. I wanted her to be happy and I'm glad that I got the Witcher ending. I would have felt really empty had I thought Ciri died. I would be willing to play the entire game as Ciri btw, who is very fun to use in combat. This was the best game of the year.

BigMatchu,"I have had this masterpiece since its release but It is only now that I have decided to write a review. First of all I wanna say that I get bored of games easily. I usually play them for a few weeks and then trade them for another game or for cash. However The witcher is the only game so far that I will never ever get rid of. I actually have not completed the game. I stopped playing it on purpose because I decided that I would wait until the final dlc and until I had read all the books. Yes!!! I love this game so much that I have been reading the books to familiarise myself with the lore a lot better. I had never played the first game and I never got into the second one, but the wild hunt hooked into me deeply. It is not a game. It's another world, alive and full of thoughts and emotions that just **** you in. It has raised the standards for rpg games so high that I don't think it will ever be matched. This game was made with pure love from cdprojeckt which I think is the secret of its success. If you haven't bought it yet, then slap yourself for being a fool and buy your copy now.",10,2016-03-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user
JoyStikEnt,"Editor’s Opinions: The Witcher 3 was one of the most anticipated games of the year and it delivered well past expectations. After putting well over 60 hours into the game, I felt as if I had barely put a dent in it, and that is okay in anybody’s book when a game cost $60 a pop. Sound: Music in The Witcher 3 gets a bit repetitive but not to the point that it is annoying by any means. Interactions with other characters feel right, as the voice acting is perfect and believable. Combat sounds incredible as you deal or take damage. Graphics: The Witcher series has been beautiful since the first game released and 3 was no different. The open world looked and felt massive, but every piece of the game looked so detailed. Characters were laggy at times, but this did not take away from how pretty this game looked overall. Gameplay: The Witcher 3 is known for great combat, and great combat is what it gave players. No matter if it was an easy 3 hit kill, or a long drawn out battle during a hunt, it played perfect. Looting new gear and weapons keeps you busy and like all open world games, inventory is a pain to sort through. All over gameplay for The Witcher 3 will keep players happy throughout the entire game and more. Replay Value: Moderately High Story: The Witcher 3 tells an engaging story, full of emotions and attachments to characters. With hours and hours of side quest plus a relatively long story, The Witcher 3 prevails with story telling.",9,2016-03-11,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The button configuration is personally unfavorable, but that's my opinion. I think 7 out of 10 is a generous score. I'm not sure how it won game of the year for 2015... maybe it was the length of the game that earned it the title. Like I said, great game, but certainly not the funnest I've played for PS4. I would have loved if it had a first-person mode to give it a Skyrim-like feel, then again, I would love it if all games had optional 3rd person and first person views...

When I finished the game I was a bit sad even if the out come was what I wanted. The story was that good. (my opinion) Geralt (who you will be playing as 98% of the time) to some can feel un-human and un-relatable. (I don't have that problem) But thats the thing he's a lone wolf, warrior, and outcast.

I believe I'm still in the beginning stages of this game even though I put maybe 30+ hours into it already doing side missions until I'm satisfied then take on 1-2 main missions. Let's just say I wished that there was more time during the day to play the game. This is what I call a great RPG: story, action, character building. The reason I rated it a 9 is because I have minor issues with the combat mechanics and it is difficult to quickly earn money, but that's no biggie. At least I can save whenever and wherever I want unlike Bloodbored...hahaha. 02-04-16 UPDATE-- Whyyyy?! Whyyyy?! Why does this game have to be so good and take up my free time?!! Why?!! Side note- I am struggling with organizing my inventory to prevent being overburdened, but it does add to the great experience. Time to learn more about organization and prioritization people.

The amount of fun in one frickin game is mesmerizing. This game should be a 100 bucks. CD projekt red, I love you all.",10,2016-02-03,PLAYSTATION 4,user
CriticsCave,"EPIC! I can tell you with a certain assurance, that most negative 'user' reviews are from gamers who didn't actually complete witcher 3 for various reasons, but mainly because the controls and gameplay are difficult. With that said, I had a bad time at the start, and I did not understand a lot of quests, or mechanics. But when I got into the game a second time, I had a total blast... First of all: The game is massive! I don't think any open world, as rich as the northern realms, is that large. And not only is it massive, but it's alive, and active! There is always something going on around the corner of the woods where the leshens creep, there will always be creatures in Novigrad, where the children weep. Gameplay- 10/10 Performance - 8/10 Graphics - 10/10 Voice acting - 10/10 Soundtrack - 10/10 Main story - 10/10 Side content - 10/10",10,2016-02-02,PLAYSTATION 4,user

justnotintoyou,"I thought the game was beautiful, but there was something about it that just didn't do it for me. While the game has set the standard in play and beautiful background, with deep sea diving, gorgeous detail, and beautiful scenery, the storyline itself was a little off. Every one of the characters seem a little cold. Yennifer, Triss, etc. The only warmth came from Ciri and then not really. The world was a Hobbes playground where life was harsh, brutish, and short. IT just wasn't that satisfying **** to play. In all honesty, I liked DAI a lot better.",4,2016-01-30,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Myrkur,"This game is HUGE, there are a lot of things to do, the scenarios are amazing and the soundtrack is really nice. Although that I really had a lot of fun, the combat feels clumsy, seems too simple and not as enjoyable as it could be. There are also some lag that I suffered on the big cities. So, if you want story, a really good scenario and immersion, then you MUST buy it, but, if you want a game centered in combat, try another game.",8,2016-01-29,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The game is more or less like watching a movie or reading a choose your own adventure book. The graphics are fantastic, the story is relatively intriguing, and the choices you make do affect the outcome, but the gameplay and emotional connection to anyone or anything is lacking. The cutscenes are just too long and frequent....I needed more to do. Thanks for the film, but the game isn't close to the level of Elder Scrolls material.",6,2016-01-28,PLAYSTATION 4,user

ason313,"Beautiful game with a deep complex story with just a few blemishes that hold it back. The story is well told and acted by life like character models. Nice that whether you want to be a jerk or saint, Geralt is still a bad-ass either way. Gameplay is tight and variable to your play-style. Assassins creed style sword fighting with your choice of magic/potion approach. Learning curve is steep due to many things to monitor, but ultimately rewarding and satisfying. However, game seems to be confused about whether it wants to you explore or bound through the story... if you explore you'll be too over-leveled for missions, if you don't you run a big risk of missing quests, including some that can effect the end of the game. Careful for bugs as well, some can be gamebreaking (MAKE A LOT OF SAVES!). Still, it earns its 9 because the good truly outweighs the bad and it seems developers are patching some of the worst bugs. One of the best games out on PS4.",9,2016-01-26,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Darrus_,"This game is okay. There, I said it. Fight me on the side of the street, fanboys. My main grudge with the game is just how uninteresting the characters were. Geralt is this ""edgy"" guy, with a voice actor who strains his voice so hard to sound tough that he can't even raise his voice. Yennefer really isn't that attractive, and reminds me of the emos at high school (Triss is pretty hot, though) Ciri, to me, is just some **** with daddy problems. Vesemir tries to pull off the ""old wise guy"" character, but he ends up just being a creep. The open world is pretty interesting, though. And the game itself looks stunning. The combat system is pretty rusty. There's really no point having the dodge mechanic when you can just spam the attack button and get things done quicker. The story is pretty interesting, but I really wanted to get involved in the Nilfgaard vs Redania war. Overall, it's meh.",7,2016-01-25,PLAYSTATION 4,user
RodSal,"Em português (in portuguese) Bom, não há o que contestar, the witcher 3 é o jogo do ano de 2015, sem dúvidas. Estou escrevendo esse review depois de ter posto minhas mãos em diversos títulos de 2014-2015, incluindo Bloodborne, Fallout 4, Metal Gear Solid V. É o tipo de jogo que vai fazer voce ficar curioso para o próximo passo. Você se identifica com o personagem e todos ao seu redor. As ações possuem consequências que podem ser devastadoras, sempre com prós e contras. Sem dúvidas um jogo para ser apreciado, ter calma e paciência, dialogar com os personagem, explorar o imenso mundo aberto e caçar muitas recompensas como caçador de bruxas. Claro, o jogo não é perfeito, possuem algumas falhas que poderiam ser previstas, como por exemplo as arvores de talentos, que há muitas habilidades pouco ou nada exploráveis. As missões para caça às bruxas também podem ser repetitivas, mas no geral são muito bem feitas. Os itens como armaduras e poções não tem tanto valo de uso. Você basicamente utilizará mais as que curam, deixando uma grande quantidade de opções de lado (no geral a alquimia é pouco explorada no game, ou diria que pouco chamativa ao jogador). Usar seu sentido de bruxo é o ponto forte do game, além de suas habilidades elementais, como o fogo e o domínio mental do inimigo! As quests secundárias são outro ponto forte, na minha opinião, é onde voce verá o lado sombrio, por muitas vezes, do game. Nelas, voce poderá decidir o destino desses personagens e em todos ao seu redor. Na boa, esse jogo é espetacular. Se voce curte elementos de rpg com uma história incrível, diálogos, decisões que te levam a diversas trajetórias e elementos de combate para cortar o inimigo ao meio, COMPRE ESSE JOGO AGORA!",10,2016-01-25,PLAYSTATION 4,user
ArenaV3,"The pinnacle of AAA titles in 2015. I got this game back around whenever it was released and could never really get into it. I put it on the back burner for a few months, and tried again. Once again, couldn't get into it. I then got consumed into Fallout 4 for a bit but got quickly bored of it. This weekend, after being disgusted with the amount of critical acclaim the Witcher achieved over Fallout 4, I decided to do intense research and practice with the game and I will say it is incredible. Better than Fallout 4 in nearly every aspect. Writing: Honestly one of the best quests I have ever played. The writing is fantastic, the quests are fun, emotional, and somtimes, funny. The characters are also quite good. I love the personalities in particular of Geralt and the Baron. Graphical: The graphics are nice. Water is very well done. The lighting and environment is very nice. Nothing unique per se, just realistic medieval and wilderness graphics. The monsters and armors are very creative; some look cool as **** (Wild Hunt Armor), and some look downright disgusting (Rotfiends, Botchlings). Technical: The game runs at 1080p, 30 FPS on the PS4, typical with many console games. The combat is decent, the only really bad thing I have to say, but it is still quite good. It requires strategy rather than hacking the **** out of someone as say the Elder Scrolls. Movement can be a bit sticky too, I've accidentally fallen off of ledges quite a bit. Overall: So damn good. You will probably love it if you're patient and willing to learn in the game and outside of the game (YouTube, Reddit).",9,2016-01-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Toda a relação da Ciri com o Geralt construída apenas com detalhes em diálogos feitos com outros personagens (Triss, Yennefer, Zoltan...) é magistral, principalmente levando em consideração o fato de que só passamos cerca de 30% do jogo com ela, e quando a encontramos, já estamos completamente simpatizados com ela.

Bayonetwork1989,"When I first brought The Witcher 3 on release I was worried I'd be overwhelmed by how big this game is and how much there is to do, but after a couple of hours I was fully immersed in the lore of The Witcher, wondering off to uncover the secrets of this world and then realsing I've just bought one of the best games I've played. The Witcher 3 has become an example of what open world RPG's should be like. There isn't one section of land in this game which feels like it's been copied and pasted from somewhere else, or rushed together. The buildings, towns and cities have been built into the landscape, but gives you the feel of being transported into another world, which strangley feels real (even though you're fighting Griffins and casting magical signs!). I loved every second of The Witcher 3 and even though I was sad to come to the end of the main story, I quickly realised I still had much more to do. The only small negative I have is that I felt like I was leveling too quickly towards the end of the game, which made me feel a bit over powed, even though I was at the recommended level for that particular quest and I also felt that the inventory screen could've been better thought out (even after the patch which changed this screen). Overall, I love The Witcher 3 and I'll be playing it for a long time.",9,2016-01-22,PLAYSTATION 4,user

I was really on the spot about this game because I was deciding if I should buy this or Fallout 4, and I dont regret it, every minute of my playthrough was worth the price, this is truely an awesome RPG, if not one of the best RPG (one problem tho, controlling Geralt feels clunky and hard)",10,2016-01-20,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The quest-line is nice, the comic-style animated cutscenes are sweet too. I especially like the fact that many random, totally minor quests have their story and they made typical ""find item X and slay Y monsters"" quest fun and engaging, good job with this! Nonetheless, game has it's downsides and they are mostly technical. The combat system feels rubber-bandy, I feel like it's not up to me to control the character, the responsiveness could also be an issue. It seems like it's supposed to feel like combat it Batman, but it doesn't quite do the job. There are many noticeable fps drops and collision glitches, which is an effect to complex geometry and big world. The most important thing it the interface, which is slow, over-complicated (the mini map is helpful though), and the thing that bugs me is that world map is not directly accessible, but requires two steps to perform.",6,2016-01-11,PLAYSTATION 4,user
glypheye,"I""m historically not a fan of action/adventure RPG's, so took a chance on this one. It took me awhile to get used to the multiple menu trees and seeing the slow, progressive results in combat effectiveness after slowly building skills abilities within these trees. On the graphical fidelity/performance front, frames-per-second on PS4 is a little sludgy, but I've gotten used to this in the context of the AC series and overall, if the sense of immersion/detailed ""world"" is there, I am willing to overlook limited performance (but that's to a point, I'll say. For instance, right now I'm having trouble overlooking the awful graphics/performance of games such as Fallout 4, though the depth of detail of stuff to explore, find, craft, do is pretty amazing). I'd say the art designers did a superb job overall, though. So many little things shine to help with immersion, such as the changing weather, time of day and getting all the little sounds of the outdoors mixed in to enhance the experience. The sound and sight of wind moving through the trees is noticed and appreciated! As mentioned, in terms of gameplay itself, there was a learning curve that I had to trudge through, in the beginning very low levels, to get to the good **** the sense of fun. In that respect, there was a degree of trust to access that all the glowing critic/user reviews were attesting to something there that I just needed to have the patience in order to dig to discover. Again, all secondary to my lack of experience with the overall slower pace associated with RPG's. Just now (and only about 12 hours into the game! so much more fun ahead :) ) the full appreciation of what the devs have done in creating W3 is emerging. A big part of that is the superb writing. The story and side stories themselves. They are strange, magical, and unique (at least to me) in a way that I find exciting. I'm not a hardcore gamer by any stretch of the imagination, but much of the ""story telling"" in gaming seems a little contrived/repetitive to me. W3 is an exception, in my perspective. The fantasy story is well written and helps to drive the experience forward from mission to mission. I literally have no idea what's coming next, but am beginning to expect to be pleasantly surprised and intrigued. So, all in all, a long-winded way of saying that W3 is capturing the heart of a primarily first person shooter fan. It is a great game and deserving of being in the upper tier of anyone's top 10 list.",10,2016-01-09,PLAYSTATION 4,user

fry22guy,"Combining the high fantasy from the first game and the breathtaking storytelling from the sequel, Witcher 3 is is the greatest payoff game ever created. What may seem like an overwhelming amount of content to most is really the greatest strength of the game, and shows what other developers lack. CDProjectRed has created a world that is so interesting, well-written, and graphically stunning that one would blame them for NOT creating hours and hours of content for it. It's this content that gives the game life, of the likes which gaming has never seen before. NPC's aren't just there to take up space, each one has a purpose and many have something unique and interesting to say. And this isn't just walls of text as you run from one NPC to the next, this is living, breathing dialogue that is delivered convincingly, as if it were a film. One thing is for certain about Witcher 3, and that is that one never questions the authenticity of the world. The story continues to show CDProjectRed's growth as storytellers, improving on Witcher 2's already impressive writing. While the ending was a bit underwhelming, the journey to get there was emotional and riveting from even the smallest of side-quests.

fequalma1,"Witcher 3 redefines the open world RPG genre. This is the game ****. I cannot think of enough adjectives and superlatives to do this game justice. Refined, Polished, Thoughtful, Witty, Gritty, Complex, Awe-inspiring.. and so much more. Every side-quest defies your expectations. There are no mindless fetch quests in this game. from my experience. I enjoyed every single side quest and monster contract I took on. Every single one. Which is really rare...because i have come to expect LESS from game companies these days after a series of ""AAA"" disappointments from North American studios. Just when you think you know where the sub-plot in a quest is going, it takes a twist. And another twist. And you are faced with REAL, CONSEQUENTIAL decisions. Not the meaningless **** decisions that have zero effect on the game world you will find in Bethesda's Fallout 4. Consider this, I have not played any previous Witcher games, and I have no idea what a Witcher even was before playing this game. However it completely drew me in. I couldn't stop playing. I think I've put in more than 50-60 hours playing at a leisurely pace, and finished the main story and all the main side quests. Yet I have explore only 25-30% of the OPEN world portion of the game. There are VAST forests and caverns with interesting, useful loot, and monsters roaming the wilds that I have yet to kill. I cannot say enough good things about this game.

phuck-overkill,"Pros: Just about everything about this game is incredible. Even with the unfortunate graphical downgrade it still looks amazing. The story, characters, and setting are just incredible and lifelike, this game really pulled me into its world. A single playthrough will take you about 70-80 hours if you rush, and can easily break 100 hours if you explore everything. CD Projekt Red are my favorite developer right now, for good reason. Not just for the quality work they've done with the Witcher series but also because of their business practices. They continued to support the game by releasing free DLC which included new armor sets, hair/facial hair options, outfits for other NPCs, weaponry, AND new quests. All that for free, in this day and age? It's wonderful. In addition, they are releasing 2 expansion packs. Actual expansion packs with new locations, characters, storylines, and so many more hours of content. They really lift my spirits when seemingly almost every other developer/publisher wants to just defecate out a game, and support it for a limited time with paid DLC. Cons: The only downside to this game that I see most people complain about is the combat. I can understand why, it is sort of basic. You're essentially limited to swords (although there are axes, their stats are almost always outclassed by Witcher swords) and the crossbows are more of a tool to stumble enemies/bring down flying enemies. But there are some other ways to make combat more interesting. Witcher signs (spells) that you can cast, and potions to collect and craft.

Naveen196,"A must-have PS4 title. What this game brings is a mature, sensitive and violent story. The main quest involves exchanging information with various individuals for information on Ciri's location, your adopted daughter. It may feel slightly padded out, but is gripping nonetheless. Where this game shines is in the side quests, which also involve Witcher contracts, where you gotta kill monsters for your paycheck. It almost brings a detective-like gameplay element, I quite like it. Every single side quest has obsessive attention to detail, and, in my opinion, are better than the main quest itself. The combat could use improvements. It may get repetitive at times, and the controls may sometimes get wonky, but it is still fun, with cool swordplay and magic. With each level tou gain, you can invest in certain skills to eventually unlock new and powerful moves. The open world is absolutely gorgeous and dense with stuff to do. There will be many moments where you'll turn off your HUD and take a screenshot. With the latest updates, the framerate is a very stable 30 fps. All in all, what makes Witcher 3 one of the best games of this generation, and my personal favourite RPG, is the story. This game WILL consume a lot of your time, around 50 hours for just the main story. And youre gonna love it. There will be some instances which require Witcher 1/2 knowledge, so I recommend reading the Compendium (included in the boxed game). Game of the Year material.",10,2015-12-21,PLAYSTATION 4,user

MetaKritiker90,"This game is LEGENDARY! One of the best games of all time. The story, music, characters, the world, it's all so good!

JJtheTexan,"It's not the best-looking game on the platform by a longshot, but my gosh is this a technical triumph. The entire game and all its DLC are here, fully-intact. It just works. Yes, you're better off playing The Witcher 3 on practically any other platform, but if all you have is a Nintendo Switch, you'll still have a fantastic time adventuring with Geralt and friends.",10,2023-05-02,NINTENDO SWITCH,user

Ripper36,Yes this is not as shape as a ps4 pro or a mighty PC but the Switch versions has everything else going for it. The other consels cant take their games to go can they? NO. Graphics are still good and it plays very smooth considering how huge the game is. Dozens and Dozens of content in a small game card. I am very Impressed on how they ported this game. Its is truly one of the best Games EVER made. Great job Nintendo!,10,2021-09-22,NINTENDO SWITCH,user

JTHafley,The Switch edition of this game is not the best out there but the fact that you can take this amazing game on the go and play it in your hands is amazing. The game plays good on handheld and I've put in 100+ hours in handheld mode. If you want a deep game on the go you can dump some time into this is a must on the Switch and one of my favorites,9,2021-07-02,NINTENDO SWITCH,user
Entei92,"Es una auténtica maravilla poder disfrutar de este juegazo en Nintendo Switch. No me voy a extender en mencionar todas las bondades que tiene, pues esto lo podréis encontrar en cualquier otro análisis de Xbox, Pc o Ps4; me ceñiré al apartado gráfico en Switch. Con la última actualización, que permite acceder a la configuración visual, el juego se ve increíble. Si bien en la TV es menos disfrutable, en modo portátil es una verdadera experiencia visual, se reducen enormemente las diferencias con máquinas de mayor potencia, y, el poder disfrutar de esta aventura en cualquier sitio y donde tu quieras, no tiene precio. Considero que este port, con la nueva configuración gráfica, vale cada céntimo que pagues.",10,2021-06-11,NINTENDO SWITCH,user
