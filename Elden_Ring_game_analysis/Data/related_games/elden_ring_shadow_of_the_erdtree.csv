EldenSchmutz,"Unglaublicher Müll! Ich frage mich ernsthaft, was mit den Menschen heutzutage nicht stimmt, dass sie so ein dermaßen schlechtes Spiel feiern können. Es sieht nicht nur aus wie der letzte Mist, sondern stellt sich in den meisten Fällen auch als genau das heraus: absoluter Schrott. Die Möglichkeit, das Spiel zu pausieren? Fehlanzeige. Logisch durchdachte Level? Genauso wenig vorhanden. Stattdessen bekommt man ein chaotisches Durcheinander serviert, das weder Spaß noch Sinn ergibt. Wie kann so etwas ernsthaft positiv aufgenommen werden? Das Gameplay ist einfach nur frustrierend, die Grafik eine absolute Katastrophe, und von Innovation fehlt jede Spur. Ich verstehe wirklich nicht, wie man bei so einem unterirdischen Produkt auch nur einen Funken Begeisterung empfinden kann. Es wirkt, als hätte niemand wirklich Herzblut oder Mühe hineingesteckt, und trotzdem wird es gefeiert. Unbegreiflich!",0,2025-02-07,PC,user

Darxevn,"A great addition to Elden Ring that amounts to a full game of content. that is very nearly equal in quality of the original in every way. The new areas and characters and bosses built into the game are fantastic. The items/spells added give you many new gameplay options to explore that are a lot of fun. The leveling system works over all but has just one catch. Your power ends up being based on how much exploration you do. This might not be ideal when you are replying on additional characters. Additionally, there are a few areas on the map that can be difficult or confusing to understand how to get to them. Additionally, there is one optional area where they've basically added a stealth mechanic that is a miss for me personally. So for those reasons I knock 1 point off of this amazing expansion.",9,2024-11-02,PC,user

BaltiPorta,"A game in the game. Very cool. However, it has it's flaws. Fighting against big bosses and the camera at the same time is not fun. Bosses using big f-off one shot combo just to say ""you won't beat me first try"" is goofy and annoying. The grabs' hitboxes are infuriating. And the choice of final boss and the story around them was a huge deception. Also, the level up system is really not that good. Apart from these, a solid game for a flawless track record of bangers from fromsoftware.",7,2024-10-30,PC,user
abdulwizard,"The game is not fun at all. It's only for people who are chasing more challenge (the only thing the game can offer you is more difficulty), but the game world is too nonsense, confusing and boring. Sometimes you walk in the world and think ""who the f* designed this map? What the h* is this place?"". As if it weren't ugly and nonsense enough, it's also full of mazes - I mean, why they have to make the map so confusing? I already didn't feel like continuing, but I stopped after spending 10 minutes hitting a golem so it could kill me in 1 hit. No desire to finish this game.

Sanbarra,"Elden Ring is one of the best games ever made, but the DLC actually... is not. World is very empty. The first region is fine, but all others feel soulless. Especially the bosses are dissappointing. I liked 4 of them, but even my favorite of the dlc would be just mid/average compared to the phenomenal bosses of the main game. Yet, I'm hyped, what comes next, since there are some very good ideas in it, like the Sword of Light/Night, Spirit Ashes with Micro Quests, and a stealth region - which doesn't work well, but I think, the DLC proves, Fromsoftware is trying new things for their next big game. Ah, and the balance system is not working out in my eyes. Either you are way to underpowered at the beginning or way to overpowered later. Still have no idea, what Mesmers Movekit is.

filippo333,"Shadow of the Erdtree is a mixed bag. It’s a good expansion on the surface, but the open world doesn’t really provide that many useful rewards to the player. It’s more of the same you get in the base game; with the exception that you’re likely already a high level, so most of the items you find are forgettable. The visuals are incredible and the art team never fails to impress. Equally the boss designs are creative and as grotesque as ever; more on that a bit later. The open world is also fairly interesting to explore, although it feels a bit too empty. There are a lot of reskinned enemies and NPC invasions disguised as bosses. This is where things start to go downhill, NPC invasions are very lazy replacements for bosses and artificially increases the difficulty of the game unless you happen to play a broken build. The boss difficulty is what really ruins the game for me. Most of the bosses are near impossible to beat without summons. They have extremely long combos, one shot abilities, very high aggression leaving no time for healing and do an incredible amount of damage with most of their moves. I really hope that FromSoft doesn’t continue down this path, they’ve replaced fun but fair game design with the Dark Souls II approach; extreme difficulty for the sake of difficulty. Is SotET worth buying? No. As someone that loves FromSoft games, it’s extremely inaccessible to even seasoned Souls players. The balance of challenge vs reward is broken leaving a bad taste in my mouth. I think FromSoft has finally surpassed the game being overly difficult and have prioritised that over interesting boss and enemy designs.",5,2024-10-06,PC,user
vexentnex,"They said ""The Elden Ring DLC is going to be so good!"" aaaand no its not. It is a desperate cash grab from our loved friend FromSoftware. I feel like they literally didnt try to do something good. They just saw what they did, and tried to longer the experience by hiding behind ""difficulty"". Im saying these considering the performance issues, absolute trash map design, miserable bosses, a plot that nobody cares about... i think you got the point. I hope this is a joke and they will release the real DLC soon but.... eh, you know that aint happening. dont buy this pieceof garbage.",1,2024-09-29,PC,user
Uklorian,"Shadow of the Erdtree is only a DLC in name and could easily be considered game of the year. It has outstanding environment, worldbuilding, and level design as we have come to expect from FromSoft. The new spells and weapons were engaging, and the new enemies presented unique challenges. Unsurprisingly the visuals were stunning and the music was exceptional. Top it off with some of the finest voice acting in the genre and you have one of this year's greatest games. The only disappointment was the ""Abyssal Woods"" section which was a chore to get through.",10,2024-09-20,PC,user

When i played Dark Souls i felt like i was having epic fights and when i was losing it was only my fault, here i feels like i schouldn't even fight this boss and it wasnt made for players to defeat. Nerds will say ""skill issue"" while they were using same broken builds. I want tto have fun! i want to use my OWN build! but there certain builds doesn't work.

If you do not play with phantoms and sammons, of all the varieties of builds, there are 3-4 with which you can defeat the boss without completely memorizing attacks, but at the same time you will break all their mechanics.That's it, the developers are now designing bosses in the expectation that you will kill them in co-op, and the solo game has turned into a circus with endless rolling.Open world like Ubisoft's games)))",2,2024-07-28,PC,user

tsmasher1000,"Gameplay: 3/5 Game design: 2/5 Story: 3/5 Music: 4/5 Graphics: 5/5 TL;DR, graphics are wonderful and the places are stunningly beautiful. There is much questionable design in making a world that is so huge but feels unrewarding to explore; the enemy designs are oftentimes repetitive/questionable, the game may have frame drops which in a very punishing game not only ruins immersion but may lead to unfair deaths, and open world is questionable.Warning, long incoming review. I thoroughly enjoyed Elden Ring and have 100%'d the game. I enjoyed the first half, but the second half was a slog to get through. I had high hopes for Elden Ring's DLC, but sadly it feels more of the same of the second half of Elden Ring, which I actually had to force myself to get through it. Let's break it down. Let's first get out of the way the graphics, music, and presentation. Elden Ring is stunningly beautiful and the DLC showcases some of the best imaginative areas you will find in any open world game. The music is epic (though perhaps immemorable at least to me). Elden Ring showcases the problems of Souls games going open-world, but also showcases the great potential of it. At first I was very skeptical of a Souls game going open world, but to my delightful surprise the first half was a masterpiece. It was fun to explore the world and find quests and create your build. However, this quickly dissipates in both the second half and the DLC. There are several reasons this occurs. Elden Ring is VERY difficult, no surprise there - it's a Souls game. However, with this difficulty it also feels difficult to experiment. It may be just be my personal experience, but I had trouble switching builds after getting accustomed to a single build and getting another build to work without outside advice and getting outside advice is not always fun (backseat gaming is not the most fun especially when attempting to avoid spoilers). With this, game design becomes questionable, as you have all of this world to explore, but repetitive enemy designs - MANY of which are reused even in the DLC, a lack of variety of things to do (other than combat), and a very punishing system for death (death leads to a loss of runes which while you can collect back is not always guaranteed) makes exploration feel thoroughly unrewarding when you have your build down and at times even disincentivizing given that the game can be very punishing by losing all your runes upon death, so why go fight bosses and experiment if it runs that risk and I already have my build down? I feel that this has not been fixed in the DLC either as many players - probably the vast majority - will have a late game to endgame build in the DLC and I felt unincentivized to try anything new given how hard the game was. The enemy designs are SO questionable. This is not even talking about their difficulty, but the feeling of repetition. There are many reused enemy designs in the DLC (although there are many new enemies as well), but I felt that the problem was it felt extremely repetitive in how I took down almost every enemy and boss in the game. I think I heard it best at one point in time from another review, but Elden Ring is Sekiro if Sekiro took away much of the tools you had to battle some of the outrageous bosses. The idea here is that the bosses and enemies are way too aggro and very often it is possible with an endgame build to get 2 shot or even 1 shot by many of their moves, so much of the time I would be forced to play something similar to Sekiro but without the tools of Sekiro and be forced to dodge roll for 95% of the fight while rarely getting any attacks in - when do you get to play the game? When the AI feels like it can stop attacking for one second to spare you a moment to attack and if you miss that moment you could just die. Now even if it seems like I am complaining about the difficulty here, which to some extent I am, I feel justified in the idea that it's not just difficult but repetitive and not fun to be forced to play in the same way much of the time until you learn some slightly different timing on the new boss and endure their 10 combo attacks for one small attack on your end. Even if you could say git gud I do think that it is boring and while spirit summons does somewhat fix the nonstop barrage, it makes it once again boring and repetitive to whale on the enemy while they're preoccupied with your spirit summons and finish them off like that. There's a lack of balance there that I feel that summons should not have been added to a Souls game at all, nor an open world. This is compounded twofold in the DLC where every major boss is like this and the non-major bosses lack any uniqueness. Last, open world as said before is questionable. It is quite beautiful, but empty and not really interesting to explore - much more of the same and much more **** to go from point A to point B. You can also easily miss NPC dialogues, quests, and dialogue from the open world.",6,2024-07-23,PC,user

Fshoxkhg,"As a long time FromSoft fan, I'm extremely pleased with Shadow of the Erdtree. They've managed to up the difficulty without making it so overbearing as to kill the fun. Easily some of the best battle content from FromSoft to date, although I do feel Bloodborne still presents an overall better experience on that front. Every fight is fair and can be cleared with a minimum of issues if you're willing to spend even a moment analyzing boss attack patterns. Even the final boss, who some erroneously claim to be fair, really isn't. Everything is clearly telegraphed and easy to react to. The new equipment has been most welcome. We received several new weapon types, examples of which are sufficiently tuned to be used in all forms of content present within the game. These new items, barring a handful of exceptions, have been introduced without damaging the delicate balance of PvP. FromSoft is known for leaving a lot of questions hanging in the air once their games are complete. In an uncharacteristically charitable move, they deviated from their norm by providing answers to just about any question regarding the games lore. One need simply go seeking, and they'll learn just about anything they want to about Marika, her consorts, her children, her origins, etc. It's all right there, waiting to be found.",9,2024-07-22,PC,user

Amsheagar,"Best DLC ever. It is much more a whole game, than a DLC. I discovered everything, killed every boss without summon and spirit and i rarely traveled on horse back, thats why i spent 102 hours with this dlc. I usually end the games slower than the average player, but i think there is atleast 50 hours of game content for an average player. The most conspicuous thing is the improvement of the bosses, nearly every boss have amazing moveset, and animation and they are harder of course. The story is interesting as ever in a fromsoftware game. The music and the vertical terrain and enviroment are all amazing. If you liked the base game, you MUST play this!",10,2024-07-22,PC,user

SlamminBananas,"This is a review of the entirety of Elden Ring not just its DLC! For me its a no brainier that From Software took everything they've learned from their previous game and perfected them in Elden Ring. Class variety, weapon choices, spells just about everything related to game play is at its strongest in here. Which is why it hurts for me to not give it a perfect score. Like with most recent gaming releases today Elden Ring suffers from bloat. The base game already felt like some of the smaller dungeons should have been cut and the levels made smaller, but its expansion Shadow of the Erdtree made this feeling truly felt for me. Instead of clamoring for the next section and upcoming bosses all I felt was a sense of how much running, walking and riding am I going to have to do before I finally get to what I ultimately wanted to experience the boss fights.",8,2024-07-12,PC,user

aitorsibo,"Dark Souls IV open world. The keys of the Souls saga are there: Greatly built bosses, enormous challenges, intriguing and dark plot, and RPG mechanics. It is great. I really like the gameplay, building my character the way I want and improving on the go. Constantly learning and immersed in this beautiful and sad world. Visuals and sound are spot on, the game feels great to play. I'm mostly always intrigued by what and who I will find and to see the semi-opaque plot develop.I don't like: It is too damn long, my full playthrough took 93 hours, and I was looking at the clock speedrunning a bit for the last 10. I also think it loses part of the souls charm in its massive open world, giving in to excessive repetition of challenges (damn you catacombs) and bosses. The greatest parts are its close spaces, the main areas where the big bosses are (similar case to the last metro game). Also, if I find a character and its sole response when I talk to him is ""hmmm"" I eventually give up on all of them. This is a major weakness of souls, obfuscating too much the story and quests to the point in which you either give in to the online wikis or completely ignore questlines. I've had a bit of both in this game. I'm okay with consulting a wiki from time to time to better make my decisions, but this is just too much.Summary: I'd rather have a semi open-world, featuring half the length of this one with the more trascendental and impactful moments and putting more thought in accessibility and better informing the players to help them take their decisions regarding build and quests. Great game even with the mentioned flaws!Shadow of the erdtree: More of the same, so if you liked the base game you'll like this. Same problems as the base game too. What I liked the most were the last two bosses and area, and Bayle's domain. The key in these is that I got emotionally invested in the fight, specially because of the NPCs, dialogue, transcendency and in the last boss case the fight itself too. I forgot how rewarding it felt to win a fight like that and I'm glad I could part ways with the game in that specific mood.",8,2024-07-09,PC,user
T-Opel,"I do not understand the bad reviews, I will go through some of the points I have seen in the bad reviews. Except for the final boss, no part of the DLC feels any harder than the base game. The only way I can imagine people feeling this is too difficult is if they completely skip the Scadutree fragments, which scale the difficulty of the DLC. So I recommend going and exploring to find them, which I found to be a great motivation to explore the visually stunning world. Yes, the NPCs and quests are weird and cryptic, but again, not at all different from the base game. So I do not see why people would only start to complain about that now. And this style of storytelling is just something I would consider integral to FromSoftware's games, there was 0 chance of them changing this in any way. So the only criticism that makes sense to me is the performance issues. I experienced them rarely, but they are definitely present. The second phase of the last boss is already hard enough without the PC now having a seizure on top of that. Overall, if you enjoyed the base game with all its quirks (that are IMO part of why the game feels so good), I recommend you buy this ASAP. If you didn't love the base game and you expected some of these quirks to get fixed, I suggest you probably stay away from this DLC because other than inventory QoL changes, this is still the same brutal, unrelentingly difficult experience.",9,2024-07-07,PC,user

mylovich,"The Shadow of the Erdtree DLC for Elden Ring is decent but has its fair share of shortcomings. While there are new additions, many aspects feel lackluster and unfinished. The DLC still features reskinned bosses, and the dungeons are really boring with almost none of them available. The map feels empty, offering minimal rewards for exploration other than cookbooks and reskinned enemies. Bosses are mediocre, with most of them not even having cutscenes, giving the impression that the DLC was rushed. There are about three legacy dungeons, all of which are mediocre compared to other FromSoftware dungeons. The DLC was marketed with the promise of eight new weapon types and over 100 new weapons. While technically true, each new weapon type has only about two weapons, and the promised 100+ weapons are mostly unattractive and ineffective. Furthermore, the performance on PC remains atrocious, similar to the base game. It's baffling that none of these complaints from the base game were addressed, especially considering how much money the base game made.",7,2024-07-02,PC,user

Tondle,"Just like Elden Ring, Shadow of the Erdtree presents amazing, surreal yet realistically crafted environment with From Software's distinctive own sense of design. But the more you desperately scour every single cornor of the map to actually find something useful such as blessings the more you get frustrated by the world only to realize its emptiness. Monsters you met in a field are reused or somehow similar with previous game series, Map showing only the surface of above ground skipping various underground worlds, No more whimsical environmental puzzles or brilliant gimmicks. Moreover, Bosses you confront in this game give you only few times of attacking while you simply get to press dodge most of boss fights. Fights in previous souls games are like understanding your opponent (knowing its reach, where to roll, weakness and such) and figuring out your timing. But in Shadow of the Erdtree, game plays are filled with dodge spamming and ridiculous camera works, leaving you with thoughts of what the actual **** is going on in boss fight. It simply doesn't feel like you beat this game not because you are actually good at this game, but because you were just lucky. Since souls game's community has the most toxic fan base, there are certain requirements you need to meet if you don't get called 'git gud', like not using ashes or not spamming magic, etc, only using swords and perfectly understanding boss patterns. Now that people actually beat this game with meeting these toxic requirements and say this game is just full of nothing but dodge spamming, fans of this game claim they never present those criteria and this game is not hard since you can use magic, ashes and help of other users ? If you got nothing in your life and you want to satisfy your desire of recognition from random people for doing useless ****, this game is for you.",2,2024-07-01,PC,user

Purlot,"Assuming the base game is a 10/10, this DLC is an 9/10. It excels in the same areas as the base game: art, music, scenery, enemy and weapon design, etc. Backhand Blades and Hand-to-hand Arts are cool and fun, and some of the new high-fantasy AoWs look anime-inspired. Some complaints about balance issues, such as overly aggressive and agile bosses that leave too little opportunity for players to counter, and broken camera when locked-on, are valid and need improvement. But overall, I find overcoming such challenges more rewarding than frustrating. On the other hand, performance and optimization are subpar, with frequent frame drops and stuttering. I remember the base game had similar issues at launch that were quickly addressed, so hopefully, the DLC will follow suit. My biggest disappointment, however, is the flawed reward system for exploration. While walking through the gorgeous realm of shadow is enjoyable, there are too many useless stones and flowers for the effort. We defeated Mohg to access the DLC!

The new DLC zone is simply amazing to explore and look at, new enemy types everywhere and the music is once again perfect for that dark fantasy gameplay.

All of the new bosses had really cool designs with badass move sets (although a few of them were pretty cheap at times). Tons of other new great enemies as well just scattered around the world. There are a few repeat mini bosses from the main game, but that's not really an issue since the overwhelming majority of the enemies were new. Well worth the price of admission.

RunaMerone,"Elden Ring is one of my all-time favourite games and has been since it came out a year ago. Shadow of the Erdtree is quite possibly the best expansion pack/DLC pack I've ever played. Not only is it more of the kind of content I loved in the base game but it has some of the best bosses, best level design, and best world design/aesthetic in the entire franchise. There's enough content here to be a sequel. I'm not even kidding. 40+ Bosses, dozens of dungeons and areas, and a world map that is layered and has more content packed into it than Limgrave and Caelid combined (Including Weeping Peninsula)Yeah, it's hard, but that's what you want. Wouldn't it be pretty boring if the expansion offered no challenge? If you use the DLC-exclusive upgrade system (which was well balanced for the DLC's difficulty) then you'll be fine. Sounds to me like a lot of people playing the game wrong and blaming the game for it. Much like how some people complained about the boss design in the base game being poor because they refused to use the tools given to them like Spirit summons. Shadow of the Erdtree is amazing.

japgamesucks,"The new areas introduced in Shadow of the Erdtree are vast and sprawling, but they often feel empty and devoid of meaningful content. While the environments themselves are visually impressive, they lack the intricate details and engaging activities that made the Lands Between so captivating in the base game. This emptiness extends to the DLC's side quests, which are often repetitive and fail to offer any compelling rewards or narrative payoffs. The DLC's narrative, while thematically interesting, feels disjointed and poorly paced. The story seems to exist solely to justify a series of boss encounters, rather than serving as a cohesive and engaging narrative arc. This results in a story that feels underdeveloped and ultimately forgettable. One of the strengths of the base game was its emphasis on exploration and discovery, rewarding players for venturing off the beaten path. Shadow of the Erdtree, however, often feels like it punishes players for exploration, with hidden areas often leading to dead ends or underwhelming rewards. This discourages exploration and makes the DLC feel more linear and less immersive. Overall, Shadow of the Erdtree is a disappointing addition to Elden Ring. While it offers a few new and interesting areas to explore, it is marred by cheap difficulty spikes, empty environments, a disjointed narrative, and a lack of meaningful rewards for exploration.

Some will say you can fight [insert boss name] without it, but overall it's not meant to be possible in some area unless you plan to spend hours/ day learning non-telegraphed attacks, appearing randomly at any time, with many attack 1 shoting your 60 vigor character, with close to zero windows to punish. This is the result of scaling, and overtuned boss (3x hp bar/ 2x dmg). In other word, From made you start the DLC at NG - 8, so find the scaling items to come back from your hole, and stabilize back at NG+0. The first patch will nerf close to everything about boss and difficulty design, splitting the already ugly community in half, the guy who finish the game pre-patch and the others... Another common issue started with DSK3 is the huge gab between your character defense tools, and the godlike moves every main boss have, using lightspeed moves combined with spells that send planets at you. This trend end-up with this game and DLC. If you want a good recent fromgame, strick with the last ArmoredCore and/or Sekiro. **** you From.",1,2024-06-25,PC,user

xVimpex,"At the time of this review, I fought about half of the Main Bosses and explored two of the four regions. So keep this in mind when reading this review. I've played through the main game a couple of times and played every game that From Software has published since Demon Souls in 2009. Scope: The amount of content you get with this DLC is insane. It's almost another game to begin with. You have about 10 new Main Bosses and several unique mini Bosses. New regions and Legacy Dungeons are also included. The new weapon types are a highlight as well. Story is also decent, but in typical From Software fashion more in the backround. 40€ are not enough If you ask me, for what content you get. Bosses (Spoilers!!!!) and Enemys: So far I faced Renella, Devine Beast, Bayle, Messmer and the Rotten Knight. Everyone of them is at least a nine out of ten Boss In my opinion and Messmer Is From Software at their best. Mini Bosses are also a great improvement compared to the base game. Most of them are unique and fun to fight, There are some reused Bosses like Dragons or the Death Bird, but they are not crucial for the quality of the DLC. Difficulty: Don't get me wrong. SOTE is extremly hard, but fair. Every Boss I faced had clear openings and ways to beat them. You can also use the Scadu Siblings to make you're playthrough much easier. Don't let reviews descourage you. Everything in this DLC can be beaten with a little time investment. SOTE compared to the base game: SOTE is much better than the base game of Elden Ring, which was already very good. Mini Bosses and smaller dungeons are completly different to one another which was a big problem in the base game. Legacy Dungeons are also improved as well as the main Bosses. The new weapon types are also a great addition to the already existing pool of tools. SOTE feels like the true vision From Soft had in mind when creating Elden Ring. Conclusion: SOTE is a masterful addition to Elden Ring. It delivers in every aspect and I would recommend it to everyone that liked the base game and soulslikes in general.",10,2024-06-25,PC,user

ShivaX,"Ultimately it's just an amplification of all the worst aspects of Elden Ring. The old days of Hard but Fair that was the hallmark of Dark Souls are gone. Now it's ""Hard and Cheap"". Enjoy dodging in a sea of visual clutter for 20 seconds or more at a time so you can maybe hit the boss once. No more dance, no more duel, it's more like a bullet hell where you don't get to shoot back. Exploration is decent, but the world is also pretty empty. Some zones are actually empty, having almost no loot, enemies or anything else in them. They often look pretty, I guess. The Scadutree system is pretty crap. Levels don't matter, McGuffins do and they're just randomly scattered around the world, so collecting them all takes forever. Heck some are held by random mooks that you'll easily overlook. New items are almost universally meh. A few neat weapon types, but very few worth making a build around. Also that build can't come online forever because the DLC is late game. So unless you have people dropping things for you, it's kind of pointless. Tons of new incantations, very few new sorceries and most of them are underwhelming to bad. I assume the incantations are better, but Incantations were kind of bad in the base game, so maybe that evens things out a bit. Overall it's not a terrible game, but it's one of the less exciting DLCs Fromsoft has made. They've doubled down on chasing the Hardest Game crowd instead of making fun games everyone can play and enjoy. Elden Ring was a huge success in spite of it's issues, but it was also pretty easy with so many OP options to get around those issues. The DLC tries to correct that by just making everything tediously hard or annoying. Gael and Frieda were too fun to fight, so now every enemy is a Sekiro boss that you fight with a Dark Souls character. It's lame and kind of sad for someone who loves the Souls series. They seem to want to make games for a fraction of the playerbase and anymore I'm not sure I care. They did so much so right for so long, but now they're victims of their own success and the fan boys will make sure all they hear is praise. If another company does the same thing they get scorn, but when Miyazaki does it, he's a visionary. Whatever. It's middling.

OberiousLocke,"If I could link to my review for the base game, I probably would as it's more of the same trademark laziness that dominates FromSoft's design after 2014. Same overtuned difficulty that results in a tank build having anywhere from 50-90% of it's HP taken off in a single hit, same obnoxious wombo combos, same absurd attack animations that hold for so long that timing dodges becomes a game of educated guesses, so on and so forth, FromSoft flanderized their own games into being all artificial difficulty and no substance, day ends in Y.

FR32H,"Score: 8.25 / 10 This expansion feels slightly different from the base game. The first half of the expansion doesn't have the same charm as the base game and seems like a new dev worked on it. Countless dead ends, long sections of territory without any graces, very small amount of dungeons and hidden areas, and the world design in the first areas doesn't reward exploring. However, the second half of the expansion feels like the original with great world design, rewarding exploration, and good boss fights. They've changed a lot of the boss fights to make them extremely mobile, which effectively ruins any combo builds. These fights feel like you have to dodge for 5 minutes to get 1 hit in just to dodge for another 5 minutes. Along with that, they added several off your screen attacks that are very hard to see coming and dodge. This makes some of these bosses feel like less skill based and more RNG based of what attacks the bosses are using and where they are attacking from. Aside from that, most bosses require precision to win. If you're spamming attack or dodge then you're probably not going to have a good time. Learning the bosses attacks and knowing when to attack, defend, or move away is key. Also, using different weapons and talismans may be the key to success for some people. If you're banging your head against the wall on one boss, maybe put that boss on hold while you explore a different area for new weapons and scadutree fragments for the new power up system. I do like the new power up system as it doesn't let you cheese farm like the base game. This makes beating the extremely difficult bosses very rewarding (as well as getting lucky with the RNG). Overall content quantity is a bit underwhelming when looking at amount of dungeons, bosses, and hidden areas compared to the base game. Crunching the numbers this expansion is less than 30% content compared to the base game. Multiplayer is really hit or miss as the servers are having major issues. Lots of lag, damage not recording, and loosing runes when joining other players games. I didn't notice this issue during the base game launch. This expansion is a lot more buggy in general compared to the base game launch. Overall 100% worth the price and amazing job delivering a great game. It may not be 10/10 like the base game but still amazing and still light years ahead of almost every other game company.",8,2024-06-24,PC,user

First location is marvelous but after that, it is an dull and empty map, where you can journey for 20 minutes in one direction and won't find anything of value. Some locations have a Grace (checkpoint) in the middle of nowhere. Some bosses are overtuned and they just chunk your HP like you don't wear armor at all. If you have a specific built that you liked, it might not just work for this DLC. You need to switch to META. Dungeons are rare and similar. Only thing that makes them difficult is that they are long and you are running out of health. Locations are fantastic, beautiful, you just can't get enough. Music is astonishing.

Xsendd,"I have played the DLC a lot in the last few days, after 500+ hours of the base game. There are pros and cons to the DLC. While I recommend this DLC, I have mixed feelings, and if you want to know my opinion on whether this is for you, please read along. PROS: - The art is beautiful. The zones are breathtaking, the art team has done a magnificent job. The bosses also look incredible. While the art was already great in the base game, it somehow managed to outdo itself in the DLC. - The bosses are really challenging, and some of them are incredible experiences. They will not be easy to forget, and I see myself comparing souls-like games' bosses and difficulty to that of this DLC. I will not spoil anything, but it feels like fighting actual god-like beings. CONS: - The game feels dishearteningly empty. And I mean, 90% of the world is empty. The zones are so beautiful and stunning, and yet if they were replaced by a desert it would not feel much different in terms of exploration and combat. They are definitely pointlessly too big for what is in them. At times it feels like there are more goats and deers than mobs to kill. It feels like the game is a heavily forced path from boss to boss, and the rest is a scenic view simulator, rather than a world where both mobs and bosses are protagonists like the base game. It does not feel alive. - The performance is terrible. I am not able to get above 30 fps, a lot of the times I am sitting at 20 fps. I do not have the best PC, but to compare, the base game can easily get 50-60 fps in most areas. A shame to have stutters and low fps plague every area. - A lot of bosses, while beautiful, are nauseating to fight against. Between the spinning camera and the blinding lights of the attacks, I struggled to not have to take breaks. I wish they had found other ways to make bosses harder than a lot of them non-stop spinning around you and your camera rotating like a beyblade, and the clutter on the screen being so bad at times that you literally cannot see the hitbox of the attack. If you are looking for a battle simulator with amazing art and don't mind the performance, this is for you. If you are looking for an open world that feels alive, rich with lore and mobs, and a smooth experience, this is not for you. Overall, I would rate this 6/10. A decent enough DLC, but disappointing compared to the base game. If I were to go back in time, I would tell myself to watch someone do the bosses and see how beautiful the art is, and save myself 40 euros.",6,2024-06-24,PC,user

Draholt,"Pros: - More Elden Ring content - Soundtrack - New weapons, armors, and spells - Questlines are a bit easier to understand Cons: - Almost everything is reused; about 90% of non-boss enemies are from the base game, just recolored. Many structures like towers, walls, dungeons, and houses are also reused. - Too many annoying strong mobs; in multiple locations, getting from point A to point B is just a drag. - Performance issues even on high-end PCs (it’s not terrible, but for a DLC and not a new release, it is bad). - A lot of people are complaining that bosses are too hard. They are not. The problem is that 90% of builds are not viable; only one thing works well - shields! - Underwhelming ending - Like in the base game, 99% of loot is worthless. - The base game had better locations; the DLC provides no “WOW!” moments like entering Sofia Rivera or Leyndell for the first time. - The new leveling system based on those fragments is just weird and not fun.

The bosses might be quite hard but it's the main reason of Elden Ring and you can still summon help and spirit ashes to help. 10/10 Well done FromSoftware",10,2024-06-24,PC,user
darkss__eth,"""Shadow of the Erdtree"" presents a breathtaking and unique map that invites exploration, much like the base game, albeit on a slightly smaller scale. The verticality of the terrain adds an intriguing layer of complexity, though it can occasionally lead to confusion. The soundtrack is, as expected, phenomenal, enhancing the immersive experience. The bosses are well-designed and challenging, though some of them may not leave as lasting an impression as the iconic foes from the base game. The new weapons and armor sets introduced in the DLC are exciting additions that offer fresh gameplay possibilities, while also giving clues about the story. However, the scaling can feel uneven, occasionally making the game frustratingly difficult. Some enemies are so aggressive that summoning spirit ashes becomes impractical, and certain boss fights suffer from problematic camera angles, detracting from the enjoyment. The ending also leaves much to be desired, detracting from the overall experience. Despite not reaching the heights of the base game, ""Shadow of the Erdtree"" offers a worthwhile experience for fans. It may not be a perfect 10/10, but those who enjoyed the vanilla game will find much to appreciate in this DLC.",9,2024-06-24,PC,user

Rassane,"En general es mejor que el juego base en varios aspectos pero también peca de errores que tiene el juego base. Artísticamente y su banda sonora es lo mejor. En el apartado quests deja mucho que desear, son mejores las del juego base. En cuanto a lore profundo (la narrativa sigue siendo pobre), hay algún giro interesante y se continúa o explican ciertas acontecimientos sobre personajes, eventos... que dejó el juego base pero falta mucho y no habrá más dlcs... O sea historia abierta. En cuanto a lo polémico que es la dificultad,en mi opinión roza mucho de lo injusto pero no llega a serlo excepto boss final. Miyazaki no sabe ya que inventar, el sistema de ""rodar y pegar"" está anticuadísimo desde demons souls de 2009 y 5 juegos suyos con este sistema anticuado... Esto se ha visto reflejado en los jugadores y en la dificultad de este dlc, no puedes poner una jugabilidad tan rápida en ciertos bosses con mucho daño en área en este juego. No es un sekiro o bloodborne, no eres rápido y no da tiempo a esquivar, que si Juan que habrá algún pixel perfect roll para ello pero se os olvida que los souls no son para gente no hit que debe aprender ya no los patrones de siempre si no la única forma de esquivar en x boss en un pixel perfecto y no hay otra manera. En sí este dlc peca y abusa de jefes dinámicos y rápidos que ojo, a mi me gusta muchísimo pero no con este combate de mierda de rodar y pegar de 2009. Estamos a 2024, han salido muchos juegos con sistema de habilidad, rodar, esquiva normal, perfecta, parry, parry perfecto... Y lo gracioso es que muchos de estos juegos se inspiraron en sekiro. Sekiro puede ser la mejor jugabilidad existente y no fueron capaces de añadirlo al elden por los ""soulsbrrruh"" clásicos de rodar y pegar. En fin, en cuanto al daño que mucha gente se queja, es porque efectivamente lo tienen muy mal implementado en este juego ya que se basa en su padre sekiro pero mal, es decir; en vez de como en sekiro que los bosses y/o minibosses te den los fragmentos decidieron dejarlo esparcidos por el mapa y vete tu a saber donde está, necesitas de fuentes externas para buscarlos ya que este dlc está implementado de una forma malísima en mi opinión.",8,2024-06-24,PC,user

yyyynnnn,太牛逼了宫崎英高，你们有没有这样的疯狗dlc啊，真是疯疯又狗狗啊。你们FS也配做游戏吗，这么喜欢调数值干脆以后做氪金手游吧，氪金购买幽影树碎片和灵灰，不买就是boss一刀秒，买了就是一刀秒boss。 说点正经的：1.探索的奖励机制做不好，探索—战斗—奖励是什么很难理解的环节吗，dlc花时间跑岔路下地牢和能两刀把我劈死的怪斗智斗勇然后一看奖励，哈哈，【锻造石1/2/3/4】，【墓地铃兰1/2/3/4】，你猜我需要吗？2.战斗交互纯是一坨，双月骑士疯狗级别的攻击意图，还能根据距离判断派生招式是否出手，真是一代功夫大师收放自如啊，而且不得不承认的是双月的战斗竟然是我打过的boss中体验【数一数二】的了，更不用说其他的了。横向对比一下校长、沙立万、弦一郎、一心、枭，很难评价是什么样的智力障碍能设计出这种毫无交互的逆天战斗。3.终于要说到数值问题，很大程度上这个问题都是由骨灰引起的，稍微玩过一点魂和魂like都能想出来其实boss战很大一部分难度在于他本身是一个1v1的交互环节，突然一方多了一个人拉仇恨/抗伤害，boss战的难度堪称骤降。为了给这个骨灰机制擦屁股，本体后期boss基本都是按照【2v1仍然具有一定难度】这个原则设计的，但是在dlc中几乎所有的中后期boss都可以从数值上碾压玩家+仿生泪滴组合，因此又加入了【幽影庇护】机制给玩家和骨灰数值补正（而且这个补正还只在dlc生效），开始面多加水水多加面，其实更容易的是直接在dlc中禁用骨灰然后正常设计就好了。4.顺便谈谈宫崎英高孝子，打不过就是轮椅人/新玩家/公式复读战技/攻略开荒不会探索/老玩家玩的都很开心 etc. 我只能说你无敌了，继续孝吧,1,2024-06-24,PC,user

TUSK0,"Everything I have wanted it is perfect—the visuals, art design, enemy variety, stunning animations, new weapons, armor, and bosses. There is so much more to do and it is all fantastic. The dlc is hard but not impossible you have a new scaling system exclusive to the dlc, there are followers of Miquella npc summons at every major boss and of course you still have your phantoms. There are so many options to help out if you struggle. I felt I needed to express these points especially, due to the number of negative reviews concerning the difficulty. I have made a fresh character for this dlc prior to its release, a strength build lvl 160 to venture into the lands of shadow and properly scale and experience it, it has been hard yes, harder than most of the base game, as expected for an endgame expansion. The bosses are a wild spectacle with their animations, but it makes sense as to how they fight and who they are, it is intriguing and refreshing, and they feel new and very original. Just like any fromsoft game memorize their movesets and overcome them through trial and error, that is kinda the point, the game has more ways than ever to help aid you on your journey. There are so many people reviewing this game and dlc because of their distain regarding various aspects of it, making irrelevant comparisons, refusing to adapt to the game and meet it on its terms, this is post-endgame content, projecting their preferences and desires as objective fact and proof of its inferior quality. This is nonsense and completely entitled behavior, have respect for the game, what it tries to do, and what it represents, if it isn’t for you it isn’t for you. If Kai can beat the game and dlc solo no summons while being fresh to the franchise maybe you just don’t care enough to try and so these games are just not made for you, so leave it to those who enjoy it and derive meaning from it, rather than trying to present your desires for what you wish it were as if they were genuine points of critique while actively choosing not to understand and adapt to the games presentation, message, and style.

Fanboys of this game streaming this because it's trending and making fake reaction content to steal more and more of your time and money, and they don't give a **** about a good game design. If you disagree with the fanboys they will only scream to you something like ""gid good"" or ""skill issue"" or some other stupid line. What a waste of time and money what an insult to their own legacy. Save your money for a better game.",0,2024-06-23,PC,user

KrispR,"The term “DLC” hardly describes Shadow of the Erdtree. It is massive, and even after nearly 40 hours I have still yet to find everything the DLC has to offer. My only complaint is how relatively easy the side-bosses are. Almost every boss I’ve come across I’ve been able to beat first try, if not my second (though this may just be me). First difficulty spike I faced was (besides the **** hippo) Messmer who was a lot harder then previous bosses and it took me about 2 hours to beat him. The final boss was a huge shock, both because of who it turned out to be and also because the boss’ second-phase is pure, unfiltered, 99.99% pure ****. Took me somewhere between 5-7 hours just to beat the final boss which was quite a difficulty spike compared to the previous bosses. Overall, the weapons are amazing, I didn’t notice any performance issues and I’m sure the bosses were a lot harder for others. I used mimic for most bosses and in the late game where bosses get really hard, mimic stops becoming a crutch and more like a necessity unless you enjoy masochism. I would recommend it for anyone a fan of the base game and it’s bosses, or anyone with 70 hours to kill.",9,2024-06-23,PC,user
GoBudsGo,"Disappointing. Uninspired. Empty lands. Cash grab. These are all what describes FROM software's latest and greatest expansion for their award winning game from early 2022. Nothing has changed over the years and it feels like an old game, as they have given us more of the same. Nothing was added to the base game, so replay value is nonexistent. Bosses are over the top tuned to cheese and destroy you without challenge. Wait for a sale, this is not worth $40, may $5.",0,2024-06-23,PC,user
Zzireael,I'm kinda stuck and dissapointed at final boss ngl... (cuz I was expecting godwyn there) and also I don't know if i could use phantom in this fight or not.

ClarkKunt,"This DLC is basically the Dark Souls of Elden Ring. It's darker, more atmospheric, the story is more interesting, and the level design is absolutely phenomenal. It's not perfect, though. The approach to bosses remains the same as in the second half of the base game: they are way too fast with incredibly long attack chains and almost no openings. Issues with the camera, which are present in every FromSoftware game, are more noticeable than ever. Bosses are big and have an insane number of flashy moves, so it's sometimes hard to even see incoming attacks because it feels like you've been flashbanged. Additionally, everything two-shots you (sometimes even one-shots you), so I understand why people are a little bit pissed about the difficulty. Another issue I have with this DLC is that some areas are clearly unfinished and empty. I encountered a lot of dead ends that were clearly supposed to be places with boss encounters or dungeon entrances. But hey, even with all this in mind, I had a blast and I'm definitely planning to do another playthrough.",8,2024-06-23,PC,user

sprvnkz,I really dig the art style and the amount of content is ridiculous for an expansion but the amount of technical issues and artificial difficulty is killing this game.

winblades,"From Software - world champion for 15 years now, only masterpieces since Demon Souls 2009 and this DLC is no exception.

lorienwarden,"New progression system makes no sense. In Sekiro you get stronger by killing bosses. In souls series and Elden Ring you get stronger by getting souls and leveling stats. In this DLC you search for some seeds in random places on the map. It's also hard to make sense of what those seeds do numerically. What is a good amount to have for an arbitrary point in progression ? Bosses were designed and balanced around jumping str builds. It does make game somewhat harder for them, but also demolishes the fun, more challenging builds from the base game that were utilizing light armor and light weapons. Basically, jumping str builds were upgraded from easy to normal, and light builds from hard to extreme. Plot delivery and quests also strayed away from the signature Fromsoft style. It's much more direct and commanding now. NPCs straight up ask you to go places and even give you maps. Legacy dungeons also feel lackluster compared to the base game. Castles and city-like areas are very small and straightforward. And generally feel rushed and hastily put together. This is the first Fromsoftware work that feels like it has a huge identity crisis. It wants to please the critics that didn't like how quests and plot delivery work in Soulslikes. It took a sharp turn from Souls progression to Sekiro's in the middle **** and managed to get it wrong. It took the most build-diverse soulslike where every build was viable and made it extremely punishing for everyone who enjoyed non-meta builds. I'd only put this DLC above Dark Souls 2 and Demon Souls. Which is crazy, considering how every other Fromsoft DLC was a major improvement for their respective games.",6,2024-06-23,PC,user

As people have said, it's an endgame DLC, but I must say I obliterate nearly all non-boss/mini-boss npcs with couple spells and I've never been one shooted but I have 60vigor. Bosses are challenging because they AOE a lot, but they are not as crazy hard as Malenia though the last one is pretty close due to the big AOE and huge attack power. People should mind their scorpion talismans and level their vigor if they don't want to die, also make good use of all talismans depending on the boss, use good armors and incantations or concoctions to increase defense. Defense is key in this DLC. The dungeons are insanse and the Shadow Fortress is the best dungeon From has ever produced, period. Lore is still confusing as usual, the ending might be a bit underwhelming given the nightmare it was to reach it, but there are some cool relevations. I'm still in awe.",10,2024-06-23,PC,user

While not radically different from the base game, it manages to recapture the magic of playing Elden Ring for the first time.

Blake6291,"After all this years of from software games everytime I just hope that some previous issue would be finally solved or never reused, such as performance issue, camera issue, hit and run bosses, very poor combat system. If you think combat system is great probably you didn't play others action game, try nioh or stellar blade that just came this year. The point is this dlc is full of disappointment for me, I don't care about art direction or how big the maps are, I just have hope they improve the combat system but is always the same boreing hit and run ****. No matters how many type of attacks you have, you will always use one and one only. Boring and very frustrating combat, design for the sake of being difficult, I beat the dlc day 2, i rush through for evading spoilers, I thought to explore the maps after beating main bosses, and so I did, I figured out how very empty and not rewarding the maps were.

Nonsensicalish,"Shadow of the Erdtree is a DLC to go down in the history books. At more than half the size of the base game, there is an argument to be made on this possibly being a standalone game. On top of that, this DLC has many improvements to the general game play. The combat: more fluid, the bosses: more engaging and the exploration: more tight yet vivid. This DLC is increasingly difficult, however items such as the Scadutree blessings and revered spirit ashes tone this down. I would have dropped this to a 9, especially due to performance, but Fromsoft has confirmed a patch to work om this as well as the difficulty.",10,2024-06-22,PC,user
scalebag,"This DLC is the very definition of ""hard for the sake of being hard"" rather than being made with fun in mind. Enemies deal ridiculous amounts of damage, are super aggressive and have some seriously long combos even for regular attacks. Meanwhile, they tend to take very little damage themselves (the bosses especially are absurdly overtuned) and have such high poise that even medium sized enemies barely care that you're hitting them and will just start hitting you right back even if you're in the middle of a combo against them. The new ""level"" mechanic, where you're forced to scour the map for items that will then be used to recover some of your nerfed stats, is extremely poorly implemented. The idea is kinda cool, but each upgrade grants you such a miniscule boost to damage and defense that it barely makes a difference at all no matter how many you find. Imagine if you're trying to protect yourself against a gun shot with a piece of paper and then add layers of paper to the stack every now and then. Sure, the stack will eventually be thick enough to protect you, but until you reach that point, every single shot against you is going to be lethal. That's pretty much what it feels like here. Basically, From Software decided that enemies with more HP and damage equals more challenge, and more challenge always equals more fun. I hate to tell you, but that's not how things work. Rather, what this all has led to is me not even being able to enjoy the exploration part of the game, because I find myself rushing past enemies more often than not simply because fighting isn't worth the huge risk it brings. Elden Ring had some issues but felt fair most of the time, whereas Shadow of the Erdtree is riddled with cheapness and feels nothing but frustrating to play. As a big Souls fan, I can say that it's the low point of the series by a wide margin. As far as I'm concerned, Elden Ring is a complete game and it has no DLC.",0,2024-06-22,PC,user

There is a continuous drip of dopamine around every corner as the world opens up through the progression of the areas. The bosses in the DLC are very challenging.

All directions were used, the map stretches from the extreme north to the extreme south, from top to bottom, there is always more and more to be discovered, and God knows I explored this game too much and there is still more to be found. There are so many bosses, so many enemies, and always in wonderful scenarios that simply enchant you; at no point does the player feel ****'s scary to think about the size of this DLC, but most of all it's scary to think that human beings made this, and not literal Gods, this is, by far the best DLC ever made for a game, and maybe forever will be.",10,2025-01-07,XBOX SERIES X,user

Jeedash,"It's good. A solid DLC and well worth buying if you loved Elden Ring. The combat and art of the game is still s-tier. The difficulty is spot on (no, it's not too hard, even before the nerf). The bosses are mostly fun. And here's the first negative: none of the new bosses gave me a fight that was particularly memorable. Some have interesting mechanics to negotiate, but nothing that rivaled what's in the base game. I also found the open world empty much of the time. You'd walk or ride around and see, fight and find nothing except sheep. They could have halved the size of the map and it wouldn't have affected the game whatsoever. And FromSoft still haven't sorted how the execute NPC quests in an open world context. It's not a deal-breaker but it's a frustration. Related to this is the DLC leveling mechanic. It creates an unnecessary complication particularly when it comes to navigating around the map. The entire region should have the same difficulty. Okay, this may seem like it's a harsh review, but rest assured I really enjoyed my time in the Shadows.

Metanart,"I finished the whole DLC in 3 days - including all secret bosses. And I strongly disagree with the inflated ratings it received. It could be 6 of 7 out of 10, no more. First - in this DLC nothing is being told about Melina or any other characters from the main game. I became a Frenzy lord -and Melina promised to kill me. DLC says nothing about that. The story itself is not good for me. It just exists - I suppose that I missed again some item descriptions to realize genius ideas - but I don't care much - I'm tired of this laziness of FromSoftware. The quests system is the same garbage as before - go somewhere, do smth and maybe you will receive... something. It was fun in Dark Souls - that was some kinda of a feature. It was fine in Lovecraft-like Bloodborne. But for open-world games like Elden Ring, where you're missing a huge part of quests just because you can't find someone or forget about something - because you don't have a proper journal - ooooh, that's not good. All the ""hardness"" of new bosses is in fact that they are faster than the previous ones, and have longer combos. Copy-pasted weapons like katanas from Sekiro or Claws from BB, enemies from Bloodborne - like Winter Lanterns and so on. The overall content of the DLC - you're again just travelling around absolutely empty locations and grabbing some new weapons and a huge stack of COOOKBOOOKS. It's Ubisoft-tier game design - not a game I can enjoy - it's just content I can consume. On Xbox, in performance mode - I'm catching freezes during some boss fights - super nice for the Souls game. The final of the DLC is disappointing - not a proper cutscene, just some ultra-small nothing. I killed almost a god for a minute. And got nothing in the end. Designers are doing good as usual - some locations are quite beautiful. Summary - FMPOV it's quite lazy-crafted DLC and even for fans of Souls I'm not sure that it's worth buying for full price.",0,2024-06-27,XBOX SERIES X,user

HeideKnight,"The trend that started with Elden Ring and that continues now with this expansion that bosses become more and more anime style with long attack combos and flashy moves with visual effects which make it hard to figure out what actually is going on made me not really enjoying playing the DLC. Souls games have become popular because the original games (Demon's Souls and the DarkSouls series) always had a good mixture of bosses with interesting mechanics and sometimes also some environment in the bosse's arena that could be exploited to the player's advantage. Now all one needs to do is to press a single button at the right time and look for attack openings. Of which there are very few ones with most bosses in this DLC. It gets boring and, I would say, even tedious to fight bosses which became more and more complex in their movesets while the player still is restricted to using the dodge mechanics of Dark Souls 1 (with few exceptions including the new jump ability). Fromsoft should not push the Souls series to be an action combat focussed series without adjusting the combat abilities of the player like they did in their action game Sekiro. Instead they should make bosses again which are more adapted to the simple Souls combat mechanics. And this doesn't mean they should decrease the difficulty of the bosses again. Because there are other ways to make a bossfight challenging than to give the bosses only anime moves. I was also hoping that the gameplay density, which is very low due to the huge open world in the base game, would improve in the DLC. But it is even worse now. Many open space areas with nothing interesting to find. I still do not see how a Souls game and an open world exploration game would make a good synergy. In fact, I am missing the spatially restricted levels of Dark Souls where one needs to fight one's way to the next bonfire.",5,2024-06-26,XBOX SERIES X,user

Gam3r0326,"Pros: Exploring dungeons is still the most enjoyable part for me. It’s more Elden Ring. Played on Xbox X. no performance issues. It also works surprisingly well on remote play Yes enemies do a ton of damage but my build also blasted them. Level 184 strength build. Cons: I think the boss fights are not fun and much preferred the base game bosses. It’s just way too much is happening, the camera is all over the place and it’s basically a firework show constantly. However, I was able to blast away most of them fairly easily within 1-4 attempts with lions claw colossal great sword + mimic tear. Except for the final boss who I had to cheese and respec to fingerprint shield and messemer spear to beat. First time I ever respec’d. It also loses the sense of wonder and exploring the base game had. I don’t find the scadutree fragments to be interesting. There’s no transparency in how it impacts the game your just told u need more of them to make the damage more manageable. Overall it’s fun but not as good as the base game.",8,2024-06-24,XBOX SERIES X,user

yyyynnnn,太牛逼了宫崎英高，你们有没有这样的疯狗dlc啊，真是疯疯又狗狗啊。你们FS也配做游戏吗，这么喜欢调数值干脆以后做氪金手游吧，氪金购买幽影树碎片和灵灰，不买就是boss一刀秒，买了就是一刀秒boss。说点正经的：1.探索的奖励机制做不好，探索—战斗—奖励是什么很难理解的环节吗，dlc花时间跑岔路下地牢和能两刀把我劈死的怪斗智斗勇然后一看奖励，哈哈，【锻造石1/2/3/4】，【墓地铃兰1/2/3/4】，你猜我需要吗？2.战斗交互纯是一坨，双月骑士疯狗级别的攻击意图，还能根据距离判断派生招式是否出手，真是一代功夫大师收放自如啊，而且不得不承认的是双月的战斗竟然是我打过的boss中体验【数一数二】的了，更不用说其他的了。横向对比一下校长、沙立万、弦一郎、一心、枭，很难评价是什么样的智力障碍能设计出这种毫无交互的逆天战斗。3.终于要说到数值问题，很大程度上这个问题都是由骨灰引起的，稍微玩过一点魂和魂like都能想出来其实boss战很大一部分难度在于他本身是一个1v1的交互环节，突然一方多了一个人拉仇恨/抗伤害，boss战的难度堪称骤降。为了给这个骨灰机制擦屁股，本体后期boss基本都是按照【2v1仍然具有一定难度】这个原则设计的，但是在dlc中几乎所有的中后期boss都可以从数值上碾压玩家+仿生泪滴组合，因此又加入了【幽影庇护】机制给玩家和骨灰数值补正（而且这个补正还只在dlc生效），开始面多加水水多加面，其实更容易的是直接在dlc中禁用骨灰然后正常设计就好了。4.顺便谈谈宫崎英高孝子，打不过就是轮椅人/新玩家/公式复读战技/攻略开荒不会探索/老玩家玩的都很开心 etc. 我只能说你无敌了，继续孝吧,1,2024-06-24,XBOX SERIES X,user

OMGItsDango,"An honest review, I loved it, it was such a great feeling getting back into Elden Ring, playing the DLC, it was just like playing the base game for the first time, large map and beautiful environments. It was a great experience but I am afraid even though I enjoyed it I did finish the DLC feeling disappointed. The bosses, now the difficulty isn't as bad as people are making them out to be, there are ways to make the DLC easier. However for me they didn't scream base game quality, there is only about 3 bosses out of the main remembrance bosses that I really enjoyed, which personally isn't good enough... The final boss was the biggest disappointment, I for sure thought that there was going to be another fight after it... the boss itself is pretty good but not for the final showdown. The other major red flag for me is the map structure, I love exploring but accessing many of the maps main areas is extremely difficult, infact the game pushes you down the main story line path, I couldn't believe how fast I reached Messmer (trailer boss) By the time I found out the ways to access the other areas there was a few quests that I had been locked out of because I went too far into the main story. Overall the game is fantastic, I enjoyed it but it seems that the base game set the bar too high, I was expecting a little more from Shadow of the Erdtree.",7,2024-06-23,XBOX SERIES X,user

The overworld is big and beautiful, at some points even more beaitiful than in the main game. But mostly it feels like they forgot to program loot. Exploring the whole map doesn't feel as rewarding as in the main game. You can search an area for like 30 Minites without finding anything at several points which is kind of frustrating 2. There are some points so annoying and frustrating they brought me nearly to the point of deleting the game. For example the place were several knighrs are fighting a **** as you're joining this war everyone suddenly forgets this big **** dragon and attacks you. Oviously the dragon, too. So you have two options, you try to fight like 20 Knights, 5 Archer and a dragon at once or you wait for 7 Minutes until the dragon killed everybody before you join the battle. That's peak game ****. But except this 2 little points a can just repeat my review for the main game. It's an breathtaking beautiful and fun experience.

Only a true genius could create something like this, Miyazaki (and his entire team) are to be congratulated for this achievement, Shadow of the Erdtree is a game in itself, if they wanted, they could sell it as a separate game.Every time I thought I had explored the entire map, more and more things appeared, this is an unbelievable level design. All directions were used, the map stretches from the extreme north to the extreme south, from top to bottom, there is always more and more to be discovered, and God knows I explored this game too much and there is still more to be found. There are so many bosses, so many enemies, and always in wonderful scenarios that simply enchant you; at no point does the player feel ****'s scary to think about the size of this DLC, but most of all it's scary to think that human beings made this, and not literal Gods, this is, by far the best DLC ever made for a game, and maybe forever will be.",10,2025-01-07,PLAYSTATION 5,user

nVxx,"Utterly satisfying. Shadow of the Erdtree is a natural and satisfying complement to the original masterpiece. It's also worth mentioning that this is the first (story) DLC I've ever played and was very excited to do so. And of course all of this excitement is grounded in the acceptance of Elden Ring being a masterpiece, despite all the objective and subjective shortcomings. So, if you loved the main game, then Shadow of the Erdtree is a must. Firstly - it's massive, it took me 50+ hours to finish compared to the 200+ of the original game and that's more than enough. I disagree with the complaints about the game's 40$ price tag, since it's still a very dense experience that outshines the value of many full-priced AAA titles actually. Of course, it's smaller than the original, but the original was huge, to the point that after some 160 hours of play I was torn between the itch of exploring every spot I missed and wanting it to be over. While having a smaller map size, the map is much, much more densely packed. The size of the map is similar to Limgrave, but, for one, there is much more verticality, also the points of interest are closer to each other. The only complaint here is that the main game's map layout feels more natural, though this is the Shadow Realm, so maybe that's also on purpose. All in all this helps SotE to conclude on the high note of feeling satisfactory and not overwhelming. The DLC is nicely woven into the main game, both from gameplay and story perspective, as if the story was initially planned with the DLC in mind. Shadow Realms is visually very impressive, and FromSoftware manages once again to deliver the same wow effect when transitioning from the cave to getting the first glimpse of Shadowlands. From the first glance, it's clear that Shadow Realm has its own visual identity. Not only through its locations but also primarily through its visual style. You could easily guess from a screenshot whether it's Shadow Realm or Lands Between. That said, I should admit that it's not as visually striking as some of the main game locations, but that's partly because the main game had the advantage of this first wow effect. Some aspects I didn't care about were the new combat styles and weapons. I ended up playing the whole game with my main-game character and build, only occasionally switching to the new stronger talismans and armors from DLC. Speculating about a possible Elden Ring 2, SotE maybe wouldn't cut it, but it's more than one can expect for a DLC.",10,2024-12-30,PLAYSTATION 5,user

CnPx98,"I know everyone will say it's good, just cos it's from software. However it's ok. However, enemies just felt more like eye candy, instead of stuff that's fun to fight. Every boss needs all these flashing effects going on, then you take tons of damage at some random time. Your not learning the times from the animations, your learning them by counting how long from the moment the attack starts. Yes I completed the DLC before writing this. But this new direction FS are going in where they are constantly trying to 1 up themselves by making things more extreme, just isn't for me. Malenia **** in the base game. I didn't want to fight several more similar bosses. I love hard bosses. Why else would I play these games. But when you have no idea what's even going on cos of the exaggerated effects, just feels tedious to learn. I still prefer Dark Souls 1. Encounters were just overall more thought through, and boss attacks were easy to pick-up and understand. Not a bunch of disco light. Oh yh. If you enjoy your 60 fps in the base game. Your gonna love the constant stutters in the DLC. The moment you enter the DLC, despite the area having less stuff going on, your frame rate is all over the place. Still no performance fix patch as of 26th November 2024. I normally don't care about Unreal Engine. However I think they need to finally switch. Lies of P is a clear example that these games just work better on UE. From software games on PC, always feel terrible compared to consoles. Apperantly it doesn't pre compile shaders on PC?? The DLC does look nice. Area can be fun to explore. Some enemy types and weapons were fun. They just dropped the ball on the bosses.

Zonas deslumbrantes en su apartado artístico, nuevas mazmorras plagadas de secretos (a veces muy enrevesados) y detalles, enemigos desafiantes nuevos y bosses a la altura de la grandeza del juego original. La dificultad es bastante alta pero no injusta y se ofrece un mayor abanico de posibilidades con nuevas armas, hechizos, etc. El lore añadido es muy interesante y resuelve muchas dudas que quedaron en el aire en el juego base. Solo puedo sacar un punto negativo realmente reseñable: lo exageradamente vasto que es. A la repetición de bosses que nos acostumbró ya el juego base se le añaden las aspiraciones de hacer un mapa gigantesco, lo que ha provocado que muchas zonas del mapa estén muy vacías y, exceptuando su arte, no hay nada que me incite visitarlas. Esto es un problema que no se puede ignorar y que ha perjudicado mi experiencia de juego.

SimoAlpha,"What to say? The best videogame expansion ever until now. It can provide, for the first run, like 40-50 high quality hours. The world design is improved from the base game, and the Shadow Realm remembers Lordran for its complexity and the number of interconnections. The DLC pushes you to explore carefully, because some entire sections with important bosses are very well hidden behind dungeons or even fake walls. The boss fights are incredibly stunning and choreographic, even though some are a bit problematic, like “dirty” in moveset, with moves difficult to predict. The difficulty is pretty high, but if you know how to exploit what the game offers, it can become a lot easier (there are of course OP weapons, incantations and summons). The narration is clear and also more explicit than expected, the NPCs are quite numerous and their quests easy to understand (with some exceptions, sadly). If you liked Elden Ring, you can’t miss the DLC.",10,2024-11-09,PLAYSTATION 5,user

In general, everything as always at the appropriate level, the developers are good!Yes, as it seemed to me, screwed up the complexity on some bosses. Yes, and in general there were mobs that with two blows took out me. But I overcame it all! The game is very satisfied. In addition, they revealed even more detailed plot, which can not but please.

I was wary about getting it prior to release (mainly because of the price tag), but after seeing that people thought it was worth it, I finally bit the bullet. I wish I didn't. The whole map is too winding and confusing, with basically nothing in it. New weapons I found were worthless or unable to be used with my build (I guess we're all big fans of INT+FTH in this DLC, huh), bosses felt uninspired or just the same unbalanced junk that has plagued FS games forever (i.e. big enemy that hops around in large room), even mini dungeons with no bosses at the end. My build used a lot of Vigor and heavy armour, plus a shield; I still got melted in two hits by most things. After some hours it started to feel like a chore and I just wasn't having fun anymore. I like hard games, I like challenging myself. This doesn't feel like that. Couldn't even be bothered to finish it. I loved the base game and played it a few times. That won't be happening with this.

DarkMadison,"I’m a huge Fromsoftware fan who has a platinum trophy in all their games. All those games starting with Demon Souls are masterpieces to me. I preordered Shadow of the Erdtree and was counting minutes to start playing the most anticipated DLC EVER. At first, the game looked a top notch but over the course of time, I started noticing numerous flaws of the game. Good sides of the DLC: 1) Some visuals and bosses design are impressive. Disappointments: 1) No trophies 2) Unfair difficulty and constant one shots. The game tries everything possible to make me fight a boss as long as possible to prolong the DLC duration. The bosses are too aggressive, leaving me frustrated after beating them. 3) Poor exploration. The vanilla game caught my attention immediately. There was always something interesting to find, upgrades, weapons, golden seeds. There was a sense of wonder to puzzle out every secret the game has. The majority of DLC is absolutely empty. 4) Poor rewards. After riding empty fields for 30 minutes, the best reward the game can provide is another cookbook. 5) Extremely boring dungeons. Even though many criticized the main game dungeons, I found them pretty interesting to explore with many secrets and chilling bosses at the end. Here many dungeons not only don’t provide anything interesting, but some dungeons even don’t have a boss. 6) Overly interconnected world which feels unpleasant and tedious to explore. All in all, Fromsoftrare has delivered the worst DLC. The game feels completely unfair and not engaging at all. To play SotE is a monotonous job unlikely FS games.

LordBarco,"ELDEN RING - SHADOW OF THE ERDTREE REVIEW FromSoftware is now the most lauded developer when it comes to action online RPGs, and their Soulslike formula seems to be thriving for some specific type of gamers: Hardcore gamers, but for casual fans, their difficult games have now become a nuisance as you need hundreds of hours to become a master and finish a fight with a specific enemy, most likely bosses, and in the end that sense of accomplishment is simply devoid of joy as these games, at least for me, have now become boring, when they should be praised for the many other aspects SETTING You can get here after you defeated Mogh the Lord of Blood (one of the toughest bosses in the game, mind you) and you will be transported to the Land of Shadow, where you need to uncover the secrets of Miquela. Pretty straight FromSoftware stuff. MECHANICS • Combat: remains the same as the base game with the introduction of new weapons and skills. But now the difficulty has been increased as even if you are overleveled in the base game, you need to collect specific items in this world to become strong enough. Yes, enemies will kill you with 1 it or 2 hits. Ludicrous, but if you liked the base game, you would like this expansion. Bosses are harder than the base game, and the idiocy of repeating this boring cycle of death and coming back is not rewarding at all, as bosses won’t yield anything good for you to feel you are progressing your character. • Exploration: the best aspect of this game. FromSoftware has become better and better at designing and developing complex intricate worlds. The world design of the Lands of Shadow is one of the best I have seen in any other video game. Exploring this world is the best aspect of the game.VISUALSTheir engine is now becoming old, you can see it. Although the game is a visual marvel, it does not compare with other titles, like God of War. Still, the graphics are very good, dark, grimy, and that sense of unwholesomeness is ever present. The staple of FromSoftware. SOUNDS & MUSIC Great! The new OST for this game is good and it will immerse you more in the exploration. The sounds and music are very well put and even with the frustration of the boss battles, you will enjoy the musical score. FINAL THOUGHTSA good game which best aspect is exploration. I could buy 100 games like this for the sole purpose of doing exploration and not engaging in combat at all. This game suffers from the same boredom that FromSoftware is characterized, and that is becoming old. Gamers seem to like this, I don’t, as I do not have hundreds of hours to dedicate myself to a single game. A shame, as this could have been a wondrous adventure. No more for me with FromSoftware unless they put difficulty levels. If you like your butt being kicked, go for it, buy it, but if you play for the joy of relaxing… STAY AWAY FROM THIS NIGHTMARE!",4,2024-08-25,PLAYSTATION 5,user
MacMo,"In terms of graphics, scope and creativity, it's probably the best thing I've ever seen in a DLC. But now comes the big but, I had really massive problems defeating bosses and often got stuck because the difficulty in this DLC is absolutely exaggerated. Incidentally, I say this as a big From Software fan who has played and played through all the games so far, I have never experienced anything like this DLC. Of course you can stop with any builds but is that the purpose of the game?

FromSoftware is one of the best studios in history and Elden Ring in particular was able to showcase this, despite the minor criticisms of the main game! My problem with SotE is simply that I expected a DLC like The Old Hunters, a flawless masterpiece for a game like Elden Ring and these expectations were not met in any way. The bosses have too little character (e.g. cutscenes) and are often poorly animated/designed, as are the weapons, for example. Only a few bosses like Bayle, Midra, Dancing Lion or Messmer meet the huge expectations of a FromSoftware Elden Ring DLC, although I'm sure that the fault lies with Sony, a company that ultimately cannot compete with a studio like FromSoftware, which makes an extreme effort to stand out through quality, as we already had with Dark Souls! So why the good rating? To counteract the extremely subjective, unfair evaluations of frustrated people! I am sure that FromSoftware is not the only one to blame for the problems of SotE, which objectively are not as serious as they are described!",10,2024-08-04,PLAYSTATION 5,user

MetaBones,"As an expansion, this might be the most ambitious and well-worth DLC that's been made. It has so many hours of quality content with incredible places to explore, fun and challenging bosses to fight, and interesting lore that expands on the base game in meaningful ways. I'm truly happy with buying it and it really fills in Elden Ring into a complete fantasy RPG experience. That being said, I do have criticms. First one, difficulty. I've played through every ince of Elden Ring base game as well as Dark Souls and Bloodborne and I can say that the difficulty with some of these bosses (two in particular) are designed so brutal, it's not balanced and fair in any least bit. I had to resort to a completely different build that required no skill just to complete the last boss and I know I will never fight him again. Second, exploration is haulted at so many turns due to it's lack of interconnectivity (something FromSoftware is known for). Traversing to different locations and pieces of the maps require way too obscure methods to get there and these paths are just too hidden that looking up guides just to see where to go to progress is frustrating. Third, fire furnace golems. Done The game truly is incredible and it is a high-quality piece of DLC that is very much worth the price tag but the extreme difficulty, obscure and confusing traversal, and unfun enemies do make me concerned about their future with the next games. I hope the right lessons are taken from this DLC.",8,2024-08-02,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Redrex456,"A fantastic DLC to a great game. The world building, art direction, level design, and boss design are all top notch. Just like the base game, the world here is full of jaw dropping locations that will take your breath away. The gargantuan scale of many of the areas is matched by the brilliant level design which emphasizes verticality and rewards exploring off the beaten path through hidden entrances to new areas that can only be accessed as a result of thorough exploration. Shadow Keep in particular is one of the most spectacular levels I have ever seen in a video game with its foreboding visual design, masterful use of environmental storytelling, and sprawling non linearity. The only criticism I could make of the world design is that the methods to access certain areas sometimes feel too far off the beaten path to the point where they are way too unintuitive for the player to find on their own without looking up a guide. The overall boss roster in this DLC is exceptional. While there are certainly some stinker bosses which are not at all fun to learn, most of the main story bosses are among the finest of any of FromSoft’s work. Many of them have great build up through the levels preceding them, a learning curve that is very steep but fair for the player to get better at, and unforgettable visual spectacle that is incredible to behold. I would also be remiss if I didn’t make mention of the absolutely phenomenal soundtrack for the boss fights that does wonders to heighten the adrenaline fueled intensity of many of the boss encounters. The boss fights are also complimented well by the various new effective weapons, Ashes of War, and Talismans which give the player many viable options to deal with the at times overwhelming challenge posed by the boss fights. Overall, if you enjoyed Elden Ring’s base game, you will undoubtedly love this DLC. It has taken everything great about the base game and amplified it to 11.

LGTSwords,"Elden Ring Review: An Epic Journey with Some Painful Pitfalls Introduction: FromSoftware's Elden Ring has been a monumental release, blending their signature dark fantasy with an expansive open world. This game offers a deeply immersive experience, though not without its flaws. Here’s a deep dive into what makes Elden Ring stand out and where it stumbles. The Good: 1. Wholesome Character Building:One of Elden Ring's standout features is its flexible and engaging character-building system. Whether you prefer a stealthy assassin, a mighty warrior, or a mystical sorcerer, the game caters to a variety of playstyles. The diversity in builds ensures that players can experiment with different strategies, each offering a unique and entertaining approach to combat and exploration. 2. Insane Replayability:Elden Ring excels in replayability. Starting over with a new character feels like stepping into a completely different game. Each build provides a fresh experience, making it easy to get lost in the game world time and time again. This aspect is a testament to the game’s depth and the developers’ commitment to creating a dynamic and engaging experience. 3. Exceptional World Building:The game’s world is a marvel of design and creativity. FromSoftware has crafted a vast and intricately detailed landscape that feels alive and brimming with secrets. Every corner of the map invites exploration, rewarding players with stunning vistas and hidden treasures. 4. Immersive Lore:The lore of Elden Ring is both captivating and deeply woven into the game’s fabric. Instead of straightforward exposition, the story unfolds through environmental storytelling, item descriptions, and fragmented lore scattered throughout the world. This approach enhances immersion, encouraging players to piece together the narrative on their own and adding layers to their journey. The Bad: 1. Overly Aggressive Bosses in the DLC:While the base game offers a challenging but fair experience, the DLC introduces bosses with hyper-aggressive tactics and fewer openings for punishment. This shift can make certain builds less viable and significantly increases the difficulty. Although these bosses are beatable, the frustration they can induce may detract from the enjoyment for some players. 2. Frustrating World Building in the DLC:The DLC’s world building, while impressive at times, can become a labyrinthine challenge. Discovering content and progressing through the DLC often requires external guides, as some crucial story elements and bosses are hidden behind obscure paths. This can be a barrier to immersion and might hinder players who prefer a more intuitive exploration experience. 3. Awful Final Boss Design:The final boss of Elden Ring is a significant letdown, embodying many of the game’s worst design aspects. This boss encounter is marred by poor design choices, including an inadequately adapted camera system that struggles to handle both large and small enemies. The result is a frustrating battle that can overshadow the otherwise impressive experience of the game. Conclusion: Elden Ring is an extraordinary achievement in game design, offering unparalleled depth in character customization, replayability, and world-building. Its lore, told through a compelling and immersive narrative, adds an extra layer of intrigue. However, the DLC’s design introduces elements that can be both frustrating and challenging, and the final boss encounter falls short of the game’s high standards. Despite these drawbacks, Elden Ring remains a must-play title for fans of the genre, delivering a rich and memorable adventure with its share of epic triumphs and notable missteps.",9,2024-07-25,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Fubuism,"2 years after finishing elden ring I returned as a tarnished again for this epic adventure. Fromsoft are brilliant, they found a way to level the playing fields between who finished the base game once and those who capped their levels and stats. Shadow of erdtree is smaller than base game, so everything is more condensed and thrilling, enemies are lethal if you are not careful, many secret areas and the bosses are quite a challenge even for a fromsoftwaregame. my wife, who's not really into games, was just chilling next to me while I was battling Rellana and the lion amd she was having a blast. It was so intense and thrilling, and I had a blast fighting those bosses.

The world map doesn’t help either, the current system not supporting areas with multiple layers of verticality.

The bosses just are not fun to fight in most instances.",6,2024-07-19,PLAYSTATION 5,user
Abraham15,"I think this is hands down the best downloadable content/DLC I've ever seen. It has a slightly high price, I bought it initially for €40 which could be the price of a complete video game, but if you like Elden Ring I think it is worth it. It provides many hours of gameplay between weapons, summons, armor, enemies and story. The map is massive and the design of the levels and the map itself is very well done, as always. Maybe the DLC ends a little abruptly, I would have preferred another ending, but it is what it is. There are a lot of areas of the map that are a little empty, but they are empty compared to the base game, and I don't think they are empty, but rather the DLC has a different design. I think they wanted the areas of the map to be much more open and clear instead of narrow and full of things to discover. I think it is not a lack of content by any means, but a change in the design, also to differentiate it from the base **** my opinion, the DLC is perfect as it is, a masterpiece that, together with the base game, becomes an essential part of the history of video games.",10,2024-07-19,PLAYSTATION 5,user
D3NGZ,"this DLC is so great and packed with some of the best FROM SOFTWARE work ever downvoting it because its "" too hard "" is idiotic.. its supposed to be harder than the main Elden Ring game. to be put it simply it enhances the main game in the best way possible. Pros: + the most incredible level design i have ever seen, everything is so vertical and DENSE. + the art design is light years ahead of other game in the shadow realm. + The Soundtrack is of highest quality and really memorable. + The new zones and Dungeons are even better now with how deep they go, the Shadow Keep branches out so much its mind boggling. + The New Story & Lore really give us alot of answers and help improve the main game story. + many added talismans, weapons, spells, incantations, armor sets and various new secrets to find. + the map itself it is gorgeous and a joy to explore. + new Bosses and enemies are again top quality and are fun to take down. + New characters are interesting and have fairly detailed side quests that blends into the main one. Cons: - some performance issues during the last boss and sometimes slight fps drops while exploration. - expected more shown from the final cutscene personally. in closing : its a Jaw dropping expansion to and already all time great game and every person who liked Elden Ring should play it.",10,2024-07-19,PLAYSTATION 5,user

NestorMakhno,"This is addressed to Fromsoftware: Please, just a remake of Bloodborne. Don't touch Bloodborne otherwise. We (and by ""we"" I mean ""I"" ) don't need a Bloodborne 2 with the current design direction Extremely unfun bosses, copypasted general characteristics with just the animations to differentiate one from another. The description ""High Health, High Damage, Immune to stagger, Huge posture bars, long combos, constant aoe attacks, very short windup animations OR extremely delayed attacks (no middle ground ) , attacking through blinding effects"" applies to a great number of them. I could be literally describing any one of more than ten bosses. You are replaying the same idea over and over and over, and only differentiate animations. Please, please, never return to Bloodborne. Just a remake of the original masterpiece will suffice. Your design has failed. Spectacularly. Edit: This is addressed to potential customers. I am now at my 6th playthrough of the DLC My rating began at... I believe 4/10 The more I experience this DLC and understand better the conscious design decisions of the studio in the making of the bosses, the more my rating fell. It can go no lower at this point. This is definitely the last time I preorder anything fromsoftware. This product is just excrement (comparing it to the standards this company has set for itself).

Here, there's only frustration, and even when you manage to beat an enemy, there's no satisfaction, just frustration. You beat them more by chance or misunderstanding than by skill. Maybe I'm bad at the game or maybe the bosses are too overpowered. I didn't enjoy it this time. I don't think the balancing is good. I've always managed to overcome every stage in a game by persevering, but this is too much. The final boss is unplayable, even when maxed out with all blessings, it's unplayable, one **** my opinion, a game shouldn't be this frustrating.

Conseguiu ser pior do que o jogo principal; - A história da DLC em si é mais confusa do que o padrão da Fromsoftware. Totalmente me desinteressei pela história; - E o pior defeito: os Bosses principais. Todos voam, super rápidos, arenas gigantes, stamina infinita e esponja de HP. Praticamente colocaram chefes de Sekiro num jogo Souls, a disparidade de velocidade é absurda, uma dificuldade artificial preguiçosa.

While some bosses can be punishing with notoriously flashy moves, this does not detract against the overall experience as the increased variety of tools and enhancements at your disposal is more than enough to overcome them.

ericiidx,"Maybe I'm just burnt out on the formula -- I've been a big fan since Demon's Souls -- but I struggled to enjoy my time with this DLC. It slots into the base game perhaps a bit too well, in that it's chock full of huge grassy fields of nameless tombstones and ghostly enemies, and not much else. I couldn't help but feel reminded about how the final few areas of the base game ran out of steam (excluding Miquella's Haligtree, which was excellent.) The general level design is frustratingly vertical, but the vistas are still as beautiful as they ever were. The new leveling mechanic, which only applies within the confines of the DLC area, was immediately a turnoff. I did enjoy 2 or 3 of the new bosses, and vehemently disliked the rest (including the final boss, who was a pretty big letdown for a number of reasons.) Only one of them really stuck with me as a quality encounter with genuine difficulty that rewards your perseverance (if you've been watching the pre-release trailers, you can probably guess who I'm talking about.) Otherwise, they are either boring pushovers or horribly over-tuned for the sake of... what? So people on social media will opine about how soooo hard the game is? So you feel you got your money's worth? Without spoiling anything, I found most of the bosses extremely uninteresting, visually and thematically -- some of the weakest, laziest encounters in the entire Soulsborne catalog. It pains me to think that this DLC was just a huge cash grab; finally a ding to my steel-clad confidence in Fromsoft games/expansions. I await their next game with bated breath -- ""automatic pre-order"" is indefinitely off the table. Be prepared for lots of reskins, dragons (always a real treat!), and Mimic Tear lookalikes... and there are a whole lot of them here. ""Quantity over quality"" a la Dark Souls 2 comes to mind. The Bloodstarved Beast model from Bloodborne even makes a cameo to help pad the boss count. Ultimately, I think this is a good way to assess whether or not you should buy this: did you finish the base game and feel hungry for more of the same? If so, buy this. Did you excitedly trek all the way through Bloodborne's 60 million chalice dungeons to Queen Yharnam, smiling all along the way as you fought boring reskin boss after boring reskin boss? You're gonna love it. If you felt satisfied finishing the base game with little to no desire to revisit it, hard pass.",4,2024-07-10,PLAYSTATION 5,user

bckiwinz,"I have never been great at Souls games, and inevitably I fell off them at some point. However, I loved Elden Ring as I could do the work and over level. I platinumed the game, and finished on Game plus 3 in order to get all the endings. Now with the DLC my over-leveling counts for very little, and I have the additional difficulty of the Games Plus 3. And further upgrading is finite based on a treasure hunt. Solution? removed the difficulty penalty that comes with Game plus. The game plus difficulty increase was to balance the over leveling that came with each play through. Removing only the over leveling benefit makes the game unbalanced",5,2024-07-08,PLAYSTATION 5,user
Bittelille,"Very disappointed in this DLC. As a big soulsborne fan I had high hopes for this release as Fromsoft usually delivers big time with their DLC content, but unfortunately this time was different. Shadow of the Erdtree suffers from a lot of the same flaws as the main game, but to me they seem even more apparent in the DLC. The bosses are poorly designed, so much so a lot of them weren’t even remotely fun to fight. The difficulty makes their design flaws outright impossible to ignore, as you’ll likely have to spend a lot of time fighting some of them (which would have been completely fine if the boss fights felt polished and engaging.) The map is again too big for it’s own good, as several areas feel empty and unfinished, and there’s still far too much reused content. The map design itself is great, but exploring no longer feels as rewarding, as you mostly just find stuff you don’t need. You’re likely to depend way too much on google to find certain areas and bosses, to the point were it doesn’t feel like I’m playing the game the intended way. I was never a fan of the combat style of Elden Ring in the first place, and the way these bosses just put on a show rather than giving you a proper learning experience and a proper fight, just feels slightly annoying at best, and outright ridiculous at worst. They’ve managed to do this right plenty of times before, which is why this feels so frustrating to me. A high difficulty does not equal good content, even for a game series that’s known for its difficulty. If they ever decide to make another soulsborne game, I really hope they give the bosses the same love and attention as they did in bloodborne and sekiro. This just ain’t it.",3,2024-07-07,PLAYSTATION 5,user
ClamDaniel,"Like many fans, I've played every ""Soulsborne"" game and DLC. This is the first content that I am on the fence about recommending to fans. Shadow of the Erdtree has a few of the most interesting/spectacular environments of all the games, but it also has the worst boss designs. There were exactly 3 bosses that I thought were fun and worth learning, and that I would consider trying to beat various NG+s.

Luifilth,"Jogo excelente, maravilhoso, muito gostoso de jogar. Mas infelizmente perdi a vontade de continuar. Estou no último boss e o desafio é totalmente bizarro, não há outra palavra para definir aquela aberração, parece que hoje em dia o objetivo dos desenvolvedores é fazer jogos cada vez mais difíceis e deixar de lado a diversão. Podem dizer o que quiserem mas aquele último boss não é justo nem um pouco, passei por todos os outros, sem maiores dificuldades, não digo que foi fácil, mas pelo menos foi justo, até mesmo o gaius, que é o pior boss que já tiveram a capacidade de criar, mas ainda assim foi uma luta justa. E eu não vejo como isso pode satisfazer as pessoas, vejo videos no youtube de pessoas extremamente estressadas por causa do jogo, tudo bem que se sentem aliviadas e até felizes depois que passam um desafio, mas a quantidade de sofrimento que têm que passar para se alcançar esse objetivo é gigante. Eu falo por mim mesmo, quando a dificuldade é exagerada como é o caso desse último boss, eu não sinto nem um pingo de prazer ou satisfação em completar o objetivo, morrer 100, 200, 300 vezes para um boss não é o que eu consideraria diversão. Acredito que os desenvolvedores deveriam repensar seus conceitos e talvez se lembrem que games foram inventados para distrair, dar prazer e alegria, na minha opinião esqueceram completamente o que é isso. E digo mais, posso até tentar finalizar o jogo, se o fizer, quero tentar sem driblar a dificuldade do jogo, sem usar glitchs, invocações, magias, magos... pois jogo apenas com um tipo de build sempre, dex e não vou usar nada além das cinzas de guerra para vencer, mas podem ter certeza que nunca mais jogo ele e com toda certeza não vou me sentir nem um pouco feliz, ele apenas vai entrar para minha lista de jogos que finalizei, o jogo base era e foi justo, a dlc com seu boss final não tem nada de justiça. Tenho 40 anos e estou velho demais para ficar me estressando com uma coisa que deveria me proporcionar bem estar e satisfação. Ps: as lutas contra a Rellana e o Messmer, além de serem justas foram as melhores lutas da dlc, mesmo com algumas hit box toscas. A movimentação dos dois é maravilhosa, uma das coisas que mais me impressionaram em elden ring foi a movimentação, muitas vezes é simplesmente maravilhoso ver a fluidez de movimentos.

Khrist75,"Very disappointed by this DLC... The level design is poor/clunky compared to its magnificient ancestor, there are too many bosses without any lore/explanation of what they're doing here. But the worst aspects for me are this empty/dull spaces with no point of interest. I've waited for it so long and i don't think i will finish it though...

arcboy,"An absolute masterpiece. In my opinion the level design in this DLC surpasses the base game by far, and might even be From’s best level design to date. The way the different areas utilize verticality is truly awe inspiring. Crossing a bridge on the highest mountains peaks and looking down to the deep depths below, only to be down in the depths later looking up at the tiny shadow of that same bridge way up above being swallowed by the sunlight above it. The smaller dungeons in the DLC feel like they have so much more purpose than in the base game, all with their own unique theming and feeling of history in the world. The new enemy and boss designs are awesome, and some of the bosses were really tough. Some reused enemy designs (looking at you ulcerated tree spirit) but the amount of cool and new enemies makes me not even care. New weapon types are really fun to use, some need some balancing but most are really cool, as well as all the new AOWs. Just overall an absolute incredible experience and I couldn’t have asked for more. From Software nailed it again. 10/10",10,2024-07-04,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Buti don't know why, as soon as I entered the dlc something changed, I was very invested in exploring this grim yet beautiful land of the shadows. Not only that, but I had a lot of fun with the bosses, especially the final one, and beating them just felt as satisfying as back in the day when I was playing Dark Souls 3 or Bloodborne.

I'm not great at this and have over leveled to help me, an amazing aspect of the original game. Now I'm stuck, I apparently need to collect arbitrary McGuffins to regain my ability to survive. Found a knight guy whos killed me 30 times and I'm going to lose my souls, I was like 20k from a level and at lvl 195 that's a good bit. I'm just really frustrated and since I cant gain xp to be able to handle stronger mobs, I'm going to have to look up a guide to be able to progress. I don't like how its set up and I cant get into it because all I've managed to do is hit wall after wall. A lot of the good aspects of the progression from the main game are simply gone because of the change. Now its just up a weapons o max and either wear armor or not. The effects from the arbitrary McGuffins are all that matter, and I don't even understand how to find them without a guide. its so much work only get stuck figuring out how to, figure out how to progress.

Well this is the umpteenth From Software game and all players able to access the DLC have already reached a high level on the original game so what's the matter here guys ?! You forgot this game is challenging ?! Cause after personally being gone through it I can state there's no such difference between base game and DLC when it comes to difficulty, same exact hassle against bosses as well as throughout each single area. Seems like playing other games in two years made players accustomed to a lower difficulty and thereby intolerant to FromSoft standard... What the heck ! This said this DLC is in my point of view the simple continuity of the original game but with some more verticality, all praises already declaimed two years ago still stand, next step for the company would be to possibly improve online and coop play ? Being able to play it like a Sekiro game as well ? Or any other fancy and great idea Miazaki has been able to bring to this incredible software company.

The fact is, Shadow of the Erdtree is designed poorly. Bosses have mechanics that are not fun to deal with, like frame perfect dodging and camera issues. Developer's solution is to add little yellow McGuffins over the area that make the game playable again. It's lazy and uninspired. Exploration is strong, but when it's required to progress, it feels different. Kind of like someone putting your favorite meal in front of you and then saying, ""You better eat this, or else..."".

The SF mechanic is lazy and the final boss is a test of RNG and repeated dodging just to get the chance for one attack every 15-20 seconds. FromSoftware is still one of my favorite developers.

laughlinzach,"Pretty great expansion when comparing to other games add-ons. Here are my thoughts: Bosses: 8/10. Some are my favorite of the whole series, including Messmer, Midra, and the final boss. Of course, each of these are humanoid bosses with parry windows making for interactive fights. The bigger bosses / non humans are what you've come to expect, e.g., awful camera and lock-on systems. Level Design: 7/10 - I think the level design is good and reminiscent of dark souls one. There's so many areas that are a puzzle to even get into, which makes finding them even better. However, it's not as cohesive as you'd expect. There's a lot of open fields and filler areas with nothing, no bosses, no rewards, just empty space. A tighter world-map would have been better. Bigger isn't always better. Systems: 6/10 - I appreciate the forethought into the Scadu Tree fragment system, but it felt completely unnecessary. Why not just use base leveling mechanics like the original game? You wind up either under-performing or over-performing based on your fragment level. But most importantly, if all you care about are boss fights, then finding these fragments are tedious and slow down your progress.",7,2024-07-02,PLAYSTATION 5,user

FromSoft dlcs have always been the best material of the game and this trend continues here to probably the biggest jump in quality.

Unfortunately, passed the few main dungeons of this DLC, there's not much to do, there's too much empty spaces. There's some dungeons that are better in design than the legacy dungeons from base game but there's definitely a lack of those. There's a total of 10 main bosses, two of them are great, the rest is meh. Special mention for the final boss that is controversial atm, and the ending... Well, it felt like a scam to me. You beat the final boss who's far from easy and... Nothing ? Why ? I don't get it. The new movesets are cool if you're into PvP, some weapons are just broken for PvE too. Overall, new weapons and armors are totally legit. Now about performance... It's worst than the base game and it doesn't serve the game at all, some bosses require perfect timing to dodge specific attacks and frame rate drop at those specific time, every time.

ZidaneMina,"There have been many complaints regarding this DLC difficulty, however, even if it is indeed hard, the DLC itself gives the player a huge variety of tools and items to make the journey a lot easer. The Scadutree Blessing system it's quite genious, as it levels the playing field to an equal ground to every player regardless of their level. Not leveling up Scadutree Blessing would make the journey incredibly and unnecesarily hard. The bosses themselves, regarding their difficulty are quite well designed, with some minor faults here and there (Like Commander Gaius hit boxes, or FINAL BOSS blinding effects),each fault that can be resolved via a patch. I do not think any boss deserves a nerf, not even the final one. You'll need to change your strat and build to make things easer, get out of your comfort zone, pride only will make you suffer. The exploration it's amazing and the legacy dungeons a sight to behold. This feels like an entirely new game and only makes an already incredible game into one of a legend.

barillas,"The fanbase of this game needs to learn how to handle criticism. Any negative comment about the game is taken personally, as if FromSoftware were a religion. The bosses in this DLC suffer from the same issues as those in the base game, and it's quite frustrating. They spam AoE attacks with excessive visual effects, making it hard to see where to focus. This over-reliance on flashy effects detracts from the gameplay experience, as it becomes more about managing visual clutter than actual skillful combat.Moreover, many bosses feel like recycled versions of each other, with minimal novelty beyond their visuals. It's disappointing to encounter boss after boss that, despite looking different, essentially follows the same attack patterns and strategies. This lack of variety makes the encounters feel repetitive and uninspired. Simply giving a boss almost infinite health is not good game design; it turns battles into tedious endurance tests rather than engaging challenges. A well-designed boss should require players to adapt and strategize, not just chip away at an enormous health bar. The emphasis should be on innovative mechanics and rewarding skillful play, rather than relying on inflated difficulty through health pools and visual bombardment. It's time for fans to recognize these flaws and demand better from the developers.

The one area that could be improved is the map system and navigation, at times is really difficult to work out how to access certain areas which will lead to a lot of people missing significant content.

akalban,"The game mechanics of Scadutree Blessing breaks everything you invested in the character you built in the base game. FYI, I reached the final Boss of this DLC, and the difficulty spikes way to high and not logical. I finished all bosses except the Final Boss. Currently the stats caps are unknown, so the character you built over 2 years need to need tweeked all the time; Even-though the DLC give you a boost in stats, everything is canceled with way the world deals damage to the character. The speed of the the world, and the damage is designed to make most gamers uncomfortable, and that's why steam reviews are mixed. the game design is flawed. I wonder whats the dev goal with this DLC. The DLC has an amazing world building, animation, soundtrack and lore. However the devs failed to deliver a good gaming experience.",4,2024-06-28,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Smacking head-first into a brick wall that demands you adapt, improve, explore the new world, and discover new ways to overcome. The genius of this low-key sequel cannot be overstated. Some of the coolest weapons, spells, armors, equipment and movesets of any souls-like game to date. All purposefully placed around a massive, pretty new world in proper Elden Ring fashion.

ErayTellezi,"35 saat ve tam 200 level ile tüm ana ve yan boss'ları keserek bitirdim. Bu DLC değil, Elden Ring 2. Çünkü bir dlc'ye göre delice bir iş. 30-40 saatlik bir oynanış sunuyor ve her anına değiyor. Yeni haritalar, yeni düşmanlar, yeni boss'lar, silahlar ve büyülerle ana oyunun üstüne koyulmuş. Ve bir Fromsoftware klasiği olarak ana oyundan daha zor olduğu söyleniyor. Ama bana ana oyundan daha zor gelmedi doğrusu. Tabii ben her savaşta yanıma hayalet (mimic değil) çağırdığım için de olabilir. Ama eskiden de çağırıyordum. Bence asıl neden birçok insan souls türüne Elden Ring'le girdi. ER ise diğer souls'lara göre daha kolay veya daha fazla oyunu kolaylaştırma yöntemi sunan bir oyun. DLC ile souls türü zorluğuna dönülmüş biraz daha. Sadece ER oynayanların ağlaması bu yüzden, alışırlar. Ana oyunda uzunca bir şeyler yazığım için fazla ekleyecek bir şeyim yok. Boss'lar daha kıvrak, hareketleri daha tahmin edilemez ve daha agresifler. Messmer (2 saat) ve Gaius (2,5 saat) dışında pek de zorlayan bir boss olmadı. Tabii bir de Radahn var. Kendisi oyun tarihimin en zorlayan boss'u oldu ve denemeler, video izlemeler vesaire derken sonunda 9 saatte geçtim. Int büyücüsü olarak geçmek neredeyse imkansız, saçma sapan bir adam. DLC'de bazı eksiklikler yok değil. Haritanın bazı yerleri ıssız ve boş. Keşif ana oyundaki kadar tatmin edici değil, taş veya tarif kitabı çıkıyor paso. Ben dlc'yi ana oyunu bitirdiğim zırh, moonveil kılıcı ve asayla bitirdim. Buildim çok iyi olduğu için ve alıştığımdan dolayı yeni bir şeye geçmek istemedim ama beni buna iten bir şey de bulamadım açıkçası. Boss'lardan düşen büyüler ve silahlar faith istiyordu hep.

Jiggaub,This DLC is essentially a whole new game. I am probably 20 hours in and about half way through the main quest line. Give or take. My only complaint is area order is pretty hard to figure out without some sort of research. I ended up going from area 4 or 5 to like 15 something like that. But it is pretty easy to figure out when you are in an area that you are severely under leveled. Is the game hard? Absolutely it is very hard. But using a mimic or some other buffs make it pretty manageable. Anyone complaining about this DLC I would imagine is very under leveled and needs to explore more before jumping into it. I think they recommend minimum level of 130 or 140 to begin the DLC. I truly cannot see why there are so many negative reviews.,10,2024-06-28,PLAYSTATION 5,user
eri41205,"Comparing to other souls game this dlc is **** is indeed beautiful but there's no music in this game to be remembered.Side quests are scattered around the whole map and could not be finished if you explore the map too much. If you talk to one NPC, other NPC might just gone to nowhere.Bosses are equipped with high poise and long-chain combos, which makes most of the main bosses in this dlc less fun than usual dlc bosses in Dark Souls series or Bloodborne.People say good stuff about this game because it is a legacy game, they don't give enough credit to older souls game so now Sekiro is Goty and Elden Ring's media score sky rocketed. IMO, the core mechanic is still the same, I love the art in all souls game, but how they handle this dlc's map design is disappointing (little to none map explore rewards), you have to go over every corner and either find out an important side quest gesture that you don't know where it belongs or a smithing stone lvl 4. Most of this dlc is great but I hope next souls game could have a better design boss fight so I don't have to roll five or six times in a row to dodge all the hits that blasted in to my face.",3,2024-06-28,PLAYSTATION 5,user

I can't stand bosses with 20-30seconds intro saying how much they love themselves and who they are before kicking my ass... Really?? I can't stand the emptyness and the sandboxyness of the world. The music is really great, the panoramic landscapes are beautiful but I need more. I need tension, I need dread, I need to feel in Danger, I need to feel like I could really be there and this look way too much like a weird dream that never took place before I came in and that is frozen in time even though I just passed 300 hours killing every living thing in it, won't budge. Learn to have facial animations, to have NPCs acting and taking part of the story/action with the player and populate the land like there was something there not just aboriginal patrol dudes that I need to kill because I got nothing else to do.

The overworld is big and beautiful, at some points even more beaitiful than in the main game. But mostly it feels like they forgot to program loot. Exploring the whole map doesn't feel as rewarding as in the main game. You can search an area for like 30 Minites without finding anything at several points which is kind of frustrating 2. There are some points so annoying and frustrating they brought me nearly to the point of deleting the game. For example the place were several knighrs are fighting a **** as you're joining this war everyone suddenly forgets this big **** dragon and attacks you. Oviously the dragon, too. So you have two options, you try to fight like 20 Knights, 5 Archer and a dragon at once or you wait for 7 Minutes until the dragon killed everybody before you join the battle. That's peak game ****. But except this 2 little points a can just repeat my review for the main game. It's an breathtaking beautiful and fun experience.

All directions were used, the map stretches from the extreme north to the extreme south, from top to bottom, there is always more and more to be discovered, and God knows I explored this game too much and there is still more to be found. There are so many bosses, so many enemies, and always in wonderful scenarios that simply enchant you; at no point does the player feel ****'s scary to think about the size of this DLC, but most of all it's scary to think that human beings made this, and not literal Gods, this is, by far the best DLC ever made for a game, and maybe forever will be.",10,2025-01-07,PLAYSTATION 5,user

nVxx,"Utterly satisfying. Shadow of the Erdtree is a natural and satisfying complement to the original masterpiece. It's also worth mentioning that this is the first (story) DLC I've ever played and was very excited to do so. And of course all of this excitement is grounded in the acceptance of Elden Ring being a masterpiece, despite all the objective and subjective shortcomings. So, if you loved the main game, then Shadow of the Erdtree is a must. Firstly - it's massive, it took me 50+ hours to finish compared to the 200+ of the original game and that's more than enough. I disagree with the complaints about the game's 40$ price tag, since it's still a very dense experience that outshines the value of many full-priced AAA titles actually. Of course, it's smaller than the original, but the original was huge, to the point that after some 160 hours of play I was torn between the itch of exploring every spot I missed and wanting it to be over. While having a smaller map size, the map is much, much more densely packed. The size of the map is similar to Limgrave, but, for one, there is much more verticality, also the points of interest are closer to each other. The only complaint here is that the main game's map layout feels more natural, though this is the Shadow Realm, so maybe that's also on purpose. All in all this helps SotE to conclude on the high note of feeling satisfactory and not overwhelming. The DLC is nicely woven into the main game, both from gameplay and story perspective, as if the story was initially planned with the DLC in mind. Shadow Realms is visually very impressive, and FromSoftware manages once again to deliver the same wow effect when transitioning from the cave to getting the first glimpse of Shadowlands. From the first glance, it's clear that Shadow Realm has its own visual identity. Not only through its locations but also primarily through its visual style. You could easily guess from a screenshot whether it's Shadow Realm or Lands Between. That said, I should admit that it's not as visually striking as some of the main game locations, but that's partly because the main game had the advantage of this first wow effect. Some aspects I didn't care about were the new combat styles and weapons. I ended up playing the whole game with my main-game character and build, only occasionally switching to the new stronger talismans and armors from DLC. Speculating about a possible Elden Ring 2, SotE maybe wouldn't cut it, but it's more than one can expect for a DLC.",10,2024-12-30,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Every boss needs all these flashing effects going on, then you take tons of damage at some random time. Your not learning the times from the animations, your learning them by counting how long from the moment the attack starts. Yes I completed the DLC before writing this. But this new direction FS are going in where they are constantly trying to 1 up themselves by making things more extreme, just isn't for me. Malenia **** in the base game. I didn't want to fight several more similar bosses. I love hard bosses. Why else would I play these games. But when you have no idea what's even going on cos of the exaggerated effects, just feels tedious to learn. I still prefer Dark Souls 1. Encounters were just overall more thought through, and boss attacks were easy to pick-up and understand. Not a bunch of disco light. Oh yh. If you enjoy your 60 fps in the base game. Your gonna love the constant stutters in the DLC. The moment you enter the DLC, despite the area having less stuff going on, your frame rate is all over the place. Still no performance fix patch as of 26th November 2024. I normally don't care about Unreal Engine. However I think they need to finally switch. Lies of P is a clear example that these games just work better on UE. From software games on PC, always feel terrible compared to consoles. Apperantly it doesn't pre compile shaders on PC?? The DLC does look nice. Area can be fun to explore. Some enemy types and weapons were fun. They just dropped the ball on the bosses.

Zonas deslumbrantes en su apartado artístico, nuevas mazmorras plagadas de secretos (a veces muy enrevesados) y detalles, enemigos desafiantes nuevos y bosses a la altura de la grandeza del juego original. La dificultad es bastante alta pero no injusta y se ofrece un mayor abanico de posibilidades con nuevas armas, hechizos, etc. El lore añadido es muy interesante y resuelve muchas dudas que quedaron en el aire en el juego base. Solo puedo sacar un punto negativo realmente reseñable: lo exageradamente vasto que es. A la repetición de bosses que nos acostumbró ya el juego base se le añaden las aspiraciones de hacer un mapa gigantesco, lo que ha provocado que muchas zonas del mapa estén muy vacías y, exceptuando su arte, no hay nada que me incite visitarlas. Esto es un problema que no se puede ignorar y que ha perjudicado mi experiencia de juego.

CupoMescitore,"Well...what can you say when one of the most creative team takes 2 years to deliver a DLC big as the average open world production of the current days (minimum 50 hours of gameplay) improving the formula of the vanilla game of 2 years before and delivering a massive lore content that could be considered as Elden Ring Part 2? 9/10 only because there are some balance issues with some bosses or mob (did someone say damage output?) and because some elements of the lore and narration, expecially around the end, could've been more detailed and polished.

two-0986kun,2020年代を代表するであろう傑作のDLC。 DLCと言えどボリュームは相当あり、ストーリー面だけでなく様々な武器なども追加されているため最後まで飽きることなくエルデンリングの世界を堪能できました。 10点を付けなかった理由は、すでに完成されすぎていた世界観のDLCなので「驚き」が無かったという事です。 驚きが無かったからといってつまらないというわけではなく、既に完成されてる世界観を楽しむ時間が更に増えたという感覚に近いです。 エルデンリングを楽しめた人なら満足できると思います。,9,2024-11-12,PLAYSTATION 5,user

SimoAlpha,"What to say? The best videogame expansion ever until now. It can provide, for the first run, like 40-50 high quality hours. The world design is improved from the base game, and the Shadow Realm remembers Lordran for its complexity and the number of interconnections. The DLC pushes you to explore carefully, because some entire sections with important bosses are very well hidden behind dungeons or even fake walls. The boss fights are incredibly stunning and choreographic, even though some are a bit problematic, like “dirty” in moveset, with moves difficult to predict. The difficulty is pretty high, but if you know how to exploit what the game offers, it can become a lot easier (there are of course OP weapons, incantations and summons). The narration is clear and also more explicit than expected, the NPCs are quite numerous and their quests easy to understand (with some exceptions, sadly).

S3XU4LH34L1NG,Incredible densly packed extensive spectacle from start to finish. I have 2 criticisms: 1) In typical FROMSOFT fashion the dlc is acessed more or less at the end of the game which makes using the dlc weapons and spells awkward for the base game if you dont go for ng+ which many ppl dont like. 2) The final boss is crazy hard.

I was wary about getting it prior to release (mainly because of the price tag), but after seeing that people thought it was worth it, I finally bit the bullet. I wish I didn't. The whole map is too winding and confusing, with basically nothing in it. New weapons I found were worthless or unable to be used with my build (I guess we're all big fans of INT+FTH in this DLC, huh), bosses felt uninspired or just the same unbalanced junk that has plagued FS games forever (i.e. big enemy that hops around in large room), even mini dungeons with no bosses at the end. My build used a lot of Vigor and heavy armour, plus a shield; I still got melted in two hits by most things. After some hours it started to feel like a chore and I just wasn't having fun anymore. I like hard games, I like challenging myself. This doesn't feel like that. Couldn't even be bothered to finish it. I loved the base game and played it a few times. That won't be happening with this.

DarkMadison,"I’m a huge Fromsoftware fan who has a platinum trophy in all their games. All those games starting with Demon Souls are masterpieces to me. I preordered Shadow of the Erdtree and was counting minutes to start playing the most anticipated DLC EVER. At first, the game looked a top notch but over the course of time, I started noticing numerous flaws of the game. Good sides of the DLC: 1) Some visuals and bosses design are impressive. Disappointments: 1) No trophies 2) Unfair difficulty and constant one shots. The game tries everything possible to make me fight a boss as long as possible to prolong the DLC duration. The bosses are too aggressive, leaving me frustrated after beating them. 3) Poor exploration. The vanilla game caught my attention immediately. There was always something interesting to find, upgrades, weapons, golden seeds. There was a sense of wonder to puzzle out every secret the game has. The majority of DLC is absolutely empty. 4) Poor rewards. After riding empty fields for 30 minutes, the best reward the game can provide is another cookbook. 5) Extremely boring dungeons. Even though many criticized the main game dungeons, I found them pretty interesting to explore with many secrets and chilling bosses at the end. Here many dungeons not only don’t provide anything interesting, but some dungeons even don’t have a boss. 6) Overly interconnected world which feels unpleasant and tedious to explore. All in all, Fromsoftrare has delivered the worst DLC. The game feels completely unfair and not engaging at all. To play SotE is a monotonous job unlikely FS games.

The relentless difficulty spike and unforgiving combat mechanics clearly catered to the most hardcore players, leaving casual gamers like me in the dust. Additionally, the ridiculous move sets of some bosses felt artificially difficult and contrived, creating a sense of cheapness rather than genuine challenge. I longed for the sense of wonder and exploration I once felt, but it was replaced by a grind that felt more like a chore than an adventure, so I had to step away.",2,2024-09-02,PLAYSTATION 5,user

If you are the type that aren't good at Soulslike games, but needs to solo everything and won't use mimic or NPC summons, because of gatekeepers, but are unwilling to sacrifice time to get better, or even switch to shield poking, which i did for 2 bosses, then I don't recommend this game because a few of the bosses, and especially the last boss is brutal.

LordBarco,"ELDEN RING - SHADOW OF THE ERDTREE REVIEW FromSoftware is now the most lauded developer when it comes to action online RPGs, and their Soulslike formula seems to be thriving for some specific type of gamers: Hardcore gamers, but for casual fans, their difficult games have now become a nuisance as you need hundreds of hours to become a master and finish a fight with a specific enemy, most likely bosses, and in the end that sense of accomplishment is simply devoid of joy as these games, at least for me, have now become boring, when they should be praised for the many other aspects SETTING You can get here after you defeated Mogh the Lord of Blood (one of the toughest bosses in the game, mind you) and you will be transported to the Land of Shadow, where you need to uncover the secrets of Miquela. Pretty straight FromSoftware stuff. MECHANICS • Combat: remains the same as the base game with the introduction of new weapons and skills. But now the difficulty has been increased as even if you are overleveled in the base game, you need to collect specific items in this world to become strong enough. Yes, enemies will kill you with 1 it or 2 hits. Ludicrous, but if you liked the base game, you would like this expansion. Bosses are harder than the base game, and the idiocy of repeating this boring cycle of death and coming back is not rewarding at all, as bosses won’t yield anything good for you to feel you are progressing your character. • Exploration: the best aspect of this game. FromSoftware has become better and better at designing and developing complex intricate worlds. The world design of the Lands of Shadow is one of the best I have seen in any other video game. Exploring this world is the best aspect of the game.VISUALSTheir engine is now becoming old, you can see it. Although the game is a visual marvel, it does not compare with other titles, like God of War. Still, the graphics are very good, dark, grimy, and that sense of unwholesomeness is ever present. The staple of FromSoftware. SOUNDS & MUSIC Great! The new OST for this game is good and it will immerse you more in the exploration. The sounds and music are very well put and even with the frustration of the boss battles, you will enjoy the musical score. FINAL THOUGHTSA good game which best aspect is exploration. I could buy 100 games like this for the sole purpose of doing exploration and not engaging in combat at all. This game suffers from the same boredom that FromSoftware is characterized, and that is becoming old. Gamers seem to like this, I don’t, as I do not have hundreds of hours to dedicate myself to a single game. A shame, as this could have been a wondrous adventure. No more for me with FromSoftware unless they put difficulty levels. If you like your butt being kicked, go for it, buy it, but if you play for the joy of relaxing… STAY AWAY FROM THIS NIGHTMARE!",4,2024-08-25,PLAYSTATION 5,user
MacMo,"In terms of graphics, scope and creativity, it's probably the best thing I've ever seen in a DLC.

FromSoftware is one of the best studios in history and Elden Ring in particular was able to showcase this, despite the minor criticisms of the main game! My problem with SotE is simply that I expected a DLC like The Old Hunters, a flawless masterpiece for a game like Elden Ring and these expectations were not met in any way. The bosses have too little character (e.g. cutscenes) and are often poorly animated/designed, as are the weapons, for example. Only a few bosses like Bayle, Midra, Dancing Lion or Messmer meet the huge expectations of a FromSoftware Elden Ring DLC, although I'm sure that the fault lies with Sony, a company that ultimately cannot compete with a studio like FromSoftware, which makes an extreme effort to stand out through quality, as we already had with Dark Souls! So why the good rating? To counteract the extremely subjective, unfair evaluations of frustrated people! I am sure that FromSoftware is not the only one to blame for the problems of SotE, which objectively are not as serious as they are described!",10,2024-08-04,PLAYSTATION 5,user

MetaBones,"As an expansion, this might be the most ambitious and well-worth DLC that's been made. It has so many hours of quality content with incredible places to explore, fun and challenging bosses to fight, and interesting lore that expands on the base game in meaningful ways. I'm truly happy with buying it and it really fills in Elden Ring into a complete fantasy RPG experience. That being said, I do have criticms. First one, difficulty. I've played through every ince of Elden Ring base game as well as Dark Souls and Bloodborne and I can say that the difficulty with some of these bosses (two in particular) are designed so brutal, it's not balanced and fair in any least bit. I had to resort to a completely different build that required no skill just to complete the last boss and I know I will never fight him again. Second, exploration is haulted at so many turns due to it's lack of interconnectivity (something FromSoftware is known for). Traversing to different locations and pieces of the maps require way too obscure methods to get there and these paths are just too hidden that looking up guides just to see where to go to progress is frustrating. Third, fire furnace golems. Done The game truly is incredible and it is a high-quality piece of DLC that is very much worth the price tag but the extreme difficulty, obscure and confusing traversal, and unfun enemies do make me concerned about their future with the next games.

Redrex456,"A fantastic DLC to a great game. The world building, art direction, level design, and boss design are all top notch. Just like the base game, the world here is full of jaw dropping locations that will take your breath away. The gargantuan scale of many of the areas is matched by the brilliant level design which emphasizes verticality and rewards exploring off the beaten path through hidden entrances to new areas that can only be accessed as a result of thorough exploration. Shadow Keep in particular is one of the most spectacular levels I have ever seen in a video game with its foreboding visual design, masterful use of environmental storytelling, and sprawling non linearity. The only criticism I could make of the world design is that the methods to access certain areas sometimes feel too far off the beaten path to the point where they are way too unintuitive for the player to find on their own without looking up a guide. The overall boss roster in this DLC is exceptional. While there are certainly some stinker bosses which are not at all fun to learn, most of the main story bosses are among the finest of any of FromSoft’s work. Many of them have great build up through the levels preceding them, a learning curve that is very steep but fair for the player to get better at, and unforgettable visual spectacle that is incredible to behold. I would also be remiss if I didn’t make mention of the absolutely phenomenal soundtrack for the boss fights that does wonders to heighten the adrenaline fueled intensity of many of the boss encounters. The boss fights are also complimented well by the various new effective weapons, Ashes of War, and Talismans which give the player many viable options to deal with the at times overwhelming challenge posed by the boss fights. Overall, if you enjoyed Elden Ring’s base game, you will undoubtedly love this DLC. It has taken everything great about the base game and amplified it to 11.

Whether you prefer a stealthy assassin, a mighty warrior, or a mystical sorcerer, the game caters to a variety of playstyles. The diversity in builds ensures that players can experiment with different strategies, each offering a unique and entertaining approach to combat and exploration. 2. Insane Replayability:Elden Ring excels in replayability. Starting over with a new character feels like stepping into a completely different game. Each build provides a fresh experience, making it easy to get lost in the game world time and time again. This aspect is a testament to the game’s depth and the developers’ commitment to creating a dynamic and engaging experience. 3. Exceptional World Building:The game’s world is a marvel of design and creativity. FromSoftware has crafted a vast and intricately detailed landscape that feels alive and brimming with secrets. Every corner of the map invites exploration, rewarding players with stunning vistas and hidden treasures. 4. Immersive Lore:The lore of Elden Ring is both captivating and deeply woven into the game’s fabric. Instead of straightforward exposition, the story unfolds through environmental storytelling, item descriptions, and fragmented lore scattered throughout the world. This approach enhances immersion, encouraging players to piece together the narrative on their own and adding layers to their journey. The Bad: 1. Overly Aggressive Bosses in the DLC:While the base game offers a challenging but fair experience, the DLC introduces bosses with hyper-aggressive tactics and fewer openings for punishment. This shift can make certain builds less viable and significantly increases the difficulty. Although these bosses are beatable, the frustration they can induce may detract from the enjoyment for some players. 2. Frustrating World Building in the DLC:The DLC’s world building, while impressive at times, can become a labyrinthine challenge. Discovering content and progressing through the DLC often requires external guides, as some crucial story elements and bosses are hidden behind obscure paths. This can be a barrier to immersion and might hinder players who prefer a more intuitive exploration experience. 3. Awful Final Boss Design:The final boss of Elden Ring is a significant letdown, embodying many of the game’s worst design aspects. This boss encounter is marred by poor design choices, including an inadequately adapted camera system that struggles to handle both large and small enemies. The result is a frustrating battle that can overshadow the otherwise impressive experience of the game. Conclusion: Elden Ring is an extraordinary achievement in game design, offering unparalleled depth in character customization, replayability, and world-building. Its lore, told through a compelling and immersive narrative, adds an extra layer of intrigue. However, the DLC’s design introduces elements that can be both frustrating and challenging, and the final boss encounter falls short of the game’s high standards. Despite these drawbacks, Elden Ring remains a must-play title for fans of the genre, delivering a rich and memorable adventure with its share of epic triumphs and notable missteps.",9,2024-07-25,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Fubuism,"2 years after finishing elden ring I returned as a tarnished again for this epic adventure. Fromsoft are brilliant, they found a way to level the playing fields between who finished the base game once and those who capped their levels and stats. Shadow of erdtree is smaller than base game, so everything is more condensed and thrilling, enemies are lethal if you are not careful, many secret areas and the bosses are quite a challenge even for a fromsoftwaregame. my wife, who's not really into games, was just chilling next to me while I was battling Rellana and the lion amd she was having a blast. It was so intense and thrilling, and I had a blast fighting those bosses. In my opinion, the point of the game isn't just to win, but to learn and adapt to the bosses' moves and **** graphics are amazing, man! I'm playing it on my Xbox Series X with a 77-inch G3 TV, and the frame rate is super stable and smooth. The soundtrack is also awesome, and the gameplay is just spot **** game and its downloadable content are of exceptional quality and will undoubtedly leave a lasting impact on the annals of video game history.",10,2024-07-24,PLAYSTATION 5,user

SomeCallMeMoose,"The DLC starts out well enough but that excitement slowly whimpers out and dies. The bosses aren’t all that fun to fight and it has little to do with artificial difficulty or the fragment system. So many of them just feel so uninspired or copies of previous bosses we’ve seen in the past. The locations are pretty albeit empty and devoid of anything interesting enough to justify exploration. The world map doesn’t help either, the current system not supporting areas with multiple layers of verticality. So many areas and bosses feel like they have so much to offer at first but are often shallow and making you wish for it to just be over already.",7,2024-06-25,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Abraham15,"I think this is hands down the best downloadable content/DLC I've ever seen. It has a slightly high price, I bought it initially for €40 which could be the price of a complete video game, but if you like Elden Ring I think it is worth it. It provides many hours of gameplay between weapons, summons, armor, enemies and story. The map is massive and the design of the levels and the map itself is very well done, as always. Maybe the DLC ends a little abruptly, I would have preferred another ending, but it is what it is. There are a lot of areas of the map that are a little empty, but they are empty compared to the base game, and I don't think they are empty, but rather the DLC has a different design. I think they wanted the areas of the map to be much more open and clear instead of narrow and full of things to discover. I think it is not a lack of content by any means, but a change in the design, also to differentiate it from the base **** my opinion, the DLC is perfect as it is, a masterpiece that, together with the base game, becomes an essential part of the history of video games.",10,2024-07-19,PLAYSTATION 5,user
D3NGZ,"this DLC is so great and packed with some of the best FROM SOFTWARE work ever downvoting it because its "" too hard "" is idiotic.. its supposed to be harder than the main Elden Ring game. to be put it simply it enhances the main game in the best way possible. Pros: + the most incredible level design i have ever seen, everything is so vertical and DENSE. + the art design is light years ahead of other game in the shadow realm. + The Soundtrack is of highest quality and really memorable. + The new zones and Dungeons are even better now with how deep they go, the Shadow Keep branches out so much its mind boggling. + The New Story & Lore really give us alot of answers and help improve the main game story. + many added talismans, weapons, spells, incantations, armor sets and various new secrets to find. + the map itself it is gorgeous and a joy to explore. + new Bosses and enemies are again top quality and are fun to take down. + New characters are interesting and have fairly detailed side quests that blends into the main one. Cons: - some performance issues during the last boss and sometimes slight fps drops while exploration. - expected more shown from the final cutscene personally. in closing : its a Jaw dropping expansion to and already all time great game and every person who liked Elden Ring should play it.",10,2024-07-19,PLAYSTATION 5,user

NestorMakhno,"This is addressed to Fromsoftware: Please, just a remake of Bloodborne. Don't touch Bloodborne otherwise. We (and by ""we"" I mean ""I"" ) don't need a Bloodborne 2 with the current design direction Extremely unfun bosses, copypasted general characteristics with just the animations to differentiate one from another. The description ""High Health, High Damage, Immune to stagger, Huge posture bars, long combos, constant aoe attacks, very short windup animations OR extremely delayed attacks (no middle ground ) , attacking through blinding effects"" applies to a great number of them. I could be literally describing any one of more than ten bosses. You are replaying the same idea over and over and over, and only differentiate animations. Please, please, never return to Bloodborne. Just a remake of the original masterpiece will suffice. Your design has failed. Spectacularly. Edit: This is addressed to potential customers. I am now at my 6th playthrough of the DLC My rating began at... I believe 4/10 The more I experience this DLC and understand better the conscious design decisions of the studio in the making of the bosses, the more my rating fell. It can go no lower at this point. This is definitely the last time I preorder anything fromsoftware. This product is just excrement (comparing it to the standards this company has set for itself).

In the base game, I got used to it and there was a sense of satisfaction after defeating an enemy. Here, there's only frustration, and even when you manage to beat an enemy, there's no satisfaction, just frustration. You beat them more by chance or misunderstanding than by skill. Maybe I'm bad at the game or maybe the bosses are too overpowered. I didn't enjoy it this time. I don't think the balancing is good. I've always managed to overcome every stage in a game by persevering, but this is too much. The final boss is unplayable, even when maxed out with all blessings, it's unplayable, one **** my opinion, a game shouldn't be this frustrating. They say that if you understand the patterns, you can eventually succeed. Well, I must be really bad because I'm missing something.

Claro, tem áreas novas muito bonitas, maior diversidade de cenários e novos tipos de armas, mas a parte boa parou por aí: - Ter upado seu personagem em nível alto não adianta de nada, vc vai ter que explorar todo mapa para achar os itens de upgrade, os quais são contadinhos, senão vc vai morrer pra ataque básico de 2-hits do soldadinho no mapa aberto; - Maioria dos itens adicionados neste jogo são inúteis, e as recompensas de diversos sub-bosses e main bosses são nada demais; - O final do jogo (que até então não acreditava que tinha realmente acabado) é uma cutscene de 10 SEGUNDOS! Conseguiu ser pior do que o jogo principal; - A história da DLC em si é mais confusa do que o padrão da Fromsoftware. Totalmente me desinteressei pela história; - E o pior defeito: os Bosses principais. Todos voam, super rápidos, arenas gigantes, stamina infinita e esponja de HP. Praticamente colocaram chefes de Sekiro num jogo Souls, a disparidade de velocidade é absurda, uma dificuldade artificial preguiçosa.

While some bosses can be punishing with notoriously flashy moves, this does not detract against the overall experience as the increased variety of tools and enhancements at your disposal is more than enough to overcome them.

ericiidx,"Maybe I'm just burnt out on the formula -- I've been a big fan since Demon's Souls -- but I struggled to enjoy my time with this DLC. It slots into the base game perhaps a bit too well, in that it's chock full of huge grassy fields of nameless tombstones and ghostly enemies, and not much else. I couldn't help but feel reminded about how the final few areas of the base game ran out of steam (excluding Miquella's Haligtree, which was excellent.) The general level design is frustratingly vertical, but the vistas are still as beautiful as they ever were. The new leveling mechanic, which only applies within the confines of the DLC area, was immediately a turnoff. I did enjoy 2 or 3 of the new bosses, and vehemently disliked the rest (including the final boss, who was a pretty big letdown for a number of reasons.) Only one of them really stuck with me as a quality encounter with genuine difficulty that rewards your perseverance (if you've been watching the pre-release trailers, you can probably guess who I'm talking about.) Otherwise, they are either boring pushovers or horribly over-tuned for the sake of... what? So people on social media will opine about how soooo hard the game is? So you feel you got your money's worth? Without spoiling anything, I found most of the bosses extremely uninteresting, visually and thematically -- some of the weakest, laziest encounters in the entire Soulsborne catalog. It pains me to think that this DLC was just a huge cash grab; finally a ding to my steel-clad confidence in Fromsoft games/expansions. I await their next game with bated breath -- ""automatic pre-order"" is indefinitely off the table. Be prepared for lots of reskins, dragons (always a real treat!), and Mimic Tear lookalikes... and there are a whole lot of them here. ""Quantity over quality"" a la Dark Souls 2 comes to mind. The Bloodstarved Beast model from Bloodborne even makes a cameo to help pad the boss count. Ultimately, I think this is a good way to assess whether or not you should buy this: did you finish the base game and feel hungry for more of the same? If so, buy this. Did you excitedly trek all the way through Bloodborne's 60 million chalice dungeons to Queen Yharnam, smiling all along the way as you fought boring reskin boss after boring reskin boss? You're gonna love it. If you felt satisfied finishing the base game with little to no desire to revisit it, hard pass.",4,2024-07-10,PLAYSTATION 5,user
Feverdream,"I will say that my casual, explore every corner and kill every beast style has paid off well for this sequel.

Find a boss, find a weakness, make an arsenal. And that’s only one tool! The spirit ashes, weapons, status effects, etc. have been upgraded for use in the arena.

I platinumed the game, and finished on Game plus 3 in order to get all the endings. Now with the DLC my over-leveling counts for very little, and I have the additional difficulty of the Games Plus 3. And further upgrading is finite based on a treasure hunt. Solution? removed the difficulty penalty that comes with Game plus. The game plus difficulty increase was to balance the over leveling that came with each play through. Removing only the over leveling benefit makes the game unbalanced",5,2024-07-08,PLAYSTATION 5,user
Bittelille,"Very disappointed in this DLC. As a big soulsborne fan I had high hopes for this release as Fromsoft usually delivers big time with their DLC content, but unfortunately this time was different. Shadow of the Erdtree suffers from a lot of the same flaws as the main game, but to me they seem even more apparent in the DLC. The bosses are poorly designed, so much so a lot of them weren’t even remotely fun to fight. The difficulty makes their design flaws outright impossible to ignore, as you’ll likely have to spend a lot of time fighting some of them (which would have been completely fine if the boss fights felt polished and engaging.) The map is again too big for it’s own good, as several areas feel empty and unfinished, and there’s still far too much reused content. The map design itself is great, but exploring no longer feels as rewarding, as you mostly just find stuff you don’t need. You’re likely to depend way too much on google to find certain areas and bosses, to the point were it doesn’t feel like I’m playing the game the intended way. I was never a fan of the combat style of Elden Ring in the first place, and the way these bosses just put on a show rather than giving you a proper learning experience and a proper fight, just feels slightly annoying at best, and outright ridiculous at worst. They’ve managed to do this right plenty of times before, which is why this feels so frustrating to me. A high difficulty does not equal good content, even for a game series that’s known for its difficulty. If they ever decide to make another soulsborne game, I really hope they give the bosses the same love and attention as they did in bloodborne and sekiro. This just ain’t it.",3,2024-07-07,PLAYSTATION 5,user
ClamDaniel,"Like many fans, I've played every ""Soulsborne"" game and DLC. This is the first content that I am on the fence about recommending to fans. Shadow of the Erdtree has a few of the most interesting/spectacular environments of all the games, but it also has the worst boss designs. There were exactly 3 bosses that I thought were fun and worth learning, and that I would consider trying to beat various NG+s.

Je pense notemment à bayle ou le lion dansant.. A la fin tu as même un affrontement contre 3/4 pnj en même temps si ça c'est pas augmenter artificiellement la difficulté quand tu joues sans invocation..

Luifilth,"Jogo excelente, maravilhoso, muito gostoso de jogar. Mas infelizmente perdi a vontade de continuar. Estou no último boss e o desafio é totalmente bizarro, não há outra palavra para definir aquela aberração, parece que hoje em dia o objetivo dos desenvolvedores é fazer jogos cada vez mais difíceis e deixar de lado a diversão. Podem dizer o que quiserem mas aquele último boss não é justo nem um pouco, passei por todos os outros, sem maiores dificuldades, não digo que foi fácil, mas pelo menos foi justo, até mesmo o gaius, que é o pior boss que já tiveram a capacidade de criar, mas ainda assim foi uma luta justa. E eu não vejo como isso pode satisfazer as pessoas, vejo videos no youtube de pessoas extremamente estressadas por causa do jogo, tudo bem que se sentem aliviadas e até felizes depois que passam um desafio, mas a quantidade de sofrimento que têm que passar para se alcançar esse objetivo é gigante. Eu falo por mim mesmo, quando a dificuldade é exagerada como é o caso desse último boss, eu não sinto nem um pingo de prazer ou satisfação em completar o objetivo, morrer 100, 200, 300 vezes para um boss não é o que eu consideraria diversão. Acredito que os desenvolvedores deveriam repensar seus conceitos e talvez se lembrem que games foram inventados para distrair, dar prazer e alegria, na minha opinião esqueceram completamente o que é isso. E digo mais, posso até tentar finalizar o jogo, se o fizer, quero tentar sem driblar a dificuldade do jogo, sem usar glitchs, invocações, magias, magos... pois jogo apenas com um tipo de build sempre, dex e não vou usar nada além das cinzas de guerra para vencer, mas podem ter certeza que nunca mais jogo ele e com toda certeza não vou me sentir nem um pouco feliz, ele apenas vai entrar para minha lista de jogos que finalizei, o jogo base era e foi justo, a dlc com seu boss final não tem nada de justiça. Tenho 40 anos e estou velho demais para ficar me estressando com uma coisa que deveria me proporcionar bem estar e satisfação. Ps: as lutas contra a Rellana e o Messmer, além de serem justas foram as melhores lutas da dlc, mesmo com algumas hit box toscas. A movimentação dos dois é maravilhosa, uma das coisas que mais me impressionaram em elden ring foi a movimentação, muitas vezes é simplesmente maravilhoso ver a fluidez de movimentos.

arcboy,"An absolute masterpiece. In my opinion the level design in this DLC surpasses the base game by far, and might even be From’s best level design to date. The way the different areas utilize verticality is truly awe inspiring. Crossing a bridge on the highest mountains peaks and looking down to the deep depths below, only to be down in the depths later looking up at the tiny shadow of that same bridge way up above being swallowed by the sunlight above it. The smaller dungeons in the DLC feel like they have so much more purpose than in the base game, all with their own unique theming and feeling of history in the world. The new enemy and boss designs are awesome, and some of the bosses were really tough. Some reused enemy designs (looking at you ulcerated tree spirit) but the amount of cool and new enemies makes me not even care. New weapon types are really fun to use, some need some balancing but most are really cool, as well as all the new AOWs. Just overall an absolute incredible experience and I couldn’t have asked for more. From Software nailed it again. 10/10",10,2024-07-04,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Buti don't know why, as soon as I entered the dlc something changed, I was very invested in exploring this grim yet beautiful land of the shadows. Not only that, but I had a lot of fun with the bosses, especially the final one, and beating them just felt as satisfying as back in the day when I was playing Dark Souls 3 or Bloodborne.

I'm not great at this and have over leveled to help me, an amazing aspect of the original game. Now I'm stuck, I apparently need to collect arbitrary McGuffins to regain my ability to survive. Found a knight guy whos killed me 30 times and I'm going to lose my souls, I was like 20k from a level and at lvl 195 that's a good bit. I'm just really frustrated and since I cant gain xp to be able to handle stronger mobs, I'm going to have to look up a guide to be able to progress. I don't like how its set up and I cant get into it because all I've managed to do is hit wall after wall. A lot of the good aspects of the progression from the main game are simply gone because of the change. Now its just up a weapons o max and either wear armor or not. The effects from the arbitrary McGuffins are all that matter, and I don't even understand how to find them without a guide. its so much work only get stuck figuring out how to, figure out how to progress.

You forgot this game is challenging ?! Cause after personally being gone through it I can state there's no such difference between base game and DLC when it comes to difficulty, same exact hassle against bosses as well as throughout each single area. Seems like playing other games in two years made players accustomed to a lower difficulty and thereby intolerant to FromSoft standard... What the heck ! This said this DLC is in my point of view the simple continuity of the original game but with some more verticality, all praises already declaimed two years ago still stand, next step for the company would be to possibly improve online and coop play ? Being able to play it like a Sekiro game as well ? Or any other fancy and great idea Miazaki has been able to bring to this incredible software company.

The fact is, Shadow of the Erdtree is designed poorly. Bosses have mechanics that are not fun to deal with, like frame perfect dodging and camera issues. Developer's solution is to add little yellow McGuffins over the area that make the game playable again. It's lazy and uninspired. Exploration is strong, but when it's required to progress, it feels different. Kind of like someone putting your favorite meal in front of you and then saying, ""You better eat this, or else..."".

laughlinzach,"Pretty great expansion when comparing to other games add-ons. Here are my thoughts: Bosses: 8/10. Some are my favorite of the whole series, including Messmer, Midra, and the final boss. Of course, each of these are humanoid bosses with parry windows making for interactive fights. The bigger bosses / non humans are what you've come to expect, e.g., awful camera and lock-on systems. Level Design: 7/10 - I think the level design is good and reminiscent of dark souls one. There's so many areas that are a puzzle to even get into, which makes finding them even better. However, it's not as cohesive as you'd expect. There's a lot of open fields and filler areas with nothing, no bosses, no rewards, just empty space. A tighter world-map would have been better. Bigger isn't always better. Systems: 6/10 - I appreciate the forethought into the Scadu Tree fragment system, but it felt completely unnecessary. Why not just use base leveling mechanics like the original game? You wind up either under-performing or over-performing based on your fragment level.

FromSoft dlcs have always been the best material of the game and this trend continues here to probably the biggest jump in quality.

Unfortunately, passed the few main dungeons of this DLC, there's not much to do, there's too much empty spaces. There's some dungeons that are better in design than the legacy dungeons from base game but there's definitely a lack of those. There's a total of 10 main bosses, two of them are great, the rest is meh. Special mention for the final boss that is controversial atm, and the ending... Well, it felt like a scam to me. You beat the final boss who's far from easy and... Nothing ? Why ? I don't get it. The new movesets are cool if you're into PvP, some weapons are just broken for PvE too. Overall, new weapons and armors are totally legit. Now about performance... It's worst than the base game and it doesn't serve the game at all, some bosses require perfect timing to dodge specific attacks and frame rate drop at those specific time, every time.

The Scadutree Blessing system it's quite genious, as it levels the playing field to an equal ground to every player regardless of their level. Not leveling up Scadutree Blessing would make the journey incredibly and unnecesarily hard. The bosses themselves, regarding their difficulty are quite well designed, with some minor faults here and there (Like Commander Gaius hit boxes, or FINAL BOSS blinding effects),each fault that can be resolved via a patch. I do not think any boss deserves a nerf, not even the final one. You'll need to change your strat and build to make things easer, get out of your comfort zone, pride only will make you suffer. The exploration it's amazing and the legacy dungeons a sight to behold. This feels like an entirely new game and only makes an already incredible game into one of a legend.

barillas,"The fanbase of this game needs to learn how to handle criticism. Any negative comment about the game is taken personally, as if FromSoftware were a religion. The bosses in this DLC suffer from the same issues as those in the base game, and it's quite frustrating. They spam AoE attacks with excessive visual effects, making it hard to see where to focus. This over-reliance on flashy effects detracts from the gameplay experience, as it becomes more about managing visual clutter than actual skillful combat.Moreover, many bosses feel like recycled versions of each other, with minimal novelty beyond their visuals. It's disappointing to encounter boss after boss that, despite looking different, essentially follows the same attack patterns and strategies. This lack of variety makes the encounters feel repetitive and uninspired. Simply giving a boss almost infinite health is not good game design; it turns battles into tedious endurance tests rather than engaging challenges. A well-designed boss should require players to adapt and strategize, not just chip away at an enormous health bar. The emphasis should be on innovative mechanics and rewarding skillful play, rather than relying on inflated difficulty through health pools and visual bombardment.

The DLC had one! The DLC wasn't as hard as people made it to be either. The bosses were more agile this time around, so they wanted a more aggresive and quick approach. As soon you get the hang of it, its not very difficult (there are 2-3 exception of course :P) All and **** DLC was **** the main game was way better.",7,2024-06-30,PLAYSTATION 5,user

Zquaranteneuf,"June 29, 2024: So far the exploration is satisfying, the new mysteries are interesting, and the art direction is as great as ever, BUT the bosses and minibosses (so far) all employ similar neverending spin-to-win bs movesets as a proxy for actual good design and difficulty. Historically, Fromsoft's games raise the quality bar with their DLCs, but I fear that it's not quite the case here. To be edited if things get better down the line. July 10, 2024 EDIT: Surprisingly had to come back here to LOWER the score from a 7 to a 6. Most of the bosses were bad, with some particularly abysmal.

The bad points are that the enemies were unusually aggressive and the map had many bumps and holes, making it difficult to move around. It was indeed disappointing to be attacked while calling for your friends in the boss battles. But more importantly, I often died from falling, which slowed down the tempo. The NPC events were even more confusing than in the main story, and it was a pity that I could not proceed well, even though I met good characters.

FYI, I reached the final Boss of this DLC, and the difficulty spikes way to high and not logical. I finished all bosses except the Final Boss. Currently the stats caps are unknown, so the character you built over 2 years need to need tweeked all the time; Even-though the DLC give you a boost in stats, everything is canceled with way the world deals damage to the character. The speed of the the world, and the damage is designed to make most gamers uncomfortable, and that's why steam reviews are mixed. the game design is flawed. I wonder whats the dev goal with this DLC.

Might be, for those who want to play it the ""right way"" whithout having the time and effort to put into it. If you're like me and played the game, ""the wrong way"". You probably really liked it. I like how every boss is a new challenge that you have to overcome, and better, they dont feel unfair, but they are definitely unforgiving, some giving you no space for error, and thats where the gaming journalists and ""casual gamers"",(not saying im a hardcore gamer by any means but... im lacking words to describe it right now) they fail to compreend that, its meant to be that way, otherwise there would be no learning curve or builds preferable for an enemy/boss. The DLC is definetely harder than the base game. But everything comes together as a fantastic and beautiful place(at times), despite the grim and dark place you find yourself in.

As músicas e Soundtrack no geral são MUITO BOAS, te deixando imersivo naquele mundo tão vasto, repleto de lugares para explorar e sofrer. Eu achei que os bosses precisavam de mais cutscenes, como a da Rennala, pois, muitos que tinham uma aparencia fodona com poderes irados não tem cutscene nenhuma, não dando assim para ver mais de perto sobre o Boss ou só justamente me deixar mais imersivo durante tal luta.

core_facts,"* The Soulsborne Formula is stale & the cracks are showing * Elden Ring is a decent game. I have I think around 2000 or so hours in the base game which I daresay is more than enough to experience the mechanics and creative directions of the game. The DLC is more of the same and unfortunately, From Software has taken all the misdirected choices of the base game and doubled down on it in the DLC. I've been saying it for a while, but the Soulsborne formula is now the MCU of gaming. Everybody wants to make a souls borne game since it's been successful. Clones everywhere, some fine, some stupid. However, as the OG even From Soft has begun to show that it's decade long formula is actually now stale and bereft of creativity- whether it is narrative, gameplay, combat or level design. DS 1, Bloodborne & Sekiro are of course amazing games and exceptions to this, but the DS trilogy and its successor Elden Ring & SOTE are in general I think mid, repetitive games where the developer is so pressured by the expectations of its fans, they have begun parodying and imitating themselves to capture that curious essence of difficulty. Anyway, coming straight to the DLC. It's more of Elden Ring. The Combat is stale like the base game. Awkward jump mechanics, age old slow rolling simulator experience, press R1 or L2 for attacks that can happen with swift recovery or intense damage; From Soft's ER & SOTE while may look like they have added mechanics, it's actually all rather superficial and there is no in-depth combat mechanics. Just more rolling, some jumping, and flashy weapon arts for teens who like pop blue colors onscreen. Difficulty can be subjective based on the skill level of players. ER is the easiest From Soft game. There's enough ways to play it; however, the basic rule is KILL THE ENEMY BEFORE IT CAN SHOW WHAT IT CAN DO to you. Why? Because your gimped character that moves like it's 2010, can not keep up with bosses that are anime main characters. It is easy to make a difficult game when you gimp the player and super-inflate the enemy. Hardly, a big brain move. It's flashy; From Soft fans tend to confuse the dopamine release of a perfect dodge or parry with GAME GOOD & PERFECT. So,the git gud mentality is actually hurting the brand, since From Soft doesn't really know how to do RPG combat. The only time they got it right was Sekiro & Bloodborne, which anyone would realize are drastically better games than the rolling simulators of the From Soft Gaming Universe. Level Designs are fine. But Souls Open World are tedious experiences and From Soft does not have the skill or experience to design and balance open world mechanics. Yeah, everything looks pretty and there are some intricacies here and there in the DLC but overall the world in the base game and the DLC is a fairly empty but sprawling land with lots of reused enemies and dungeons and caves and meadows. You can even say SOTE follows the narrative design of the base game - enter opening area, kill magic boss, go to Altus, kill boss, find fire, burn tree, kill more boss. It's the same structure really. From Soft are also lazy storytellers. Fans tend to confuse lore dumping as homework for lore channels and players for storytelling. Immersion is subjective, ER & SOTE are not immersive experiences. Of course if you find it immersive, more power to you; but even with Martin's contribution, the story is so basic and underwhelming. Anyone with half a brain would have seen the Miquella twist from a mile away. All those recent trailers simply prove that From Soft is so anxious about people getting the narrative, they dump intriguing story trailers to entice fans and potential buyers only to leave all of them disappointed with item descriptions, unanswered questions. A side note to Miyazaki - mate, you're not a cryptic and deductive story-telling genius, it's rather average, please stop with the ""oooh, but there'll be some answers *wink*"" Anyway, overall, the DLC is fine. Upgrade system is in direct conflict with leveling up in the base game and hence will piss people off because what was the point of grinding the base game. The world is drab, people wouldn't explore, so they added scadutree. The difficulty has finally reached artificial levels - gimped player character, infinite stamina/mana and combo bosses with AOEs and delayed attacks, camera from the 2010s that cannot keep up with the action onscreen; stutters & load issues esp in co-op boss fights, and so on. Of course you can do no-hits or beat the bosses first or second try (I did), or be stuck forever and quit. The game just simply does not a great experience make. Underwhelming, bereft of creativity and balancing, SOTE simply pushes ER in the direction that is painfully obvious - an MMORPG LITE. PS Final Bosses of both ER & SOTE are some of the most underwhelming ones in the From Soft Gaming Universe. Ishin, man you have my heart and my respect.",5,2024-06-25,PLAYSTATION 4,user

OnlyOneHere,"I'm not done with you FromSoftware. I bought the DLC that comes with both the PS4 and PS5 version, so that entitles me to review this game one more time. I also got the original PS4 Elden Ring that came with the PS5 upgrade which entitles me for another review, but I won't review the PS4 base game. I think I am about to cause more damage in this review than your bosses ever will, so this will be the last one. Now normally I'm not a fan of buying DLC, but because it didn't join the greedy trend of releasing DLC around a year later, I was inclined to try it out. It took these lazy developers over 2 years, and there isn't much improvements. Simply buffing up the enemies and calling it a day is lazy game design. And these greedy developers want $40? This garbage reminds me of a Kangaroo Jack cartoon movie I bought for the kids back in the mid-2000s. That movie must've flopped hard for it to end up in the dollar store, so you may not get the reference but whatever, you can look it up. That LL Cool J boxing scene in Kangaroo Jack is FromSoftware's game design in a nutshell. You spend more time dancing than hitting, and it takes too many hits to knock your opponent down. ● Toy-collecting millennials are pathetic with their superiority complex when beating a FromSoftware game. What the WWE is to the NFL and UFC, that is basically what FromSoftware is in video games. The WWE is just a bunch of athletes that couldn't make it in real sports or didn't have the balls to step in the octagon, so they joined a fake sport to feel better about themselves by winning fake matches. That's the same concept with FromSoftware. Just a bunch of gamers that are horrible in online multiplayer or didn't have the guts to choose the hardest difficulty when given the option, so they brag about beating FromSoftware games when all they did is beat fake stupid players (AI) in a fake hard difficulty mode (easy mode is summons and overleveling your character). Take COD BO3 on realistic mode for instance (or any game with a similar difficulty) you can't just dance, use summons or severely overlevel your character for success. You have to strategically figure out how to beat the level and that's how a hard difficulty should be done, not dancing and adding masked cheat codes. ● I'm not denying the game is hard, but it's pathetic to act like you fought in WW2 and lived to tell the tale. Admittedly the DLC is harder than the base game, but only because the devs severely changed the rules and logic of the bosses, which is lazy game design. But once I got the hang of it, this trash became a dancing simulator once again. My daughter's friend is a fashion-oriented stereotypical ""dumb blonde"" and even she was able to beat Elden Ring (base game). For context, she is a casual gamer who plays a lot of Fortnite. If someone of that caliber can beat it, then anyone can if they really wanted to, so I wouldn't be bragging if I were you. Then again she was a cheerleader, and it's like that Bring It On movie said, cheerleaders are basically dancers who've gone retar- (liberal mods may not allow me to say that). FromSoftware needs to make their game design more about hacking and slashing than dancing, and maybe I'll enjoy the game. This DLC was disappointing and I don't recommend this dancing simulator at all.",0,2024-06-22,PLAYSTATION 4,user
