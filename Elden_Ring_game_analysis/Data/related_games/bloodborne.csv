ENBEST69,"Miyazaki cada vez que saca un juego rompe el gaming, pero Bloodborne es la segunda venida de Dios. Combate frenético, la mejor ambientación de cualquier souls, lore impresionante y aterrador, y el DLC es obligatorio jugarlo que maravilla. La banda sonora no creo que haya que comentar nada. Que no se note que es mi juego favorito.",10,2025-03-12,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Dante_Hotspur,"Simply the best Soulsborne game ever made, and that is counting Elden ring, Combat is faster, challenging and weapons are more creative, the atmosphere is unmatched, taking inspiration from cosmic horror stories like lovecraft, simply one of my favorite games ever,",10,2025-03-06,PLAYSTATION 4,user
shuraaaaaa,"Bloodbourne is an experimental game, but it seems to me that it has an atmosphere and Laura is one of the best creations of Miyazaki, how beautiful the locations in this game are, the bosses are also very beautiful and pretentious, I liked the game",10,2025-03-04,PLAYSTATION 4,user
SaintDantalion,"Bloodborne is my all time favourite game. It's been ten years now, and I still sometimes fall asleep to Hunter's dream videos on YT. If I could find it a fault, it'd be just that there isn't more of it. Relatively few but well varied weapons, and unusual spell options accompany you through a nightmarish trip across a world that feels like (and might be) partly a dream. Endless speculation awaits you at any crossroad, the zones being infinitely detailed, and plain gorgeous. The soundtrack is pitch perfect, accompanying every boss fight and some of the more recondite areas beautifully. It will forever standout as one of the best and most enjoyable games ever made.",10,2025-03-02,PLAYSTATION 4,user
MiguelNery,"Game design bizarramente bonito, trilha sonora muito bem feita, um jogo que não pode faltar para os fãs de soulslike. A dificuldade é mediana, na medida. A história não é explicada logo de cara, a cutscene inicial não explica basicamente nada (diferente dos outros jogos da From Software), ela é contada por descrições de itens, cenários e etc. Não dou uma nota 10 por ter algumas falhas irritantes, o mecanismo de viagem pelas lâmpadas poderia ser como no Dark Souls 3 por exemplo, sem ter que voltar para o Sonho do Caçador. E há problemas na câmera, os bosses cobrem toda a tela.",9,2025-03-01,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Stupa0037,"another good fromsoft game, not much to say other than the so-so blood vial grinding and some bosses are pretty badly made but most of the game is amazing, especially the old hunters dlc",8,2024-10-20,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Laranja3321,"Já faz tempo que me introduzi a saga souls e sempre escutei sobre como Bloodborne era jogão, e bom, é tudo isso que dizem mesmo. Juntar o tema sombrio da from+horror cosmico foi um acerto em cheio, o jeito que direção de arte se apodera desse tema é fabulosa. A lore também é excelente, mas realmente devo pontuar que não satisfaz em sua conclusão. No mais, Bloodborne é uma experiência incrível, e é triste saber que ele continua sendo exclusivo.",9,2025-02-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Black7705,"Bloodborne é simplesmente uma obra prima, a história, o enredo, a interação com esse mundo sombrio, a forma de como esse mundo se comporta, que mesmo que seja muito fantasioso é totalmente crível, uma das se não a melhor experiência que eu já tive em um jogo,no começo fiquei tipo: muito estranho e simples gráficos mais ou menos e batalhas lentas, mas meu Deus, depois que esse jogo engrenou, pqp foi só subida, o finaleu fiquei perplexo, o único jogo que depois que eu zerei eu levantei da cadeira e aplaudi.

profsal,"Bloodborne is a brutal and rewarding action RPG with a dark, gothic atmosphere. The fast-paced combat, eerie world design, and deep lore make it an unforgettable experience. While the difficulty can be punishing, it adds to the thrill of overcoming challenges. Some technical issues and a steep learning curve might turn off casual players, but for those who enjoy a challenge, it's a must-play.",10,2025-02-11,PLAYSTATION 4,user

ZXSth,"While I completely understand that Bloodborne is held in near-reverence by most people who have played it, I could not get into it. Admittedly, I struggled to feel that ""click"" I felt at a certain point, which I experienced with all 3 Dark Souls games - perhaps if I had given it more time, Bloodborne would have done the same. However, I simply did not enjoy how it felt to play this game. While it is a game with clear effort put into its environments, mechanics and combat, it simply was not for me. As such, I only offer my review as a personal one - my experience should not be taken as objective fact. However, I feel that my rating of the game is still worth expressing, and so I have written this with that caveat I mentioned in mind. If you enjoyed the Souls games, you may enjoy Bloodborne - however, the assumption that you absolutely will enjoy it is not a fair one to have, as was the case with me.",5,2025-02-07,PLAYSTATION 4,user

PounceUwU,"I love Fromsoftware games, but Bloodborne is easily their weakest offering. The boss fights are subpar, the blood vial system is inferior to the flask/gourd system, there's less variety in environments, and there's just not that much content compared to their other games. I'm in awe of the Dark Souls series, Sekiro, and Elden Ring, but this one is a massive miss for me.",6,2023-09-20,PLAYSTATION 4,user

La estética es una locura y es muy rica en muchos enemigos pero las bestias las termino sintiendo decepcionantes. En general lo siento muy fácil, ningún jefe me costo mas de 10 intentos y para nada soy bueno en estos juegos. Se nota que este juego cultivo las mejoras en el gameplay de ds3 y el concepto de sekiro pero no me parece a la altura de ninguno de esos 2 juegos. Aunque sin dudas es un juegazo.",9,2025-01-16,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Bhavyo,"Yes, the game is 10 years old, but if you havent played it, do it now. Im playing games since the 80s and i rate Bloodborne in my top 20 All Time List. While other big companies like Blizzard and EA have transformed themselvs into quite s!itty companies, Fromsoft keeps deliverung what the fans want. Bloodborne is a difficult game! But if you are up to the challenge, you will get one of the best fighting game systems ever, a cool setting with interesting subtle environmental story telling, the best weapons in a game ever. Weapons feel so satisfying, its unreal. The boss fights are medium to extremely difficult, but once you are hooked you wont quit since you lay down the ****. The game also has a high replay value and if you are done with the main quest, there is an even more challenging DLC waiting for you.

I know there'd be keyboard king and console crusaders trying to belittle this review but, I've spent 40 dollars just for a barely playable death simulator. 30 frames locked on ps5, clunky movement and just hype and next to no content",3,2024-11-08,PLAYSTATION 4,user
kiozen,"*Bloodborne* is a masterpiece that takes the core mechanics of the Souls games and transforms them into a faster, more aggressive, and deeply horrifying experience. Set in the decaying, gothic city of Yharnam, the game immerses players in a dark, unsettling world filled with intricate details and hidden mysteries. The gothic-Victorian atmosphere is flawlessly executed, with breathtaking art direction that exudes both danger and eerie allure at every turn.Gameplay is one of *Bloodborne*'s defining elements: it forgoes shields and pushes players toward a fast, offensive combat style. The health-regain mechanic encourages an aggressive approach, rewarding players who strike back immediately. The addition of transformable weapons is unique, allowing for versatile combat styles and adding strategic depth. Each boss encounter is intense, featuring iconic designs and movement patterns that demand quick reflexes and thoughtful **** lore of *Bloodborne* is deep and captivating, drawing inspiration from Lovecraftian horror and gradually unfolding through hidden clues and enigmatic NPCs. The sense of isolation and mystery is tangible, creating an engaging narrative experience steeped in **** essence, *Bloodborne* delivers a hauntingly beautiful journey that challenges players while enveloping them in a richly layered and unsettling world.",9,2024-11-06,PLAYSTATION 4,user

skarl,"Desde o seu lançamento em 2015, Bloodborne tem se destacado como um dos melhores jogos que a FromSoftware já lançou, tornando-se um dos meus favoritos junto com Elden Ring. Mais do que apenas um jogo de ação e RPG, Bloodborne é uma aventura envolvente que deixará uma impressão duradoura nos jogadores, combinando um ambiente único, uma história envolvente e um combate intenso que desafiará todos os jogadores. A sua singularidade reside na capacidade de apresentar um mundo gótico e sombrio cheio de segredos, tornando-o uma verdadeira obra-prima.O ambiente de Bloodborne é sem dúvida um dos seus aspectos mais interessantes. Situado na cidade fictícia de Yharnam, o jogo apresenta uma arquitetura semelhante ao Renascimento Gótico, onde edifícios altos e estreitos, becos escuros e catedrais criam uma atmosfera opressiva e sinistra. Cada detalhe do ambiente contribui para a experiência, como a presença persistente da neblina, o som distante dos sinos e os gritos das criaturas escondidas nas sombras. A cidade de Yharnam parece viva e decadente, com uma atmosfera opressiva que faz os jogadores se sentirem vulneráveis a cada passo. A sensação é que Yharnam é uma cidade que exala mistério e ameaça, o que ajuda a manter os jogadores constantemente alerta, como se algo ruim estivesse sempre à espreita.A história de Bloodborne também merece atenção especial. Ao contrário das histórias tradicionais que geralmente apresentam uma sequência de enredo clara e linear, o enredo de Bloodborne é fragmentado e misterioso, forçando os jogadores a desvendar mistérios ao longo do caminho. A trama se desenrola de forma indireta, onde são necessárias conversas com personagens, descrições de objetos e observação do ambiente para entender o que está acontecendo. A história é profunda e envolvente, explorando temas como a busca pela imortalidade, o terror da ficção científica e as implicações dos jogos e do desconhecido. Este estilo único de contar histórias torna o jogo mais interessante, pois exige que os jogadores prestem atenção e explorem. Cada inovação é como uma nova camada de significado que aprimora a experiência e faz de Bloodborne um jogo que é mais do que apenas divertido.Outra característica importante de Bloodborne é o poder de luta dos chefes. Cada chefe é uma entidade única com seus próprios padrões de ataque e estratégias que exigem paciência, habilidade e persistência do jogador. A guerra é como uma batalha de paciência e precisão, onde qualquer erro pode terminar em morte. Não se pode esquecer, por exemplo, da luta contra o Padre Gascoigne, um dos primeiros grandes desafios do jogo, que obriga os jogadores a compreender o ritmo do combate. Outros chefes, como o Órfão de Kos e Lady Maria, oferecem encontros emocionantes que são ao mesmo tempo desafiadores e recompensadores. A sensação de derrotar um chefe é indescritível porque representa a superação de obstáculos e o aprendizado que o jogo proporciona de forma única.Personagens de Bloodborne também desempenham um papel importante na construção do mundo do jogo. De NPCs com origens obscuras a caçadores lendários como Eileen, a Corva, e Gehrman, o Primeiro Caçador, cada um deles adiciona uma camada de profundidade ao mundo de Yharnam. Esses personagens não existem apenas para ajudar ou desafiar o jogador; eles têm motivações e histórias próprias que afetam diretamente o curso dos acontecimentos. Ao interagir com esses personagens, os jogadores ficam imersos em um mundo onde cada figura tem objetivos, dores e segredos. A complexidade desses personagens contribui para que Bloodborne seja uma experiência inesquecível onde cada encontro tem um significado.Concluindo, Bloodborne não é apenas um jogo; é um experimento profundo e revolucionário que combina terror, aventura e mistério em um mundo gótico. Ambientes profundos, narração enigmática, combate intenso e personagens incríveis fazem deste jogo um dos jogos mais completos e envolventes que já joguei. Junto com Elden Ring, Bloodborne é uma das experiências de RPG mais desafiadoras e gratificantes, uma verdadeira obra de arte que merece ser jogada e explorada por todos os jogadores. É uma experiência inesquecível que permanece com os jogadores muito depois do resultado final..",10,2024-10-26,PLAYSTATION 4,user

smasha,"A work of art that combines Gothic and cosmic horror. From the foreboding atmosphere to the epic and edge-of-your-seat bosses, the experience is unforgettable. The music is truly remarkable and some of FromSoftware's greatest work, and it will send chills down your spine with its haunting, powerful, and otherworldly composition. The map is both well-crafted and engaging, and it features a rich and ominous soundscape. The intense, fast-paced combat is thrilling and transforms every battle into a vicious dance of wits and skill. It rewards an aggressive approach, and by seizing the opportunity, you will become the hunter of these ferocious beasts and monstrosities. The Old Hunter expansion, despite being short, is essential because it brings the best fights, weapons, and music to an already flawless experience. My only complaint is the chalice dungeons, which are a bit monotonous and unnecessary, but they're very optional and out of the way, mainly for hardcore fans of the game. A remarkable title that you must have in your collection. In particular, fans of the horror genre will be very pleased.",10,2024-08-19,PLAYSTATION 4,user

brahaj,"Most of the bad reviews are trolls. Theres only one or two actual bad reviews that I can agree with, cons of this game are included. As much as I love this game, the bugs are definitely a problem, same with it being a PS exclusive. The atmosphere is chilling, I love the randomness of not knowing where to go, and the combat is a great time. However, I wish there was a fun way to grind, as fighting the same normal enemies over and over doesn’t appeal too much. It has great skill check bosses, but some gimmick bosses are annoying. However, this was my reintroduction to console gaming after a long break, that still boots it up to 10. When I beat this, I was 13, and reminder: this was my first console game in around 3 years, this also being my first actual souls like/souls game ever. This game isn’t too hard though, if you’re struggling… what can I say except practice and get good? Unless it’s just due to grinding or gimmicky bosses. Then I understand your pain. The DLC is worth it, if you can spare 20$. I would elaborate, but no spoilers.",10,2024-07-28,PLAYSTATION 4,user
jorraptor,"Before I give my opinion I have to say that I completed the game 100%. Now, this game seems to me like one of the most overrated games I have seen in over 25 years of enjoying this hobby. Visually it looks great for a game that came out in 2015. Most weapons are super fun and some bosses feel unique and fun to fight. THE STORY: this game has one of the best lores I've seen in a videogame but the game DOESN'T TELL YOU. Discovering the lore through items, talking with npc or watching videos on youtube is so underwhelming. You give me a cinematic to introduce a boss but not to explain what's going on in this world. wtf? FARMING: every time you die to a boss you have to go back to other areas to collect vials and bullets, after a couple of bosses doing this mechanic I found it annoying AF. I decided to use my cold fragments only to buy items because that was ruining the experience for me. THE WORLD: sometimes you reach to a point where you can't go forward and need to go back to other areas to open a new path, but the game gives 0 clues of where to go next. I don't want the game to point the directions but come on man, at least something.

Etanious,"As a first souls-like Bloodborne is a fantastic entryway into the series. It nails almost every department. Its atmosphere and art style are some of the best I've seen in gaming as it truly encapsulates the gritty Victorian feel and yarhnam feels like a real place with real horrible, bloody, eldritch problems for the hunter to triumph over. Its music has some incredible tracks like the cleric beast and the final boss theme which really nail what there going for. Although a few of the default level tracks can tend to fall short and be forgettable compared to other souls games. Gameplay is fast, aggressive, and visceral. My biggest gripe is you often feel needed to go back through areas over and over again to accumulate healing flasks after boss attempts. Which is certainly not fun. Another problem comes with a lack of direction from the game as you can sort've get lost and not know where your next big objective is. Overall it's still a fantastic game and I would highly recommend to anyone looking to dip their feet in the souls-like genre.",9,2024-07-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user

LCELESTE,"Bloodborne e uma experiência refinada e aprimorada dos jogos anteriores da desenvolvedora, com uma temática pouco explorada em jogos de ação, traz uma narrativa com diversas camadas de profundidade e enigmas cativantes o suficiente para tornar personagens com uma ou duas linhas de diálogo e tão pouco tempo de tela em algo memorável. Sua gameplay e rápida e visceral não deixa tempo para estratégias complexas ou até mesmo respirar entre ataques inimigos. O jogador que estiver disposto a enfrentar o jogo com a mesma agressividade que ele nos trata será muito recompensado. Os gráficos não são impressionantes, mas se destaca em comparação com seus antecessores ou até mesmo jogos mais novos. O jogo brilha mesmo no designer de seus personagens, cenários e em sua trilha sonora que em alguns momentos conta muito mais da história que muitas linhas de testos ou itens deixados pelo mapa do jogo. Em seus aspectos técnicos não posso deixar de ressaltar algumas quedas de desempenho em ambientes específicos ignoradas pela desenvolvedora e um online complexo de mais para se tornar interessante. Bloodborne está longe da perfeição, mas no conjunto narrativa e gameplay ele se destaca entre tantos jogos souls like.

MattHanson12363,"Bloodborne might be one of the finest examples of atmospheric world building that has ever been produced. Every detail just drips with gothic character and builds so much intrigue in what fresh hell has been visited upon the world. Because of its relatively tighter aesthetic and narrative design, the world feels more harmonious than even other FromSoft games. There are really only two major ""factions"" at play, and the level designs perfectly switch between and even blend the two. The gameplay is top notch, though there are a couple chalice dungeon and DLC encounters that feel straight up unfair given the game design. But the game also has the distinction of some of the best and most memorable fights ever made, especially in the DLC. The soundtrack is a masterclass in atmosphere, and some of the boss themes are downright terrifying and fit the lore implications of the battles flawlessly. This is without a doubt one of my favorite games of all time, and I would give so much to go back to a time when I had not yet played it.

FadeOnSight,"What is there to say really? FromSoftware is just a company that has ALWAYS been in their bag. I hate to say that I got into these games so late. I started soulslikes with Elden Ring upon release and was so profoundly moved by the game it convinced me to play the others, going backwards. I am an Xbox user and after completing Sekiro a benevolent friend gave me his old PS4 just so I could play this. Good lord. I could go on for days about the aesthetic. That brooding, gothic, old victorian-esque style that this game has just resonates with my soul. The story is brilliant, the combat is fluid, the DLC was perfect and upped the difficulty that extra notch, that was ~just~ frustrating enough. It was a blast going for platinum with it. I enjoyed every second, and I looked forward to completing the Dark Souls series now after I finish Shadow of the Erdtree.

Soheyl22,"The best thing about Bloodborne is it's world design and it's Gothic Victorian style . We can't see any reused asset in the main game ( except some dungeons ) and all bossfights are a new experience for players . And also we can talk for a lot of time about the music because it is one of the most interesting part of bloodborne and without it's music maybe Bloodborne can't be as much as it's popular today . And about it's gameplay , it was the first time that Fromsoftwere made a souls game with fast fight style . Before that they made Dark souls 1 and Dark souls 2 and Demon's souls ,they're all have slow fight style and in the first time that they made a fast game they were able to made one of the best game in the world . It storytelling is very similar to other souls game that they made before and the players need to progress in the game and check the item description and everything and place all information like a puzzle to understand the story . And it's difficulty made Bloodborne a challenging game and when players play it , they can feel they're playing a special game that lots of people fear to play it and when they finaly finish the game they can feel that tehy are special . Bloodborne has a few different ending that players can choose their own ending . PROBLEMS: It has just some visual and graphics and online playing problems and i think Fromsoftwere can made a game without any problem with a good remake . Some problems that everyone can feel it including the online playing problems , increase the FPS from 30 to 60 , and fix some visual problems and made a game with a new graphic because the main game is for 9 years ago and it graphic is too old for players . Explain about the score : I talked about it's problems but i think it is because Bloodborne has released 9 years ago and having these problems are normal for an old game and i cant decrease it score and my score for Bloodborne is 10 .",10,2024-06-21,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The atmosphere is good but not my type and after some hours just boring. There are no boss weapons and not many blood weapon. The weapons are cool but there are like only 3 weapons that you should play ,because the others are just the same but worse. The bosses are horrible except of gehrman ,really great boss. There are also minor problems: you have to farm your heals ,just boring and bad gamedesign. And the bonfires (here laterns) only port you back to the dream.

Cuauhtemocz,"My favourite game by FromSoftware and the entire ""Souslike"" genre, especially because of the setting and world building, which starts in a Victorian era inspired horror setting - but soon enough turns into more of a muddy, generic Lovecraftian inspired landscape. The story, as you should expect, leaves more questions than answers, it's neither brilliant or engaging, just vague, but that's the point as it at least sets an atmosphere, and the voice actors do a good work. When it comes to the playability, you also can expect a difficult combat in which your foes are much more agile than you, and which main rule is not to be greedy with attacks, the good old ""hit, run (dodge or roll, depending on the foe, and that makes a lot of difference depending on the boss) and hit again"", save your heavy attacks to only a few openings. The parrying in this game is done by shooting an enemy just before their attack, leaving them open for a devastating blow. But these are tricky and limited to how many bullets your weapon has - and if it's not a flamethrower or other spray weapons, which are still useful in specific cases. Certain bosses have certain weaknesses like fire or arcane type damage, as well as resistances, but the game will never tell you which, indeed, the game won't tell you almost anything about anything and you'll have to either learn the hard way through trial or error, or follow a guide, which I'm sure most people who ""love"" these games do. To get my platinum I had to, for otherwise the chances in which ending you're gonna get, and which Chalice dungeons (separate from the story, these dungeons filled with enemies and bosses are only there for you to gather items, accessories and blood echoes or exp points. There are a few trophies which ask you to finish some of those) to grind into, or which NPCs to spare and which ones to kill to get certain items important for the story were dim. This alone cuts half of the fun in exploring, but this genre isn't expected to be fun to begin with, and it's more about feeling rewarding, which this game proved to feel for just more than half of its length at least. Later in the story as you move away from the Cathedral Ward or old Yharnam, it starts to get really boring and uninspired in relation to the previous, more urban Victorian era setting. I also found the lack of trains and farmlands / windmills (some are visible from a distance but can't be accessed) disappointing as it was a defining detail of the Victorian era or gothic horror which this game draws inspiration from. The graphics also aren't great and don't hold up well today at least not as they did ten years back, some areas are purposefully hard to see and it's lamentable how many assets are copied and pasted in certain regions. Still, the DLC (Old Hunters) especially the last part more than make up for it with an incredible new area, and some of the hardest boss fights, if not the hardest I ever experienced in video games. The lack of an ambient music for the open world / levels, despite inherited from other titles, is just lazy, and bugged me as I put gothic (Bob & Barn's MediEvil II & Resurrection soundtrack) or ""dark country"" music to play. The bosses' soundtrack, however, is amazing, even when it only makes a difficult fight even more irritating. There were more than a handful times that my character aimed and shot but the aim didn't work, not to mention the frustrating, unnatural hit boxes of certain bosses, but when you get this game that's what you should expect, FromSoftware spends more time programming bosses than your character and they simply don't care that your character is not only weak but also slow and clumsy, they're here for it. I played it first during the pandemic lockdown in 2020, so it added another layer of bias in favour of this experience. As much as I liked the game (and it's still my favourite ""souls-like""), and played it in a bunch of New Game +s to explore more character builds (and weapons, there are a lot of them though you practically can't upgrade more than two in a single gameplay, what's frustrating, especially since some of the best weapons are found much later in the game), this game is wildly overrated and is in no way a flawless masterpiece. It has a lot of flaws that show, but which are mostly ""forgiven"" in the name of the genre and the difficulty it's know for (other than the lacklustre graphics, interface design and lack of ambient music, of course).",6,2024-05-04,PLAYSTATION 4,user

MetaBones,"Can't express how great this game really is! Bloodborne is many fans' favorite FromSoftware game and it's easy to see why. The environment and atmosphere is unmatched, the gameplay is smooth and more dynamic than other Soulsbourne titles, and every other aspect makes this game a true masterpiece. I do have a few criticisms but they are minor. First, after several playthroughs, I truly believe the beginning of the game is just too difficult. The learning curve is extremely steep and it hurts its chance of keeping players that would love the experience. Second, the chalice dungeons feel like a solid experiment but much more could've been done with them. Thirdly, the 30 fps is a disappointment since 60 would've been much better. Still, your eyes adjust to the motion so it's not too big of a deal. Lastly, there are story elements that would've made the experience better if they weren't so abstract and vague. More clarity would've definitely helped the overall game. I'm used to Dark Souls and the vague storytelling but this might be FromSoftware's most abstract narrative to date. All my criticisms aside, I do feel like a 10 is an appropriate score due to how creatively rich and finely tuned the game is. I loved each area and boss in its own way, I loved every weapon and felt the balance was on point. The trick weapon system was a fantastic choice and the overall experience was one of the most unforgettable gaming experiences I've ever had. Out of all FromSoftware games, I'm most excited to start new playthroughs more than any other title from them. Did I also mention this game has some of the best gaming music of all time? Yeah, I think it does!",10,2024-04-19,PLAYSTATION 4,user

koryme,"I had the misfortune of playing BB for the 1st time after playing ER and just before I beat Lies of P. I was severely dissapointed by this game. I believe a lot of the love for it is thoroughly coated in nostalgia and argue it's not nearly worth a perfect score in 2024. I won't go through the positives but I'll note I liked the atmosphere, music, and some of the level designs. Here are my negatives: - 30fps. It's painful in 2024. I don't understand why they couldn't have at least made it run at 60 on PS5. After playing it too long it hurt my eyes. -Darkness/obscurity - This goes along with the framerate. I had to max the brightness to be able to figure out what was going on in levels and not strain my eyes. - Coldblood items don't tell you how much they give. - Can't warp between lanters. This is huge. What an oversight in an otherwise detailed game. - Elevators - between going back to the hunters dream just to warp somewhere else, and waiting for elevators, I think that was half my run. Zero fun. - No respec. Wtf. I understand a game being challenging but locking a player into bad choices they had no idea they were making 50 hours ago is antiquated game design, even for 2015. - Jumping. Terrible mechanic. Either remove it or make it easier. it's only required once or twice so why even have it? - Farming. Elden Ring did it right with the flasks. Requiring players to farm healing items with the **** lantern system makes for a repetitive grind that isn't fun. - The story was meh. I was spoiled by Lies of P in that it provided the player with a more robust story, as well as plenty of exploration and item descriptions for those who want to delve deeper. I did not enjoy playing for hours and hours to get an extremely vague 1 minute cutscene that provided no real info to a first time player. I have zero interest in ever playing this again so I'd prefer to get a relatively full story on first playthrough. - Messy boss designs. Many bosses were too hard to read (BSB for example). I didn't struggle with most bosses, but I didn't have fun watching all their pieces flail around giving me no info on what attack was coming. - Gestures. I don't know how many times I accidentally sat on the ground or gestured in the middle of a fight. Just like jumping, this crap system is unecessary and easy to accidentally trigger. - Walking. I know I'm spoiled from ER crouching but having to manually slow walk to try to get a visceral was unecessarily difficult. Just make a crouch or toggle walk/run feature. - Save system. I didn't take any points off from this but it felt like a 2005 game with regard to saving, loading, and having to return to the menu. - Just like the story, the systems in the game are obtuse, hard to learn, and convoluted. Similar to a lot of my complaints, this is an artificial difficulty that isn't enjoyable. Just offer some optional tutorial reading. Don't even get me started on the Chalice dungeons. - Color. I understand the use of color in this game but by the end it was all forgettable and blended together. Which gray level was the Chapel? Is that different than the gray ward one? - Sound. Music is great. Enemy and combat sounds are WAY too loud. The entire sound balancing in this game is trash. - Exploration. No map. Convoluted, confusing level design. This combined with the almost non-existent story makes it feel like a game where you just run gauntlets of enemies to farm for pots for boss fights so you can get one sentence of story. I believe a quality remake could take this game to a 9 or so. But in it's current state, playing it in 2024, with the knowledge of how good games like ER and P are, it's difficult to give this anything near a 10.",7,2024-03-19,PLAYSTATION 4,user

nodlimax,I seriously don't understand the high ratings for this game. To me it just feels like a lesser version of the Dark Souls series. Everything just feels bare bones. The gameplay feels off. The writing is just bad and leaves you with nothing to go on with. You get thrown into the game with basically no real background information or general goal. You just see some creepy scenes and then your character will die on the first enemy to then go back and kill it easily a couple of minutes later. You then kind of aimlessly roam around a city to find stuff and some kind of purpose of why you're even doing what you're doing. I managed to find two bosses in that city. That bird monster boss fell on first try and the human-werewolf mix boss fell on third try. Both of these bosses were not really exciting. Also even roaming around these city streets and hearing stuff about hunters and monster I still have no idea what I'm really doing there. Also Bloodborne managed to annoy me with things like its confusing map layout and by making the use of the bonfire mechanic more annoying. You want to teleport to some other spot? Better return to the hub first and then teleport to the next location. Better be sure that it's the right location because each time you teleport to the wrong place you have to add two more loading screens to teleport to the next location. I've heard a few times that Bloodborne supposedly took lessons from predecessor games like Dark Souls 2 and improved the formula. I'm not seeing it though...,4,2024-03-12,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Nevbear1206,"Bloodborne remains one of the most beloved souls-like and PlayStation titles for a multitude of reasons. Year after year, millions of gamers await the announcement of a remaster that would fix the technical and visual issues that plague this game, such as a poor frame rate and low-quality textures. At its core, Bloodborne is still a phenomenal experience, providing the greatest gothic horror world with a massive variety of fascinating characters and enemies. The narrative continues to enlighten fans, with truly incredible storytelling and lore. The soundtrack remains one of the greatest of all time, consisting of elaborate orchestral tracks that are massive in scale and set a prestigious yet ominous tone. Of course, the gameplay remains the strongest aspect of Bloodborne. FromSoftware takes their perfect souls-like combat, making it more aggressive and better suited for enemies of all shapes and sizes. Replacing shields for firearms remains a bold and genius move that fits the feel of the world. While there are several mediocre bosses, the vast majority are phenomenal and immensely iconic to this day. Each system is well-thought-out and immersive, even if the altered healing system remains polarizing. Simply put, Bloodborne is an incredible evolution of the souls-like genre and remains infinitely enjoyable for all PlayStation fans.",10,2023-12-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user

AlphaPale,"At first I wasn't going to write this because Bloodborne already is considered a masterpiece by many. But I see a lot of new ER fans talking smack about one of my favourite games of all time so it's time to put the this cult straight. First off I want to say I love FS games. I enjoy the challenge, and I love ER, for the most part. I do feel though that From's unofficial ""harsh but fair"" mantra takes a nosedive after the capital. BB doesn't have this problem. It has atmosphere, gorgeous environments, intriguing lore and most importantly, great and fair combat almost 97% of the time, with only a few exceptions I won't get into for spoilers sake. BB is all skill. All bosses can be beat with two buttons, the dodge/roll button and the basic attack button. That's it, you don't have to resort to using magic, using a big ass shield (there aren't any, expect one that's used as a gimmick) or summoning an OP clone of yourself to carry you through the game. Before anyone thinks I'm some noob, or that I need to ""git gud"", I can tell you, I am ""gud"" at these games. I don't have to use magic, consumables or summons to beat any of the bosses. I am also not so up Miyazaki's ass that I can't critique any of these games. Bloodborne is almost perfect when it comes to combat, the only thing it's lacking is 60fps. It's bosses won't have unavoidable damage attacks, bs tracking, combos that SOMETIMES are punishable, but SOMETIMES are not, without any indication or tell which one of the two it's going to be, or attacks that will have you looking through reddit or YouTube to look for workarounds. BB and Sekiro are when the series peaked in terms of combat, you can learn the timings, the best positioning, when it's safe to punish, and how to evade any attack without having to sacrifice your firstborne. It's a true Miyazaki masterpiece, without any artificial difficulty, except the defiled chalice. F that place man.",10,2023-12-01,PLAYSTATION 4,user

filippo333,"Bloodborne comes across more frustrating than fun most of the time. The game isn't bad, don't get me wrong, but the fact you have to grind out blood vials and bullets when you're just trying to finish a boss fight comes off extremely tedious. Not to mention, there are a few areas in the game that are trash mob gauntlets; add hunter invaders into the mix, and you have yourself a misery simulator. There are also some serious technical issues with Bloodborne. The most egregious is the frame-rate, 30fps with poor frame-pacing is what you get, making visceral attacks sometimes not trigger correctly. It happens infrequently, but when it does happen you'll feel the pain... Dodging and healing doesn't always register in critical moments of the game, such as in boss fights. Often I have to spam heal or dodge to ensure the player actually does what I intend. This severely harms the gameplay, as it can sometimes feel you're not in full control of your **** game has some well-designed areas and bosses (mostly), the combat is super satisfying too on top of the fantastic atmosphere. The level design is also quite good and similar to Dark Souls 3 with plenty of shortcuts and areas which loop back to a central zone. That's all the good I can say really, Dark Souls 1 and Elden Ring are way better games. For that reason, I can't score Bloodborne any higher than 6/10, it's a better than average game. However, because of the technical and mechanical flaws, it can sometimes make dying feel like it wasn't your fault, which is not the way for example Sekiro or other FromSoft games play. A smooth 60fps experience with good frame-pacing would make me bump the score to a 7/10.",6,2023-11-25,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Keeps combat moving and faster paced than previous soul entries. Bosses are some of the best we've seen in the series, and the tone/ environment is on another level. Realistically I give this game a 9 but score it a 10 to offset Xbot review bombers.

The world building and art direction is amazing, the bosses are fun to fight, the combat gamelplay is wonderful. I enjoyed my time greatly and came to the conclusion that every from software game is the best game. Bloodborne is definitively one of the best game I ever played. I can't expect more from a video game. Exploration is the most fun, from time to time a new difficulty makes you think about a new approach, a new discovery, a different path, until the end of the game, slowly uncovering the world's lore, tranversing it a intense minute-to-minute fight gameplay.",10,2023-09-10,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Yiordanu,"A video game with no negatives; every aspect excels, with a strong emphasis on its setting/atmosphere that immerses you completely in its world. Each scene is a work of art with a distinctive Soulsborne-style world design, but in Bloodborne, this aspect is taken to another level. The gameplay is frantic, aggressive, and, above all, enjoyable, with some fairly high difficulty spikes. If you're not accustomed to this kind of video game, it might be a bit challenging and lead to some frustration, but with a bit of practice and understanding of its mechanics, you can overcome it. When you do conquer these obstacles, it provides a satisfaction and sense of accomplishment that I haven't experienced in any other game.

Augoosetus,"Rating; 9.5 Bloodborne, one of the best souls likes ever to be made, and as expected is from Fromsoftwear. This game has a marvelous atmosphere, which has not been duplicated sense, with Lovecraft spilling out of every corner. The combat is also extremely thrilling, with the game, focusing on making the character faster, all of the combat becomes more fast-paced. This adds a layer of complexity, that allows people to get into and out of combat quickly, while maximizing damage output, as well as using the revenge sort of system, which brings back health for every time you hit an enemy. Bosses as usual, from Fromsoft are also spectacular, and are incredibly thrilling. Weapons are also incredibly varied, with the pistols offering up a fantastic function of perrying. Now when it comes to the negatives, there are a few. Having to farm blood vials is an extreme hindrance to the enjoyment of the game, with me having to multiple times go back and farm for around 15 to 20 minutes to make sure I have enough blood vials. The difficulty also might be a bit much for some people, which will definitely hamper peoples enjoyment of the game, however this is a souls game, and when you get it you should expect that.

ErfanEFS,"I played this game only for 1 hour and I couldn't keep playing it because of the difficulty level it provides. Honestly the difficulty level as a general parameter in a video game, is a real BALANCE that should be set very carefully by the developers. If the game happens to be very easy, it won't be fun enough to play. Also it'll be the same if the game is very hard, it won't be fun enough to play! However that I believe in ""taste of gaming"" which is different for anyone. I have many good friends that actually LOVE this game and especially the difficulty of it. And I won't blame it one them that why you like it?! Because I believe in ""personal taste of gaming"". It's just not my style, I don't like games that are this hard... But it doesn't mean that no one else should love it too! The game is very great in terms of art, graphics, gameplay, mechanisms, level design, story... But I think that it's not balanced in terms of difficulty when you compare it to all other balanced games. And the fact is that ""Souls"" series fans like this kind of hardness! They're fan of this difficulty. So the game is even successful in finding buyers! Which is the final goal of every game and every product. I respect it, I respect those who love it, you won't have to regret if you love it. But it's not the taste of game that I can keep playing! It's not balanced in difficulty and its fans exactly like this unbalanced difficulty!

ParanoydAndroyd,"**** I pre-ordered this day one, and never heard of FromSoftware, or what their games were like. Having said that, I **** at this game, and constantly dying in it kept me from playing **** 8 years. I finally made time for it in April of 2023, and I had so much fun playing that I ended up getting the Platinum trophy, and all trophies in the DLC. This game is highly addicting, all weapons look and feel amazing, AND they all have different primary and alt attacks. The parrying system is tough to get used to, but when it **** it clicks! Everything just feels so satisfying about this game when you finally sink time into it. Thanks to Bloodborne I am now a dedicated FromSoftware fan, and will never doubt their skills in making a solid experience from start to finish. Elden Ring......here I come! Best part about this **** it's a PlayStation 4 Console **** best place to play",10,2023-07-02,PLAYSTATION 4,user

tensioly,"Bloodborne es el mejor souls-like que he jugado y uno de los mejores juegos de toda la historia. Con la dificultad característica de este tipo de juegos, he **** 25 horas (contando el DLC) en pasármelo, una duración perfecta para mi gusto. Lo he jugado con doblaje en inglés, que es sobresaliente, ya que en español me sacaba un poco de la inmersión. From Software consiguió con este RPG de acción acelerar el ritmo de juego al eliminar los escudos característicos de la saga y haciendo un combate mucho más frenético, satisfactorio y divertido de jugar. El diseño de niveles también es de los mejores que he visto en un videojuego. A la perfecta jugabilidad se le añaden unos enemigos variados y con vistosos y extravagantes animaciones y diseños. Estos diseños acompañan al excelso arte del que hace gala el juego, siendo tan grotesco y oscuro que consigue ser precioso. Además, la ambientación victoriana y la mitología de Lovecraft de la que se inspira el juego evocan en el jugador un aura que no había sentido nunca jugando un videojuego. El lore no se queda atrás, siendo para mi por lejos el mejor de la saga (aunque igual de difícil de comprender sin mirar vídeos) y con una construcción compleja, muy interesante y repleta de secretos fascinantes. Debo mencionar también los brillantes efectos de sonido y sobre todo la maravillosa banda sonora que posee, consiguiendo a veces sobreponerse a los propios enfrentamientos contra jefes. Hay que destacar el contenido de la expansión, para mi al mismo nivel que el propio juego o en ocasiones incluso superior. Como sutiles pegas puedo mencionar algún tirón de fps en zonas demandantes y los pocos incentivos que hay para jugar el contenido opcional de las mazmorras del cáliz. En conclusión, Bloodborne es una auténtica obra de arte y se ha convertido en uno de mis juegos favoritos. Lo recomiendo a todo el mundo. 9,9/10 (06/2023)",10,2023-06-06,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The other thing is the level design is really pretty and beautiful but you will get tired of it being the same colour and all being in a gothic Cathedral area. I must say that I really long for some Green Wood. The bosses and enemies at just the right amount of challenge. I will say the relly mechanic is probably the best mechanic in this game and what make it so fun to play The game takes around 6 to 10 hours and is one of the most fun games you have on the PS4 if you have a PS4 play it.",10,2023-05-30,PLAYSTATION 4,user

A must play",10,2023-05-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user
SirFlankBoring,"Just for heads up, I finished all Dark Souls and Elden Ring. That said, I want to talk about Bloodborne. Over the years the Souls franchise has grown on me with each of its main games having a different gameplay objective. In Dark Souls 1 you have the constant feeling of finally overcoming yourself playing a difficult game, exploring a scary world (after all, at any moment you can die and lose everything, scary in that sense). The exploration is immense, insane, farming in this game is just SOMETHING. In Dark Souls 2, you take everything I've said, and put a melancholy setting à la Berserk, with incredible mechanics, weapons, builds, spells and everything else varied than in Dark Souls 1, there are indeed disadvantages such as movement, but that adjusts as you play. In Dark Souls 3 they managed to reach the absolute level of all three games, perfection from start to finish, Hidetaka Miyazaki's magnum opus. Dark Souls 3 refuses to die, it has cutscenes, enemies, BOSSES, and an importance to the world of games that I can't imagine anything even like it; perhaps in terms of importance we can mention the Halo franchise. In Elden Ring they managed to go above and beyond, everything from the voice acting to the open world, the first and the last boss, Elden Ring went beyond everyone's expectations, a singleplayer game whose fame is the envy of Western developers, who in their arrogance and idiocy cannot understand the magnitude of this masterpiece, a replay factor maybe as big as Dark Souls 1, I could spend hours talking about this game. So, we go back to 2014 with Bloodborne, a game built on top of some bad choices that keep it stuck at 30 frames until today. Its style and setting, along with its sad story and depressing endings, have made Bloodborne the game for many. The question here is: Where exactly does it fit into Miyazaki's games? The answer is: Nowhere. Bloodborne is unique, it's visceral, yet... What I see in Bloodborne is that its bosses don't have much emotional appeal (you remember Artorias, right?). Its health item farming system is a bit degraded for those coming from other Miyazaki games, in addition to being extremely easy to break the game's difficulty (I didn't do that, but everyone knows c*mmmfpk-style dungeons). Its parry system is insane but confusing, you don't know which enemies you can parry, but you know you can, which ends up causing most people to just fire a thousand times until the timing is right. Bloodblorne's lore is as impeccable as ever, following a sad but engaging plot, although to know it you'll probably have to watch videos and thus better understand what you're doing in the next gameplay only. Gehrman is a great final boss, yet things like his theme music and steep setting make his level drop in comparison (Nashandra, Soul of Cinder, Radagon...) In summary, I believe that Bloodborne is a solid 7, with its highs above its lows, but always a solid 7 that would certainly have been more successful if ported to other platforms like PC and Xbox (On Xbox it could be running at 60 Frames, as it happened with Dark Souls 3).",7,2023-05-20,PLAYSTATION 4,user

giannis2001,"Bloodborne is a great game overall but I think it's the weakest in the soulsborne series. First of all, the lore of the game is very deep and the story is very interesting . Also, if you like the Lovecraft-dark fantasy-Victorian era theme then you will appreciate the game even more. The environment in very good designed for the theme. Also the combat is good as well and indeed faster paced, although I don't think it's better than the other games, but on the same level. The problems I found in this game for my taste though are: 1) Worst of all. Bosses/enemy designs and moveset. I found most bosses really not interesting and thrilling and their moveset really weird and random. Micolash and Rom are some examples. Sometimes they do oneshots even though most of the times you don't get much damage from them and you can recover. The dlc bosses are very good though. 2) Very linear gameplay. You cant explore many areas at the same time or have the choice to do so at least. 3) Same visuals all over the game. The world design may be great but you pretty much won't see anything else than towns with castles, a forest and a swamp area. However to even out that you can see that each area has some great interconnected shortcuts and roads which promote the exploring of the world, and I love that. 4)No weapon variety. This game has some very interesting weapons to try out but you will mostly use the Hunter's Axe until you get Ludwing's Holy Blade. Which leads me to my next problem. 5) Only one viable build for your first playthrough. The first time you are locked with Strenght build basically. The only weapon that works for a first playthrough is the Hunter's Axe. The others are very average. However, the good weapons for Skill(Dex) /Bloodtinge/Arcane(Magic) builds are all found in late game so you can get better builds only on NG+.. (Another problem which applies for today's players is that there no PS5 patch or upgrade, and no way to play this other than PS.) Those aren't important problems for what the game is - I repeat that the game is very well designed and great overall - but they are problems compared to the other games in the series by my opinion.",8,2023-05-17,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Zero_89,"Best From game to date, amazing fast, visceral gameplay, intriguing Lovecraftian story, awe-inspiring bosses with amazing accompanying OSTs, jaw dropping visual presentation and trick weapons that although scarce are unique and fun to use. The only thing that keeps this game from achieving perfection in my eyes are the Chalice Dungeons. Chalice Dungeons, in case you don't know, are procedurally generated dungeons, that despite being considered extra content, give some amazing rewards, I'll say that they are basically required if you want to PVP at meta level with some specific builds. As you can imagine, most of the time they don't feel coherent and lack that neat level design that's present in the main game, but that's expected considering the nature of randomly generated content.

Combat is a bit more aggressive than other souls games but the transformation mechanic is kinda unique and very useful in itself. Also bloodborne doesn't have a shield mechanic, instead it has a pistol that you can shot just before enemies hit you, so you can knock them out.

AdoMobA,"Pros - fast paced combat that rewards aggression - variety of trick weapons that each has two modes - some of the best boss design in Fromsoft games - beautiful OST - breathtaking atmosphere and visuals - one of the best DLCs in gaming Cons - farming healing items **** - the chalice dungeons are some of the most uninspired content Fromsoft has ever released Bloodborne is a beautiful game that will sink its teeth in you and does not let go until you are spent or triumphant. Creepy visuals allow the game to elevate its Victorian art style to the maximum and the eventual Lovecraftian influence lends itself fantastically to this era. Gone are shields and instead you are told to be as aggressive as possible as any lost health can be regained through the Rally mechanic. Aka, when hit, your health turns yellow, and if you hit them back you recover that health. This pushes maximum levels of aggression from the bosses and forces the player to either match them or drown. The Old Hunters dlc is just a cream of the crop when it comes to additional content, as some of the greatest fights ever made reside in this DLC. Bloodborne is a fantastic gaming experience that should be lauded for its unapologetic brutality yet fair amounts of tools provided to deal with this brutality.",10,2023-03-16,PLAYSTATION 4,user

It ramps up the From Soft formula with faster and more aggressive combat. Designing a game to be challenging and fun, and making the process of learning from failures and progressing fun as well, must be really hard to do, because I can think of few games that nail the fusion of world design and challenge as well as this one does. I have had few experiences as satisfying as getting wrecked by a boss repeatedly at first only to administer a flawless, grade A beat down to them later on. Farming for healing items ****, but otherwise I like how healing works. The DLC is also a must for anyone who enjoys the main game.

After 40 hours of playng (more or less) i can say that is a good game, the lore is easly accesible if you try to identify with the places, the art design and the level design are some of the best that I ever seen, the bosses are really inspired. Gameplay is faster and more immediate than other souls. Now. Problems: framerate, 27-28 fps aren’t acceptable to play a game based on reflexes like this. Loading time is veeeeery damm long and it canbe frustrating if you try lots of time, even if it’s not a bossfight. I can rate this wonderfull game as a 7,8.

dzsimarci,"Bloodborne is an amazing game with it's music atmosphere and combat. Gameplay: The gameplay is incredible and trillling in this game there is not a moment when you can relax in a figth which makes it very bloodpumping. The start of the game when you don't understand the combat very well yet it's very punishing. There wouldn't be a problem with that except the bloodvials whitch is a consumable in the game that you heal with. If you're out then you have to go farming which is sometimes annoying however i didn't have that big of a problem with that, but i wanted to mention it. There are an incredible variety of weapons and builds that you can do as well whitch makes re-playability very good. The boss design is pretty good hoever there are some ""filler"" bosses but the larger number of them are again very good. Story: I read up some of the story and it's interesting, but it defenetly worsens the ability of the player to immerse themselves in the game that the story is not that accessible from the game itself beacuse its that hidden.

LipeHeroty,"For years we saw medieval games with many proposals to entertain the players. Dark Souls series tried to make medieval horror game with a tragic world of fantasy, and it was a good choice, picking up the most ""dark and gruesome part of the human history"", but Bloodborne was different, they choose the Victorian era and that was the best ideia a game ever had. Bloodborne is the perfection between reality and fantasy, creating a convincing world full of lore and really dark fantasy, creating the best horror world horror fantasy to date. The characters, the creatures and the true tragic histories in a world close to apocalypse is fantastic. The variety of weapons and magic is good because they could work with details in every weapon and spell that you can use in the game, creating your specific build towards your weapon of choice. The unique problem with Bloodborne is that it is too dependent of the DLC The Old Hunters, because this DLC brings the best Bosses, maps and challenge of the history of the ""Soul Series""",10,2023-02-09,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Bloodborne reminds me some of the old games which you need to be careful not to die and be careful before approaching to an enemy. Boss fights need tactics, they are hard but there is always an easy way to defeat each of them. Just level up as much as you can by killing same easy npcs and you can see that this game is easy. And learn the paths from youtube walkthroughs if you stuck. Saw cleaver is highly recommended weapon btw and Lone Survivor class is the easiest start for the game.

Redraptor456,"Upon playing FromSoftwares gothic horror masterpiece, Bloodborne, it is immediately apparent that the game is the very definition of a passion project. I don't think I have ever seen a game with a world as detailed and meticulously crafted as Bloodborne. The games environments are as nightmarish as they are beautiful and captivating to explore. The game's cities take heavy inspiration from English Victorian era architecture and it shows. Almost every area in the game is remarkably immersive thanks in part to the stunning art design, and bone chilling sound design. The horrifying sounds of Bloodborne are wrought with disturbing bloodcurdling screams, the menacing growls of werewolfs, and the howls of grotesque beasts. This type of sound design is present in nearly every area, and this, combined with the aforementioned ghoulish architecture, has the effect of making the player constantly tense and on edge in nearly every area. The game's story and dialogue as well as the art design for the characters in the first half of the game also take heavy influence from the works great Victorian horror authors such as Bram Stoker, and Edgar Allan Poe. In the second half, the game becomes much more similar to an H. P. Lovecraft story, with numerous cosmic horror themed imagery and storytelling. This unique style gives the game a sense of personality and identity not present within most games in Bloodborne's genre. It also makes the game feel fresh and distinct from other, more traditional fantasy RPGs. However, if Bloodborne was all style and no substance it would not be considered a masterpiece. Luckily, Bloodborne's gameplay systems are every bit as masterful as it's art and world design. Bloodborne's level design is some of the best in the gaming industry (typical of FromSoftware), with numerous shortcuts, optional paths, and even whole optional areas that greatly reward exploration on the player's part. The varied enemy design and layouts throughout the levels is also top notch. Every area in Bloodborne has it's own unique enemies with movesets completely different from enemies in previous areas. This helps keep players engaged with the game as they uncover new regions. The combat system of Bloodborne is another one of the games major strengths. The main unique feature of Bloodborne's combat system that distinguishes it from FromSoftware's other soulsborne games is it's ""trick weapon"" system. Every weapon in Bloodborne has the ability to transform into an entirely different weapon at will with a completely different moveset from the base weapon. This allows the player to exucute a great variety of combo attacks with there weapon, through switching back and forth between the weapon's two forms. When this system is combined with the fact that every weapon in Bloodborne has a moveset totally unique from any other weapon in the game, and you get a combat system with an immense amount of replayability. It is incredibly fun to test out different weapons on repeat playthroughs and this is one of the main reasons why the game has maintained a consistent playerbase for so many years since it's release. Another unique feature of Bloodborne's combat system is how thoroughly it rewards aggression. Bloodborne features a ""rally"" system which allows the player to gain a portion of health back if struck by an enemy through attacking the enemy in return. Morover, the dodge roll of the Soulsborne games has been replaced with a quickstep dodge with more invincibility frames, encouraging players to dodge into their enemies aggressively. In addition, the shields of the Dark Souls games have been replaced with guns which, when shot at an enemy right before they attack, can stun them, giving the player the opportunity to counter with a high damaging strike known as a ""visceral attack"". All of these combat features reward an aggressive, in your face playstyle which makes the combat of Bloodborne an endless adrenaline rush. The player's knowledge and skill with this combat system is also rigorously tested by Bloodborne's many challenging and creatively designed boss battles. The boss roster of Bloodborne (especially in the highly acclaimed Old Hunters DLC) is phenomenal. Bosses such as Gherman the First Hunter, Ebrietas Daughter of the Cosmos, Father Gascoigne, Ludwig the Holy Blade, Lady Maria, and Orphan of Kos are all some of the greatest bosses I have ever fought. Many of them boast an outstanding combination of stunningly grotesque art design, great dialogue, deeply tragic lore, and challenging attack patterns that reward the aggressive playstyle Bloodborne attempts to cultivate within it's players. Despite how ferocious, monstrous, and aggressive some of the bosses can be, players must learn to overcome their fear and become just as aggressive and ruthless as the bosses if they wish to slay them. Overall, Bloodborne is without a dubt in my mind one of the greatest games I have ever played.",10,2022-12-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Ulriken,"I jumped on Bloodborne right after many hours put into Elden Ring. This makes it my second FromSoft game, and oh boy, what a masterpiece! I played the GOTY edition with DLC on PS5 and it runs perfectly. The game shows some signs of aging in terms of graphics, as expected, but it still looks so immersive and unnerving! The combat, this time, was miles away from what I experienced in Elden Ring, and I actually prefer the former over the later. Not that I'm very skilled at timing my visceral attacks, but the dashes were generous and it took very little to end up at the backside of my adversary or quickstepping away from harm. It was a game of patience and I had lots to spare. The story had the cryptic nature I was expecting from a FromSoft title, but it was intelligible, sort of. The bosses were all memorable, but the one wielding the sword I wanted will forever hold his special place in my heart. Now let me tell you about the soundtrack. It was the best, most high quality soundtrack I ever listened in a videogame. It has standalone value. The dark and somber melancholy meeting a bombastic orchestral rampage filled all my needs of post-gameplay depression.

maluigario,"Dark Souls 3 - Shields + Lovecraft = Bloodborne This game is fast-paced melee combat that rewards aggression far, far more than passivity. You get in there and YOU be the monster that all these horrors fear, not the other way around. The bosses are awesome, greusome nightmare-beasts. Some of rhe monsters and settings skeeve me out and still give me chills. And the DLC is some of the best content in the game, with awesome new weapons and one of the most difficult but most fun boss battles in the entire SoulsBorne set. The one and only mark I have against this game is its ""Chalice Dungeons"", randomly generated content-padding that you NEED to go through to get all the achievements and SHOULD go through if you want the best upgrade materials for your weapons. These areas are tedious, time-consuming, and monotonous. Despite that looming black mark, Bloodborne remains a top 10 game for me, between its fun combat and Lovecraftian worldbuilding.",9,2022-12-05,PLAYSTATION 4,user

martinho_99,"+ Like always supurb complex level design, brilliant looking grim game world with lots of details, impressive aesthetics + really cool combat, a good progression from Dark Souls since it's a lot faster and more dynamic + nice and varied standard enemies + complex and fascinating lore/story + amazing Soundtrack (even better in the DLC) - some of the best parts of the game are in the DLC (areas, bosses, weapons etc.) - although I love From Softwares style of level connection I sometimes had no idea where to go next this time, it's a bit too chaotic in Bloodborne ~ boss fights are only okay overall, only few are very good (Gehrman, Father Gascoigne), most are quite bad (One Reborn, Rom, Witches of Hemwick etc.), at least there are some outstandingly amazing bosses in the DLC. Overall one of From Softwares best games and a must play if you like a good challenge! In my opinion certain highlights are missing in the main game like Sekiro or Elden Ring do offer. At least the DLC offers them. For me it's a 9+, not a complete masterpiece but an outstanding game.",9,2022-10-30,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Archer_11,"My first 10/10 on this website. Superlatives do not do this game justice - imagine peeling an onion and inside the onion is a pretzel made of diamond that on closer examination is in fact a rubik's cube. And that there is no narrator or voiceover explaining everything, all you have to go by are brief interactions with NPCs that understand parts of the story. Couple that with thrilling combat, pulse pounding suspense and some of the most atmospheric level design you have ever seen and you have what i describe as the perfect game. It is of course not literally perfect - there is some quality of life stuff here that is lacking - but as far as the game world is concerned, Fromsoft have outdone themselves. If you're reading this in 2022 or after, do not hesitate. Bloodborne is ageless.",10,2022-10-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user
ZangBang,"86/100 Bloodborne paints a slumbering world cursed, the city of Yharnam twisted by foreign dark forces that mutated its inhabitants plunging everything in an enrapturing nightmarish landscape. The hidden lore contextualizing the setting is a deep one, drawing much inspiration from the works of H.P.Lovecraft for its concepts while choosing profound topics such as the existentialism and religion of a fallen, multifaceted society as thematic pillars. It is a tremendously rich fictional history to study and interpret. The world map, while cohesive, isn't as interconnected as DS1's but displays the exact same level of structural quality as each area leads to the next with a compelling branching map design that often gives the player a lot of diverging paths to choose from, making for an engaging journey, while taking NPCs to a safe heaven punctuates progression while greatly expanding on the lore. Level Design is, as per tradition, exquisitely intricate and dense as it uses hidden ladders, obscure roads, mysterious ledges and elevators to develop on multiple connected layers, requiring careful play to avoid traps and ambushes while rewarding careful exploration with treasures, shortcuts and new areas, with a lot of optional content to discover. Levels are full of varied creatures using widely different attack patterns that are dangerous as they are fast, as Bloodborne's combat puts a lot more emphasis on speed than the other Souls games. Both your and the enemy's movements are quick, their deadliness balanced with the possibility to regain your health through mindful fast retaliation, making strategic play rewarding and further accentuating this tense, feral fighting speed. Weapons aren't as many as DS1, but here each one has two distinct modes providing a unique moveset, offering plenty of room for combo experimentation. The horror element of the setting bleeds in the gameplay through a new survival element, as healing items are now a finite resource. In actuality, this ends up being one of the few major flaws of the game as the less skilled players will often need to resort to tedious grinding to replenish their stock. Another major flaw is the excessive power of some firearms, trivializing a couple of boss fights. Speaking of, the quality of the bosses is mostly great, sparking interesting fights with unique mechanics and multifaceted movesets. If the player will get stuck during their exploration of Yharnam, the game offers the option to generate streamlined dungeons to explore. For what they are, these are surprisingly rich, hosting enemies and bosses both from the main areas as well as exclusive ones, providing a modest but greatly entertaining way to grind levels while experiencing new stuff.",8,2022-10-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user

WowzifXD,"El juego siguiendo la misma fórmula que los demás juegos de la saga, la historia está oculta y a medida que vamos avanzando podremos averiguar más sobre el lore en base a lo que hemos investigado y a veces tendremos que interpretarla a nuestra manera. El combate fue modificado a uno más dinámico y ágil, eliminando los escudos para darnos armas con truco que complementan el gameplay, como también podremos transformarlas para hacerlas más contundentes y mejorar su efectividad contra diversos enemigos. Todavía se conservan la posibilidad de hacer diferentes builds dependiendo de nuestras preferencias aunque lamentablemente hay muy poca variedad de todo en general. Para personas que no se busquen complicar la vida a la hora de decidir esto puede ser bueno, también ahora podremos recuperar una parte de nuestra barra de salud intercambiando golpes con el enemigo, haciendo el combate más frenético de lo que es, la ambientación es muy inmersiva, haciendo sentir una sensación de terror y ansiedad, con el diseño tan espeluznante de sus ubicaciones. A veces estas nos pueden transmitir muchas cosas si prestamos atención, sinceramente bloodborne tiene la mejor ambientación que yo he visto en un videojuego. Y posee un apartado artístico realmente increíble. Hablando sobre su online ahora funciona con campanas que personalmente no me terminan de convencer. También agregaron los calices que funcionan como mazmorras infinitas las cuales pueden alargar la vida del juego al infinito. Pero lamentablemente estas son muy repetitivas y a veces tediosas, y fuera de la posibilidad de farmear no tienen más utilidad. Esto último es algo completamente prescindible que no es necesario a menos que tengas algo de curiosidad.

BrianDavid94,"Quick background on me the reviewer, I tend to like single player games that is heavy on narrative the most. I also play a lot of racing games and use to play multiplayer games in my high school days but now that it's hard for me and my friends to find a good time to link up so now it’s rarer for me to get into a multiplayer game. Up to try any genre of games and sometimes I find something new that I didn't think I'd like. I own a PC (built by me), Xbox One X, Xbox Series X, PS3, PS4, PS5, and a Switch. I prefer Playstation due to their focus on narrative games. For scoring, I’ll be using the Gameinformer review scale and of course influenced by my personal opinions. (9) Superb. Just shy of gaming nirvana, this score is a high recommendation because the game reviewed is head-and-shoulders above its competition. This was the first souls-like game that I ended up beating. All the other games of this genre combat feels delayed of how your character moves in relation to controller input but Bloodborne feels a lot smoother and more responsive. I liked the design for each area except for the swamp. World matches the atmosphere. Just like the other souls games my only gripe is how hidden the story is and makes you do a lot of research to figure out the story.",9,2022-09-12,PLAYSTATION 4,user

BobsityJonesity,"Bloodborne is a game with an uncompromising dark aesthetic style coupled with an interesting modification to the usual fromsoft combat system. It doesn't make sense how this game was released just one year after dark souls 2 and yet feels and looks better in almost every way imaginable. The enemies and bosses are perfectly tuned to fit with the new aggressive gameplay, and the level design feels like a return to form. The only real problem I have is that the game's art style starts to feel samey when nearing the end of the game. However, this is really only a minor complaint, and the rest of the game more than makes up for it. The DLCs also introduce some really compelling bosses that both fit with the themes of the game and extend its combat mechanics even further.",9,2022-08-20,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Devi006,"The best PS4 exclusive and one of the best Games ever made. The Combat is pretty much Perfect, by far the fastest in the series (except Sekiro) which leads to the allow the bosses to be the fastest in the Series. This game now features Guns that you use in you're left Hand while you're Main Weapon remains in your right. When you shoot an Enemy right before it's attack hits you, you'll stagger them and can perform an Visceral attack, brutally ripping you're enemy's guts out, which has to be one of the most satisfying feelings ever. the only gripe I have with it is that the dodge has a lot of Input Lag, though you'll get used to it. I disagree that it has the best Bosses in the Series (that Title goes to Dark Souls III), but some (especially the Final One and the DLC bosses) are some of the best Bosses in the Gaming History. One thing I definitely don't disagree with is that this game has the Best area's out of any Fromsoft game. Maybe there not as connected as they are in Dark Souls 1, but their Design is better IMO and there all flat out gorgeous. While Combat and Music are nearly perfect, the completely Perfect parts of this game remain the atmosphere and Lore. Even if you have no interest in playing the game I recommend you to watch the Story retrospective Gingy (****/watch?v=nD6qsOPTaKQ) and the Lore Videos of for example VaatiVidya (Here's a Playlist: ****/watch?v=wjWOy6ioVHI&list=PLKEHOOuDkS50dNGe1JIVgADO8N0w39yLr). Only if you beat the game or are okay with Spoilers of Course. If you haven't playerd it yet I strongly advise you to, especially if you played one of the other Souls games like Dark Souls or Elden Ring, because, in my Opinion, it is the hardest Game to get into for new players (my Politics Teacher refused to try Elden Ring because he got stuck on the Cleric Beast Im not kidding), but if you like the aesthetic and really want to play this one, there are alot of good Guides on Youtube and when there's a will there's a way, I'm sure you're able to beat Bloodborne, unlike my Politics teacher (If he sees this, and I very much doubt he will, hello Mr. J, I hope you're doing great, you were a very Good Teacher!)

Jdotdeedot,"Bloodborne is the second souls game i've beaten with the first being dark souls 1. I actually played bloodborne first but I quit it and played dark souls 1, then I went back to beat bloodborne. And I don't really know which I prefer, bloodborne easily has the superior combat and graphics while dark souls isn't nearly as grindy and I really didn't iike that they basically forced you to grind in bloodborne. And by grinding I mean grinding/farming for blood vials. I really dislike this feature and it makes it annoying to fight a hard boss because sooner or later you're going to run out of vials so you're forced to grind for them. They really should've made a similar system to the estus flask in dark souls, but oh well what can you do. Storywise I don't have much to say because it's vague just like any other souls game but still very intriguing. I also really love the setting of bloodborne and i like just as much as ds1 but I very much liked how connected the ds1 world is while bloodborne isn't. I know i'm comparing a lot but it's the best way to really sum up how much I like bloodborne. I loved the health regain you can earn after taking damage and then hitting your opponent afterwards. It's very awarding for aggressive players and is a nice change in the souls series. I fairly enjoyed most of the bosses in this game with my least favorite being the one when you have to chase that one guy around the whole freaking building. It's a unique fight but a bit too weird for me. Overall, I really enjoyed bloodborne and I think it's a fantastic game.

The camera can be a mess at times and the chalice dungeons needed more work but these are minor issues compared to what you're getting here. Also, please look into the lore of the game after finishing it. It is possibly the most interesting aspect of the game. It's abstract but also contains emotional depth.

CRM03,"Score: 9.5/10 Is Bloodborne a flawless masterpiece that exceeds expectations in every department? No. Is it an amazing game with fun combat and an interesting world? Yes. I see a lot of people say Bloodborne is the best game ever made and the best Fromsoftware game. While I do see why people would say that, I would have to disagree. Yes it is one of the best games in the Souls series, but it has some minor problems. Some of the boss designs is my major complaint. Some of them just feel annoying and tedious. The chalice dungeons are also pretty repetitive. Complaints aside the game is fantastic. The gameplay is great with it's fast paced nature. The soundtrack is awesome and the world itself is very interesting. Bloodborne is an amazing game, but I wouldn't call it a masterpiece.",9,2022-07-18,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Hiersri,"If any game deserves to be a 10, this is it. Bloodborne offers a unique atmosphere, haunting soundtrack, and remarkably deep and mysterious lore that hooked me in immediately. As with most FromSoftware games, I would argue that this game is not for everyone - it is a somewhat difficult game that requires multiple attempts to master many bosses/areas. The story is also not straightforward, and will require quite a bit of detective work to uncover (by design). In short, this game is a near-flawless experience that succeeds in being exactly what is was meant to be - an immersive, mysterious game that challenges the player.",10,2022-07-07,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The past of the game us much faster than other souls game making sure to note players to be aggressive as you cleave thought enemies and bosses.

Единственное что вызывает отвращение от игры, так это баланс (я считаю, что это проблема всей серии souls-like), его просто не существует. Какую-то часть игры над тобой насмехается каждый крип, другую часть ты несёшься локомотивом по всем боссам(без многочасового фарма, только зачистка лок).

ErayTellezi,"Çocukken Atari'de bitirdiğim Contra'dan beri bitirdiğim en zor oyun oldu. İlk kez bir Souls oyununu bitirdim. Bir süre daha az efor gerektiren oyun oynamam lazım. Bazı boss'ları bir kaç denemede geçerken bazıları saatlerimi aldı. DLC'deki Orphan of Kos'u 6 saatin sonunda yendim. Burada DLC bosslarının daha zor olduğunu söylemliyim. Ana oyunda o kadar da zor bir boss yoktu açıkçası. İlk başta Gascoigne biraz zorladı o da oyunda yeni olduğum için. Her şeyden önce oyunun atmosferi müthiş. Bir bilinmeyenin içinde, tekinsiz bir ortamda geçiyor. Gothic mimariler ve ne olduğu belirsiz deforme olmuş yaratıklarla Bloodborne hakikaten bir korku oyunu. Düşman çeşitliliği ve onların hareket şeması çeşitliliği üst düzey. Oyunu neredeyse tek bir silahla oynamama rağmen hiç sıkılmamamın nedeni de bu çeşitlilik. Her savaşınız bir öncekinden farklı oluyor zira. Oyunda canımız azaldığında hemen düşmana hasar verirsek verdiğimiz hasar ölçüsünde canımızı geri alabiliyoruz. Ben bu mekaniğe bayıldım. Hem hasar aldığınızda sizi defansa değil atağa yönlendiriyor (Doom Eternal gibi) hem de her canınız azaldığında sizi can potu kullanmak zorunda bırakmıyordu. Az canla düşmana saldırıp ölme riski de var tabii ama işin gerilimli ve güzel tarafı da bu zaten. Silah çeşitliliği çok fazla. Her birinin oynanışı inanılmaz farklı değil gibi dursa da vurma süresi ya da açısından dolayı oynanışınızı derinden etkiliyor. Ben bir süre balta ile gittim, sonra Ludwig'in kılıcına geçtim ve onunla da oyunu bitirdim. Oyunda ilk kez gördüğüm bir parry sistemi var. Düşman tam atak yaparken silahla ateş etmek. Parry Ghost of Tsushima'daki gibi elimizdeki kılıçla falan yapılır. Açıkçası çok çok az kullandım diyebilirim. Hem zamanlamasını tutturmak zordu hem de genelde hasar alıyordum. First Hunter boss'unda epey işime yaradı ama. Oyunun en güzel yanlarından birisi de harita dizaynı. Genelde kaybolmuyorsunuz, nereden gideceğinizi biliyorsunuz. Ama bir haritayı diğerine bağlayan ya da az önce birçok düşmanın arasından geçtiğiniz yolu bir daha kullanmanıza gerek kalmayacak bir kestirmeyi açtığınızda inanılmaz rahatlıyorsunuz. Boss'ları yenmekten daha çok tatmin etti diyebilirim. Oyun hiç elinizden tutmuyor. Hızlı koşmayı öğrendiğimde (Aslında rüya bölgesinde bunu söyleyen bir not varmış) ilk 3 boss'u geçmiştim. Arkadan sessiz gelip ağır hasarla rakibi dizlerinin üstüne çökertmeyi taa oyunun sonlarında öğrendim. Oyunun gerçek sonunu görenlerdenim. Moon Presence'i öldürdüm. Tabii bunun için internetin yardımını aldım, yoksa o item'ları asla bulamazdım. Oyunun gıcık olduğum iki özelliği var. Birincisi hikaye anlatımı. Ana oyun (44 saat) + DLC (23 saat) sonunda oyunun hikayesine dair kurabileceğim tek bir cümle yok. Tamam boss tasarımları, atmosfer falan şahane de kimi niye öldürüyoruz, burada nolmuş onu da bilseydik. İlla uzun uzun anlatılsın demiyorum ama bu kadar da ketum olunmaz. Diğeri de yan görevler. sanırım bir kaç tanesini yapabildim. Hiçbir ipucu yok. Kime neyi ne zaman götüreceğiz, ne yapacağız hiç belli değil. Kaçırdığında da geri dönüşü olmuyor çoğu zaman. Bunlar için de yine internete bakmak lazım da ohoo kim uğraşacak. Oyun bittikten sonra labirentlere gireyim dedim, herkese tek attığım için keyif almadım. 5 tanesini bitirdim de çok bir numaraları yokmuş zaten. Özellikle boss savaşı müzikleri şahane. Neticede sevdiğim, keşke biraz daha devam etseydi dediğim ama bir daha asla oynamak istemeyeceğim bir oyun oldu.",9,2022-05-15,PLAYSTATION 4,user
FuriousAegon,"Bloodborne is my personal favorite FromSoft game! Bloodborne for its time was the most fast FromSoft game, without shields, without magic , and because of its success DS3,Sekiro and ER are also very fast, and in-spite of DeS,DS1,DS2 you can really rely on dodges like for a way to avoid damage. Gameplay is very aggressive , because of lore hunters demolish their preys without honor and fight like **** that there no shields (exactly three 2 shiled’s, but it is **** the one in DLC is not bad, but in this point in the game it is still useless ) and there’s new type of weapons - firearms.Different pistols, muskets and so on.Because of this weapons parrying mechanic in Bloodborne is very good and even a new player can be taught how to use firearms and successfully parry ( otherwise player will be forced to learn parries because of Father Gascoigne ). Lore in this game focuses on Healing Church and its blood experiments affected on world, and as a result creating beings called Great One’s.Clearly the main villain in this story is Lawrence, Burgenwerth Student, and friend of Master **** brought old blood teachings to Healing Church, and because of that total chaos started.Lore is very interesting, and if you’re about to play the game - explore every location, read the description of items you find, and the atmosphere will hit you like tsunami and you will be living in this frightening world of Bloodborne. Most of the Bosses in main game are interestingly designed, and have huge lore connections to main events in Bloodborne lore and **** personal favorites are - German, Father Gascoigne, Martyr Logarius,Ebrietas fights with them are memorable and fair ( sometimes Ebrietas doing some crazy frustrating **** such as Lasers that aims directly on player ). DLC is carried by lore connections and boss quality,every boss in dlc is well designed and have connections with lore.Only Orphan of Kos was not enjoyed for **** there’s Ludwig,Maria,Laurence,Failures- these fights are memorable and designed **** these these bosses are **** example Lady Maria is my favorite fight from all FronSoft games, gorgeous design and fight, enormous chunk of lore stands before boss, and cutscene that bring me chills even now after beating the game times **** Laurence and Orphan are the hardest bosses from FromSoft games, and after I beaten Laurence ( Fistly I was playing DLC on NG+++ after beating the game to platinum, that was as pure hell fighting Laurence, every his hit was damaging 80% of my healthbar, I was trying with phantoms but it was no avail, and then I’ve diced to start a new character, and level up as much as I can, get the best gear and best armor and kill this **** yet first 5 attempts was big failure.I was at the brink of **** at my 8th attempt on new character, I’ve beat **** that pleasure,how I was screaming in happiness, it was incomparable to anything in my life ) after a week of struggle I’ve beat him, and I grateful to this game for this challenge, and overcoming it was really hard but rewarding. If we are talking about the minuses - there’s 2 largest types of minuses - Chalice Dungeons and consumable flasks.These minuses are we obvious and for some as large as they can hate this game for, but for me it was bearable. In the end of this large essay I must say that I spent about 160 hours in this game got my platinum, and beat this game times 7-8, and it was my first souls game back in 2019,and it is still my favorite one, only Sekiro is near to Bloodborne by experience, and because of how I love this game I give 10 to this game. 10/10",10,2022-05-13,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Purtroppo il gioco base si ritrova con la maggior parte delle boss fight caotiche e confuse, specialmente quelle contro le bestie giganti di cui si riesce a vedere ben poco durante lo scontro ravvicinato, e quindi è difficile capire cosa stanno per fare durante lo scontro. Lo ritengo un buon gioco ma con dei boss molto deludenti e con attacchi molto simili, e con un ambientazione troppo ripetuta fatta di borghi e foreste e poca reale differenziazione della build del ****.

It's an ugly tunnel runner, combat system is nothing to write home about, especially when you get to fight some over-sized gob in cramped space where can't see crap what's happening because of the mentioned cramped space and the over-sized gob. That's the difficulty of this game, not the dying when fighting difficult enemies. Sure, you die some fighting hordes of mobs too a bit.

Mindkiller7522,"Just as a forward-I have completed Bloodborne in it's entirety and I'm very proud that I was able to do that. That includes all optional areas/bosses and every weapon and item found with every pathway explored. I did have to use an online guide to make sure I didn't miss anything. Now, this was my first FromSoftware game. It looked cool, so despite the difficulty I figured I'd give it a go. It is often described as ""tough but fair"" which is a stretch. Most enemies can kill you in a few hits and are often placed just off camera. Some bosses feel very unfair, but every one can eventually be beaten. Sometimes that just requires hours of grinding and researching the right weapons and builds that work. Not necessarily the best game design, but I can understand why people like the feeling of accomplishment it gives you. The main problems that I have are not as widely advertised. One-You can't pause the game, even when offline. People have lives and it's bad enough to have to be laser focused on a boss battle while your wife is trying to talk to you. Major points off for this unnecessary design decision. Second and most importantly-What starts as a promising and cool story that **** you right in really goes off the rails half way through. I was enthralled by Yarnham's districts and excited to see the Forbidden Woods that hid Byrgenworth College and Cainhurst Castle. Each avenue seemed to have a neat little sub section or shortcut. Then, the game devolves in to dream levels where it's just trying to be more and more gruesome and weird. Nothing feels connected and you just seem to teleport from one place to the next. By the end of the game it is almost required to watch a Youtube video explaining the story and it still makes little sense. It feels way to artsy and self indulgent. I did still put a ton of time into this game and enjoyed quite a bit of it, but i think it gets a lot of high scores that may not mention any flaws except the difficulty. Edit: I decided to change my review score after reading ""The Paleblood Hunt"" by Redgrave. That essay explains the lore of Bloodborne and should absolutely be required reading after finishing the game.

This is probably one of the hardest soulsborne game out their I still remember the 1 boss I died hundred of times and still remember it's name and the really satisfying feeling killing it the moment I mastered how to parry the **** out of it.,9,2022-03-25,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Raios-Rogue,this game is a masterpiece but not a perfect game it has a few flaws the gem farming system is not ideal some gems you can farm for life in the chalice dungeons and never get them the online takes forever to connect to someone bad frame pacing as usual a fromsoftware trade mark present in all fromsoft games the loading times took forever on a base ps4 now it's ideal on PS5 the fact this game doesn't have a PS5 remastered at least is blasphemy this is the game that sold all the ps4's in 2015 and all the ps4 pro's in 2016 people that haven't played any fromsoftware dark souls games bought this game and loved it the pvp in this game is so good the only problem with it is that stupid 30% health penalty when you invade someone your health decreases so dumb and bloodtinge build are just overpowered and broken high level meta pvp ends in one or two hits with the best attack gems in the game Bloodborne is truly a master piece Sekiro is better Sekiro is the second best fromsoftware game ever made Elden Ring is obviously the best fromsoft game ever made. Sekiro won game of the year unlike bloodborne who hasn't won game of the year but Bloodborne is also one of the best games of the century and also deserves game of the year that's facts Sekiro is just better than bloodborne i know some you that are hardcore die hard soulsborne fans like me would disagree and you don't want to hear or accept it but it's facts Sekiro is just better than bloodborne I have platinum bloodborne twice on my seperate account and on my main account as a veteran member of the soulsbourne community i love Bloodborne but Bloodborne is not better than Sekiro. Sekiro is the hardest Fromsoftware game thats facts people.. Sony Playstation what is you doing this game deserves a remake like Demon's souls Bluepoint games your on remake bloodborne and than make bloodborne 2 because its a crime this game is more than 6 years old Bloodborne has to be remaked for PS5 and we dont have a sequel for this game yet its a crime Sony PS you own the IP your going in gamer jail if you dont do a remake on Bloodborne because it has phenomenal boss fights one of the best melee combat in gothic hack slash action games the switching system of weapons is so good enemy variety is so good NPC story is so good the areas you go to are very interesting the art of this game is phenomenal a game you must play on PlayStation,10,2022-03-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user

RaphaelXL,"Seek a ray of light in this miserable world, not the luxury of pampering in a bright world. Fight in the dark, and finally get out of the cage to see the sun, but there is nowhere to escape. It is very difficult to restore a complete world view and restore a unified style of the world. Once completed, it is also shocking. Scary, eerie, sometimes magnificent, sometimes regrettable. Very artistic style. And this is all thanks to the cancellation of the minimap, which allows me to really observe the scene itself, rather than staring at the map. At the same time, it also puts forward higher requirements for scene design to make enough recognition. Let the players gradually become familiar with the scene itself, from the familiar fear of the unfamiliar to being as friendly as their own balcony. Ugly and disgusting feelings occupy the vast majority, but it is because of this that I have the surprise of finding any ray of light. People cannot be amazed all the time, and it is impossible. There is always an upper limit and a lower limit for the balance of human senses. As long as the fluctuation is large enough, shock can be formed. From being unable to defeat the miscellaneous soldiers at the beginning, to overcoming my inner fear and facing the powerful boss, my mind has grown tremendously. This set of logic is exactly what the real me lacks: face the fear, face the challenge, and there is a way out if you face it bravely! The design concepts of various boss battles are very unique. The close-up frontal risk is low and the return is high. The long-distance avoidance of the risk is high and the return is low. It is very easy to die if you open the distance. Active attack is encouraged, and extreme counterattack is also encouraged, and the attack is the defense. Tribute to the Orphan of Kos who killed me a hundred times. I've also gone from being a big fan of Souls games from the very beginning. The various weapons in the game are very simple to look at, but the actual combat is ever-changing and very deep. It is very rewarding to use every move skillfully to resolve and defeat all kinds of perverted enemies. The presence of the plot is very weak, almost imperceptible, there is no clear description, dynamic plot performance. Some only have item descriptions, NPCs talk to themselves, and hidden notes scattered in huge scenes are collectively referred to as clues. To understand the plot, you can only piece it together through clues. There is no standard answer, maybe the real answer is only in Miyazaki Hidetaka's heart, and every player can have his own understanding and his own answer. The game format of Bloodborne has had a profound impact on me, and my acceptance of the game has changed. Many previous game experiences seem to have been shuffled.",10,2022-03-20,PLAYSTATION 4,user
CnPx98,It's a good game and the asphetics looks amazing. The things which I really didn't like thou is the game is capped at 30 FPS and it stacks attacks making it feel different from other souls games. There is also no tutorial so if you haven't played other souls games you probably won't like Bloodborne. You also have no way to tell if your entering a boss arena and you can't leave boss arenas during combat. You mite be doing a scavenger run to level up then it's wasted cos you enter a boss arena and die then loose all your currency. How ever Bloodborne is a really fun and challenging game. The dark and gloomy level design is great. I love the enemies and the bosses. I really wish they would make a PS4 pro update with an FPS fix. I highly recommend players try out another souls game 1st like Dark souls 3 or Demon Souls. This will give players an understanding of the combat system.,8,2022-03-20,PLAYSTATION 4,user

StriderKiwi,"The best PS4 exclusive and arguably one the best Souls games (I slightly prefer Dark Souls 1 but both are masterpieces). Bloodborne is brutal and will challenge players from start to finish but damn is it rewarding. Whether you coop or not, this game is a harrowing and brutal adventure with of the most memorable and frightening bosses I've ever slain. The combat is faster than the other Souls games before it and while I was worried the addition of guns would ruin the combat, they actually don't and I could see some people liking their inclusion, but you can't rely on them per se. Think of this like an unforgiving hack and slash with a very gothic tone. This is worth buying a PS4 to play it and I can't imagine it's expensive anymore.",10,2022-03-13,PLAYSTATION 4,user

bebopi,"On par for my favorite Fromsoftware game, but it's not perfect. I can admit that some of the bosses aren't super fun, or are unfair if not approached carefully (Rom...). Not as many weapons as DS is also a valid point, but I think all the weapons manage to be fun unlike most of the filler weapons in DS. With the couple negatives out of the way, I can talk about why I love this game so much. Firstly it perfects the dodging combat system by making the player faster alongside the bosses. It's a constant tango of exchanging blows, dodging through hard hitting opponents, and ultimately coming out on top. The feeling of triumph over a boss is there even after multiple playthroughs. The setting also really appeals to me. The gothic Victorian areas feel very different from Dark Souls' castles, and as small as it is felt like it gave a huge new breath of life to the game. Its very gray, and I can understand that being a turnaway for people, but I think had the game had more vibrant color sections it wouldn't invoke the same dread and mystery as it does. Which speaking of... One of the huge inspirations for the game is HP Lovecraft. Not a shock to anyone whose even seen footage of the game, but it draws on the inspiration yet doesn't ripoff it. The pursuit of the eldritch truth and the deeper lore of the game always fascinate me even to this day. Overall one of my favorite games, and definitely worth a check for any PS4/5 owner who wants to get into Fromsoftware or a returning Veteran.",9,2022-03-06,PLAYSTATION 4,user

What I don’t like about the game is the story, it never managed to keep me engaged at any point, I always saw myself skipping cutscenes and dialogues, I’ve also never been a fan of the character you control not speaking at all, it’s so lifeless. There were also many repetitive bosses that required the same strategies, there were five that were very unique, fun and badass, I would go even as far as saying some of the best bosses I’ve ever fought, but at the end of the day the other 15 or so bosses were bland and repetitive… they added no rich lore or anything with meaning.

Snowadian,"The world of Bloodborne is so good. Loved the atmosphere and game aesthetics. I enjoyed the games difficulty right up to the bosses. I can't stress enough how much these bosses take away from the game for people who don't play all the time. I went about 20 hours into this game, frustratingly beat several bosses and then finally gave up at around the 20% mark . Difficult gameplay can be enjoyable, especially in a setting like Bloodborne, but unbeatable bosses make the game exhausting and tiresome (Nioh is another example). I'm not saying to remove the bosses at all - it would be nice for a 'boss skip button' for those of us who want to just play the levels or a story mode. Allowing some of us to choose to play on easy takes nothing away from those who love a challenge. Great game hampered by grueling bosses that take the enjoyment right out of it.",8,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Balzari,"Visuals: 8 - Audio: 8 - Fun: 9 - Longevity: 9 - Engagement: 9 - Total Average Score: 9 If you are a fan of 'From Software's', 'Souls Games' ('Demon's Souls', the 'Dark Souls' Trilogy or 'Sekiro') you will love 'Bloodborne'. If you have played any of 'From Software's' 'Souls' games then you can expect more of the same: beautiful yet horrific visuals, haunting and rousing music, varied enemies and epic, fear inducing and punishing boss fights. Having only previously played 'Dark Souls' and 'Dark Souls 2' it did take me quite a few hours to get into 'Bloodborne' for though it is the same as those previously mentioned games, it is also different, with having a 'shoot / parry' move instead of a 'block' move being the biggest difference that took a lot of getting used. Unlike 'Demon's Souls', 'Dark Souls' and 'Sekiro's' visually varied levels, 'Bloodbourne's' Gothic themed areas whilst beautiful are all dark, depressing and foreboding.

brunamarianni,"Bloodborne was my first experience in the souls-like games, and after many deaths and a long learning process, it got absolutely addictive. The story, which is not clearly told, but hidden in the many items and quests, is beautiful and glorious. Full of secrets, paths, and new experiences at each New Game you start, there will always be one item that you didn't know was there, or a new path, or a new dungeon to explore. The possibilities are huge, and even though it seems frustrating loosing so many times for some bosses (or even to some stupid crows - don't let them deceive you, they can and WILL kill you if you give the chance), it is also highly rewarding when you finally beat them, and then it becomes a matter of honor to try it again and make it better! With different strategies to use with your character, amazing weapons for every type of game-play that suits your stile, Bloodborne is certainly a must play game, at least once in your life. If you manage this one, the other souls-like will come naturally! It is beautiful and nice just to walk around the different scenarios (after eliminating all the enemies, of course... ha ha), and not to mention the soundtracks! The Old Hunters expansion is also as great as the main game, certainly also a must have! I hope it will have a sequence one day!",10,2022-02-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user

ZXSth,"While I completely understand that Bloodborne is held in near-reverence by most people who have played it, I could not get into it. Admittedly, I struggled to feel that ""click"" I felt at a certain point, which I experienced with all 3 Dark Souls games - perhaps if I had given it more time, Bloodborne would have done the same. However, I simply did not enjoy how it felt to play this game. While it is a game with clear effort put into its environments, mechanics and combat, it simply was not for me. As such, I only offer my review as a personal one - my experience should not be taken as objective fact. However, I feel that my rating of the game is still worth expressing, and so I have written this with that caveat I mentioned in mind. If you enjoyed the Souls games, you may enjoy Bloodborne - however, the assumption that you absolutely will enjoy it is not a fair one to have, as was the case with me.",5,2025-02-07,PLAYSTATION 4,user

En general lo siento muy fácil, ningún jefe me costo mas de 10 intentos y para nada soy bueno en estos juegos.

While other big companies like Blizzard and EA have transformed themselvs into quite s!itty companies, Fromsoft keeps deliverung what the fans want. Bloodborne is a difficult game! But if you are up to the challenge, you will get one of the best fighting game systems ever, a cool setting with interesting subtle environmental story telling, the best weapons in a game ever. Weapons feel so satisfying, its unreal. The boss fights are medium to extremely difficult, but once you are hooked you wont quit since you lay down the ****. The game also has a high replay value and if you are done with the main quest, there is an even more challenging DLC waiting for you.

kiozen,"*Bloodborne* is a masterpiece that takes the core mechanics of the Souls games and transforms them into a faster, more aggressive, and deeply horrifying experience. Set in the decaying, gothic city of Yharnam, the game immerses players in a dark, unsettling world filled with intricate details and hidden mysteries. The gothic-Victorian atmosphere is flawlessly executed, with breathtaking art direction that exudes both danger and eerie allure at every turn.Gameplay is one of *Bloodborne*'s defining elements: it forgoes shields and pushes players toward a fast, offensive combat style. The health-regain mechanic encourages an aggressive approach, rewarding players who strike back immediately. The addition of transformable weapons is unique, allowing for versatile combat styles and adding strategic depth. Each boss encounter is intense, featuring iconic designs and movement patterns that demand quick reflexes and thoughtful **** lore of *Bloodborne* is deep and captivating, drawing inspiration from Lovecraftian horror and gradually unfolding through hidden clues and enigmatic NPCs. The sense of isolation and mystery is tangible, creating an engaging narrative experience steeped in **** essence, *Bloodborne* delivers a hauntingly beautiful journey that challenges players while enveloping them in a richly layered and unsettling world.",9,2024-11-06,PLAYSTATION 4,user

skarl,"Desde o seu lançamento em 2015, Bloodborne tem se destacado como um dos melhores jogos que a FromSoftware já lançou, tornando-se um dos meus favoritos junto com Elden Ring. Mais do que apenas um jogo de ação e RPG, Bloodborne é uma aventura envolvente que deixará uma impressão duradoura nos jogadores, combinando um ambiente único, uma história envolvente e um combate intenso que desafiará todos os jogadores. A sua singularidade reside na capacidade de apresentar um mundo gótico e sombrio cheio de segredos, tornando-o uma verdadeira obra-prima.O ambiente de Bloodborne é sem dúvida um dos seus aspectos mais interessantes. Situado na cidade fictícia de Yharnam, o jogo apresenta uma arquitetura semelhante ao Renascimento Gótico, onde edifícios altos e estreitos, becos escuros e catedrais criam uma atmosfera opressiva e sinistra. Cada detalhe do ambiente contribui para a experiência, como a presença persistente da neblina, o som distante dos sinos e os gritos das criaturas escondidas nas sombras. A cidade de Yharnam parece viva e decadente, com uma atmosfera opressiva que faz os jogadores se sentirem vulneráveis a cada passo. A sensação é que Yharnam é uma cidade que exala mistério e ameaça, o que ajuda a manter os jogadores constantemente alerta, como se algo ruim estivesse sempre à espreita.A história de Bloodborne também merece atenção especial. Ao contrário das histórias tradicionais que geralmente apresentam uma sequência de enredo clara e linear, o enredo de Bloodborne é fragmentado e misterioso, forçando os jogadores a desvendar mistérios ao longo do caminho. A trama se desenrola de forma indireta, onde são necessárias conversas com personagens, descrições de objetos e observação do ambiente para entender o que está acontecendo. A história é profunda e envolvente, explorando temas como a busca pela imortalidade, o terror da ficção científica e as implicações dos jogos e do desconhecido. Este estilo único de contar histórias torna o jogo mais interessante, pois exige que os jogadores prestem atenção e explorem. Cada inovação é como uma nova camada de significado que aprimora a experiência e faz de Bloodborne um jogo que é mais do que apenas divertido.Outra característica importante de Bloodborne é o poder de luta dos chefes. Cada chefe é uma entidade única com seus próprios padrões de ataque e estratégias que exigem paciência, habilidade e persistência do jogador. A guerra é como uma batalha de paciência e precisão, onde qualquer erro pode terminar em morte. Não se pode esquecer, por exemplo, da luta contra o Padre Gascoigne, um dos primeiros grandes desafios do jogo, que obriga os jogadores a compreender o ritmo do combate. Outros chefes, como o Órfão de Kos e Lady Maria, oferecem encontros emocionantes que são ao mesmo tempo desafiadores e recompensadores. A sensação de derrotar um chefe é indescritível porque representa a superação de obstáculos e o aprendizado que o jogo proporciona de forma única.Personagens de Bloodborne também desempenham um papel importante na construção do mundo do jogo. De NPCs com origens obscuras a caçadores lendários como Eileen, a Corva, e Gehrman, o Primeiro Caçador, cada um deles adiciona uma camada de profundidade ao mundo de Yharnam. Esses personagens não existem apenas para ajudar ou desafiar o jogador; eles têm motivações e histórias próprias que afetam diretamente o curso dos acontecimentos. Ao interagir com esses personagens, os jogadores ficam imersos em um mundo onde cada figura tem objetivos, dores e segredos. A complexidade desses personagens contribui para que Bloodborne seja uma experiência inesquecível onde cada encontro tem um significado.Concluindo, Bloodborne não é apenas um jogo; é um experimento profundo e revolucionário que combina terror, aventura e mistério em um mundo gótico. Ambientes profundos, narração enigmática, combate intenso e personagens incríveis fazem deste jogo um dos jogos mais completos e envolventes que já joguei. Junto com Elden Ring, Bloodborne é uma das experiências de RPG mais desafiadoras e gratificantes, uma verdadeira obra de arte que merece ser jogada e explorada por todos os jogadores. É uma experiência inesquecível que permanece com os jogadores muito depois do resultado final..",10,2024-10-26,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The music is truly remarkable and some of FromSoftware's greatest work, and it will send chills down your spine with its haunting, powerful, and otherworldly composition. The map is both well-crafted and engaging, and it features a rich and ominous soundscape. The intense, fast-paced combat is thrilling and transforms every battle into a vicious dance of wits and skill. It rewards an aggressive approach, and by seizing the opportunity, you will become the hunter of these ferocious beasts and monstrosities. The Old Hunter expansion, despite being short, is essential because it brings the best fights, weapons, and music to an already flawless experience. My only complaint is the chalice dungeons, which are a bit monotonous and unnecessary, but they're very optional and out of the way, mainly for hardcore fans of the game.

As much as I love this game, the bugs are definitely a problem, same with it being a PS exclusive. The atmosphere is chilling, I love the randomness of not knowing where to go, and the combat is a great time. However, I wish there was a fun way to grind, as fighting the same normal enemies over and over doesn’t appeal too much. It has great skill check bosses, but some gimmick bosses are annoying. However, this was my reintroduction to console gaming after a long break, that still boots it up to 10. When I beat this, I was 13, and reminder: this was my first console game in around 3 years, this also being my first actual souls like/souls game ever. This game isn’t too hard though, if you’re struggling… what can I say except practice and get good? Unless it’s just due to grinding or gimmicky bosses. Then I understand your pain. The DLC is worth it, if you can spare 20$. I would elaborate, but no spoilers.",10,2024-07-28,PLAYSTATION 4,user
jorraptor,"Before I give my opinion I have to say that I completed the game 100%. Now, this game seems to me like one of the most overrated games I have seen in over 25 years of enjoying this hobby. Visually it looks great for a game that came out in 2015. Most weapons are super fun and some bosses feel unique and fun to fight. THE STORY: this game has one of the best lores I've seen in a videogame but the game DOESN'T TELL YOU. Discovering the lore through items, talking with npc or watching videos on youtube is so underwhelming. You give me a cinematic to introduce a boss but not to explain what's going on in this world. wtf? FARMING: every time you die to a boss you have to go back to other areas to collect vials and bullets, after a couple of bosses doing this mechanic I found it annoying AF. I decided to use my cold fragments only to buy items because that was ruining the experience for me. THE WORLD: sometimes you reach to a point where you can't go forward and need to go back to other areas to open a new path, but the game gives 0 clues of where to go next. I don't want the game to point the directions but come on man, at least something. Overall it's a good game, fun to play but TO ME this is not even in the top ten of the genre.",6,2024-07-28,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Etanious,"As a first souls-like Bloodborne is a fantastic entryway into the series. It nails almost every department. Its atmosphere and art style are some of the best I've seen in gaming as it truly encapsulates the gritty Victorian feel and yarhnam feels like a real place with real horrible, bloody, eldritch problems for the hunter to triumph over. Its music has some incredible tracks like the cleric beast and the final boss theme which really nail what there going for. Although a few of the default level tracks can tend to fall short and be forgettable compared to other souls games. Gameplay is fast, aggressive, and visceral. My biggest gripe is you often feel needed to go back through areas over and over again to accumulate healing flasks after boss attempts. Which is certainly not fun. Another problem comes with a lack of direction from the game as you can sort've get lost and not know where your next big objective is. Overall it's still a fantastic game and I would highly recommend to anyone looking to dip their feet in the souls-like genre.",9,2024-07-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Cinematic atmosphere, top tier music, great level design and world aesthetic, absorbing lore and fun to learn boss fights. Not even complex, but a thrilling combat flow that as Sekiro never instigates you to use anything else but the basics, and have no need of additional game-breaking tools, buffs and crap to easily get over soporific, mediocre difficulty design as half of Elden Ring can be described.

LCELESTE,"Bloodborne e uma experiência refinada e aprimorada dos jogos anteriores da desenvolvedora, com uma temática pouco explorada em jogos de ação, traz uma narrativa com diversas camadas de profundidade e enigmas cativantes o suficiente para tornar personagens com uma ou duas linhas de diálogo e tão pouco tempo de tela em algo memorável. Sua gameplay e rápida e visceral não deixa tempo para estratégias complexas ou até mesmo respirar entre ataques inimigos. O jogador que estiver disposto a enfrentar o jogo com a mesma agressividade que ele nos trata será muito recompensado. Os gráficos não são impressionantes, mas se destaca em comparação com seus antecessores ou até mesmo jogos mais novos. O jogo brilha mesmo no designer de seus personagens, cenários e em sua trilha sonora que em alguns momentos conta muito mais da história que muitas linhas de testos ou itens deixados pelo mapa do jogo. Em seus aspectos técnicos não posso deixar de ressaltar algumas quedas de desempenho em ambientes específicos ignoradas pela desenvolvedora e um online complexo de mais para se tornar interessante. Bloodborne está longe da perfeição, mas no conjunto narrativa e gameplay ele se destaca entre tantos jogos souls like.

MattHanson12363,"Bloodborne might be one of the finest examples of atmospheric world building that has ever been produced. Every detail just drips with gothic character and builds so much intrigue in what fresh hell has been visited upon the world. Because of its relatively tighter aesthetic and narrative design, the world feels more harmonious than even other FromSoft games. There are really only two major ""factions"" at play, and the level designs perfectly switch between and even blend the two. The gameplay is top notch, though there are a couple chalice dungeon and DLC encounters that feel straight up unfair given the game design. But the game also has the distinction of some of the best and most memorable fights ever made, especially in the DLC. The soundtrack is a masterclass in atmosphere, and some of the boss themes are downright terrifying and fit the lore implications of the battles flawlessly. This is without a doubt one of my favorite games of all time, and I would give so much to go back to a time when I had not yet played it.

FadeOnSight,"What is there to say really? FromSoftware is just a company that has ALWAYS been in their bag. I hate to say that I got into these games so late. I started soulslikes with Elden Ring upon release and was so profoundly moved by the game it convinced me to play the others, going backwards. I am an Xbox user and after completing Sekiro a benevolent friend gave me his old PS4 just so I could play this. Good lord. I could go on for days about the aesthetic. That brooding, gothic, old victorian-esque style that this game has just resonates with my soul. The story is brilliant, the combat is fluid, the DLC was perfect and upped the difficulty that extra notch, that was ~just~ frustrating enough. It was a blast going for platinum with it. I enjoyed every second, and I looked forward to completing the Dark Souls series now after I finish Shadow of the Erdtree.

Soheyl22,"The best thing about Bloodborne is it's world design and it's Gothic Victorian style . We can't see any reused asset in the main game ( except some dungeons ) and all bossfights are a new experience for players . And also we can talk for a lot of time about the music because it is one of the most interesting part of bloodborne and without it's music maybe Bloodborne can't be as much as it's popular today . And about it's gameplay , it was the first time that Fromsoftwere made a souls game with fast fight style . Before that they made Dark souls 1 and Dark souls 2 and Demon's souls ,they're all have slow fight style and in the first time that they made a fast game they were able to made one of the best game in the world . It storytelling is very similar to other souls game that they made before and the players need to progress in the game and check the item description and everything and place all information like a puzzle to understand the story . And it's difficulty made Bloodborne a challenging game and when players play it , they can feel they're playing a special game that lots of people fear to play it and when they finaly finish the game they can feel that tehy are special . Bloodborne has a few different ending that players can choose their own ending . PROBLEMS: It has just some visual and graphics and online playing problems and i think Fromsoftwere can made a game without any problem with a good remake . Some problems that everyone can feel it including the online playing problems , increase the FPS from 30 to 60 , and fix some visual problems and made a game with a new graphic because the main game is for 9 years ago and it graphic is too old for players . Explain about the score : I talked about it's problems but i think it is because Bloodborne has released 9 years ago and having these problems are normal for an old game and i cant decrease it score and my score for Bloodborne is 10 .",10,2024-06-21,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The atmosphere is good but not my type and after some hours just boring. There are no boss weapons and not many blood weapon. The weapons are cool but there are like only 3 weapons that you should play ,because the others are just the same but worse. The bosses are horrible except of gehrman ,really great boss. There are also minor problems: you have to farm your heals ,just boring and bad gamedesign. And the bonfires (here laterns) only port you back to the dream.

Cuauhtemocz,"My favourite game by FromSoftware and the entire ""Souslike"" genre, especially because of the setting and world building, which starts in a Victorian era inspired horror setting - but soon enough turns into more of a muddy, generic Lovecraftian inspired landscape. The story, as you should expect, leaves more questions than answers, it's neither brilliant or engaging, just vague, but that's the point as it at least sets an atmosphere, and the voice actors do a good work. When it comes to the playability, you also can expect a difficult combat in which your foes are much more agile than you, and which main rule is not to be greedy with attacks, the good old ""hit, run (dodge or roll, depending on the foe, and that makes a lot of difference depending on the boss) and hit again"", save your heavy attacks to only a few openings. The parrying in this game is done by shooting an enemy just before their attack, leaving them open for a devastating blow. But these are tricky and limited to how many bullets your weapon has - and if it's not a flamethrower or other spray weapons, which are still useful in specific cases. Certain bosses have certain weaknesses like fire or arcane type damage, as well as resistances, but the game will never tell you which, indeed, the game won't tell you almost anything about anything and you'll have to either learn the hard way through trial or error, or follow a guide, which I'm sure most people who ""love"" these games do. To get my platinum I had to, for otherwise the chances in which ending you're gonna get, and which Chalice dungeons (separate from the story, these dungeons filled with enemies and bosses are only there for you to gather items, accessories and blood echoes or exp points. There are a few trophies which ask you to finish some of those) to grind into, or which NPCs to spare and which ones to kill to get certain items important for the story were dim. This alone cuts half of the fun in exploring, but this genre isn't expected to be fun to begin with, and it's more about feeling rewarding, which this game proved to feel for just more than half of its length at least. Later in the story as you move away from the Cathedral Ward or old Yharnam, it starts to get really boring and uninspired in relation to the previous, more urban Victorian era setting. I also found the lack of trains and farmlands / windmills (some are visible from a distance but can't be accessed) disappointing as it was a defining detail of the Victorian era or gothic horror which this game draws inspiration from. The graphics also aren't great and don't hold up well today at least not as they did ten years back, some areas are purposefully hard to see and it's lamentable how many assets are copied and pasted in certain regions. Still, the DLC (Old Hunters) especially the last part more than make up for it with an incredible new area, and some of the hardest boss fights, if not the hardest I ever experienced in video games. The lack of an ambient music for the open world / levels, despite inherited from other titles, is just lazy, and bugged me as I put gothic (Bob & Barn's MediEvil II & Resurrection soundtrack) or ""dark country"" music to play. The bosses' soundtrack, however, is amazing, even when it only makes a difficult fight even more irritating. There were more than a handful times that my character aimed and shot but the aim didn't work, not to mention the frustrating, unnatural hit boxes of certain bosses, but when you get this game that's what you should expect, FromSoftware spends more time programming bosses than your character and they simply don't care that your character is not only weak but also slow and clumsy, they're here for it. I played it first during the pandemic lockdown in 2020, so it added another layer of bias in favour of this experience. As much as I liked the game (and it's still my favourite ""souls-like""), and played it in a bunch of New Game +s to explore more character builds (and weapons, there are a lot of them though you practically can't upgrade more than two in a single gameplay, what's frustrating, especially since some of the best weapons are found much later in the game), this game is wildly overrated and is in no way a flawless masterpiece. It has a lot of flaws that show, but which are mostly ""forgiven"" in the name of the genre and the difficulty it's know for (other than the lacklustre graphics, interface design and lack of ambient music, of course).",6,2024-05-04,PLAYSTATION 4,user

MetaBones,"Can't express how great this game really is! Bloodborne is many fans' favorite FromSoftware game and it's easy to see why. The environment and atmosphere is unmatched, the gameplay is smooth and more dynamic than other Soulsbourne titles, and every other aspect makes this game a true masterpiece. I do have a few criticisms but they are minor. First, after several playthroughs, I truly believe the beginning of the game is just too difficult. The learning curve is extremely steep and it hurts its chance of keeping players that would love the experience. Second, the chalice dungeons feel like a solid experiment but much more could've been done with them. Thirdly, the 30 fps is a disappointment since 60 would've been much better. Still, your eyes adjust to the motion so it's not too big of a deal. Lastly, there are story elements that would've made the experience better if they weren't so abstract and vague. More clarity would've definitely helped the overall game. I'm used to Dark Souls and the vague storytelling but this might be FromSoftware's most abstract narrative to date. All my criticisms aside, I do feel like a 10 is an appropriate score due to how creatively rich and finely tuned the game is. I loved each area and boss in its own way, I loved every weapon and felt the balance was on point. The trick weapon system was a fantastic choice and the overall experience was one of the most unforgettable gaming experiences I've ever had. Out of all FromSoftware games, I'm most excited to start new playthroughs more than any other title from them. Did I also mention this game has some of the best gaming music of all time?

koryme,"I had the misfortune of playing BB for the 1st time after playing ER and just before I beat Lies of P. I was severely dissapointed by this game. I believe a lot of the love for it is thoroughly coated in nostalgia and argue it's not nearly worth a perfect score in 2024. I won't go through the positives but I'll note I liked the atmosphere, music, and some of the level designs. Here are my negatives: - 30fps. It's painful in 2024. I don't understand why they couldn't have at least made it run at 60 on PS5. After playing it too long it hurt my eyes. -Darkness/obscurity - This goes along with the framerate. I had to max the brightness to be able to figure out what was going on in levels and not strain my eyes. - Coldblood items don't tell you how much they give. - Can't warp between lanters. This is huge. What an oversight in an otherwise detailed game. - Elevators - between going back to the hunters dream just to warp somewhere else, and waiting for elevators, I think that was half my run. Zero fun. - No respec. Wtf. I understand a game being challenging but locking a player into bad choices they had no idea they were making 50 hours ago is antiquated game design, even for 2015. - Jumping. Terrible mechanic. Either remove it or make it easier. it's only required once or twice so why even have it? - Farming. Elden Ring did it right with the flasks. Requiring players to farm healing items with the **** lantern system makes for a repetitive grind that isn't fun. - The story was meh. I was spoiled by Lies of P in that it provided the player with a more robust story, as well as plenty of exploration and item descriptions for those who want to delve deeper. I did not enjoy playing for hours and hours to get an extremely vague 1 minute cutscene that provided no real info to a first time player. I have zero interest in ever playing this again so I'd prefer to get a relatively full story on first playthrough. - Messy boss designs. Many bosses were too hard to read (BSB for example). I didn't struggle with most bosses, but I didn't have fun watching all their pieces flail around giving me no info on what attack was coming. - Gestures. I don't know how many times I accidentally sat on the ground or gestured in the middle of a fight. Just like jumping, this crap system is unecessary and easy to accidentally trigger. - Walking. I know I'm spoiled from ER crouching but having to manually slow walk to try to get a visceral was unecessarily difficult. Just make a crouch or toggle walk/run feature. - Save system. I didn't take any points off from this but it felt like a 2005 game with regard to saving, loading, and having to return to the menu. - Just like the story, the systems in the game are obtuse, hard to learn, and convoluted. Similar to a lot of my complaints, this is an artificial difficulty that isn't enjoyable. Just offer some optional tutorial reading. Don't even get me started on the Chalice dungeons. - Color. I understand the use of color in this game but by the end it was all forgettable and blended together. Which gray level was the Chapel? Is that different than the gray ward one? - Sound. Music is great. Enemy and combat sounds are WAY too loud. The entire sound balancing in this game is trash. - Exploration. No map. Convoluted, confusing level design. This combined with the almost non-existent story makes it feel like a game where you just run gauntlets of enemies to farm for pots for boss fights so you can get one sentence of story. I believe a quality remake could take this game to a 9 or so. But in it's current state, playing it in 2024, with the knowledge of how good games like ER and P are, it's difficult to give this anything near a 10.",7,2024-03-19,PLAYSTATION 4,user

nodlimax,I seriously don't understand the high ratings for this game. To me it just feels like a lesser version of the Dark Souls series. Everything just feels bare bones. The gameplay feels off. The writing is just bad and leaves you with nothing to go on with. You get thrown into the game with basically no real background information or general goal. You just see some creepy scenes and then your character will die on the first enemy to then go back and kill it easily a couple of minutes later. You then kind of aimlessly roam around a city to find stuff and some kind of purpose of why you're even doing what you're doing. I managed to find two bosses in that city. That bird monster boss fell on first try and the human-werewolf mix boss fell on third try. Both of these bosses were not really exciting. Also even roaming around these city streets and hearing stuff about hunters and monster I still have no idea what I'm really doing there. Also Bloodborne managed to annoy me with things like its confusing map layout and by making the use of the bonfire mechanic more annoying. You want to teleport to some other spot? Better return to the hub first and then teleport to the next location. Better be sure that it's the right location because each time you teleport to the wrong place you have to add two more loading screens to teleport to the next location. I've heard a few times that Bloodborne supposedly took lessons from predecessor games like Dark Souls 2 and improved the formula. I'm not seeing it though...,4,2024-03-12,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Nevbear1206,"Bloodborne remains one of the most beloved souls-like and PlayStation titles for a multitude of reasons. Year after year, millions of gamers await the announcement of a remaster that would fix the technical and visual issues that plague this game, such as a poor frame rate and low-quality textures. At its core, Bloodborne is still a phenomenal experience, providing the greatest gothic horror world with a massive variety of fascinating characters and enemies. The narrative continues to enlighten fans, with truly incredible storytelling and lore. The soundtrack remains one of the greatest of all time, consisting of elaborate orchestral tracks that are massive in scale and set a prestigious yet ominous tone. Of course, the gameplay remains the strongest aspect of Bloodborne. FromSoftware takes their perfect souls-like combat, making it more aggressive and better suited for enemies of all shapes and sizes. Replacing shields for firearms remains a bold and genius move that fits the feel of the world. While there are several mediocre bosses, the vast majority are phenomenal and immensely iconic to this day. Each system is well-thought-out and immersive, even if the altered healing system remains polarizing. Simply put, Bloodborne is an incredible evolution of the souls-like genre and remains infinitely enjoyable for all PlayStation fans.",10,2023-12-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Extremamente detalhado com histórias super interessantes desde os NPCs mais secundários até, claro, os personagens principais. Essas são algumas das coisas que tornam este jogo maravilhoso, e claro , não poderia deixar de citar a trilha sonora, a melhor que já ouvi, e uma curiosidade é que por mais que as músicas sejam muitas vezes um coral cantado em latim as letras das músicas contam histórias, de acordo com o Boss você esteja enfrentando é contado um pouco sobre eles.

AlphaPale,"At first I wasn't going to write this because Bloodborne already is considered a masterpiece by many. But I see a lot of new ER fans talking smack about one of my favourite games of all time so it's time to put the this cult straight. First off I want to say I love FS games. I enjoy the challenge, and I love ER, for the most part. I do feel though that From's unofficial ""harsh but fair"" mantra takes a nosedive after the capital. BB doesn't have this problem. It has atmosphere, gorgeous environments, intriguing lore and most importantly, great and fair combat almost 97% of the time, with only a few exceptions I won't get into for spoilers sake. BB is all skill. All bosses can be beat with two buttons, the dodge/roll button and the basic attack button. That's it, you don't have to resort to using magic, using a big ass shield (there aren't any, expect one that's used as a gimmick) or summoning an OP clone of yourself to carry you through the game. Before anyone thinks I'm some noob, or that I need to ""git gud"", I can tell you, I am ""gud"" at these games. I don't have to use magic, consumables or summons to beat any of the bosses. I am also not so up Miyazaki's ass that I can't critique any of these games. Bloodborne is almost perfect when it comes to combat, the only thing it's lacking is 60fps. It's bosses won't have unavoidable damage attacks, bs tracking, combos that SOMETIMES are punishable, but SOMETIMES are not, without any indication or tell which one of the two it's going to be, or attacks that will have you looking through reddit or YouTube to look for workarounds. BB and Sekiro are when the series peaked in terms of combat, you can learn the timings, the best positioning, when it's safe to punish, and how to evade any attack without having to sacrifice your firstborne. It's a true Miyazaki masterpiece, without any artificial difficulty, except the defiled chalice. F that place man.",10,2023-12-01,PLAYSTATION 4,user

filippo333,"Bloodborne comes across more frustrating than fun most of the time. The game isn't bad, don't get me wrong, but the fact you have to grind out blood vials and bullets when you're just trying to finish a boss fight comes off extremely tedious. Not to mention, there are a few areas in the game that are trash mob gauntlets; add hunter invaders into the mix, and you have yourself a misery simulator. There are also some serious technical issues with Bloodborne. The most egregious is the frame-rate, 30fps with poor frame-pacing is what you get, making visceral attacks sometimes not trigger correctly. It happens infrequently, but when it does happen you'll feel the pain... Dodging and healing doesn't always register in critical moments of the game, such as in boss fights. Often I have to spam heal or dodge to ensure the player actually does what I intend. This severely harms the gameplay, as it can sometimes feel you're not in full control of your **** game has some well-designed areas and bosses (mostly), the combat is super satisfying too on top of the fantastic atmosphere. The level design is also quite good and similar to Dark Souls 3 with plenty of shortcuts and areas which loop back to a central zone. That's all the good I can say really, Dark Souls 1 and Elden Ring are way better games. For that reason, I can't score Bloodborne any higher than 6/10, it's a better than average game. However, because of the technical and mechanical flaws, it can sometimes make dying feel like it wasn't your fault, which is not the way for example Sekiro or other FromSoft games play. A smooth 60fps experience with good frame-pacing would make me bump the score to a 7/10.",6,2023-11-25,PLAYSTATION 4,user

It really keeps you playing and impropving your character through the game. The level design, with all its shortcuts, is outstanding and final bosses give you some of the most memorable fights ever. The downside: a cryptic story that doesn't tell too much about the characters and the lore (searching on the Internet shouldn't be a must do to understand and know it). Anyway,this game will always deserve a special spot in my mind).",8,2023-10-17,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Keeps combat moving and faster paced than previous soul entries. Bosses are some of the best we've seen in the series, and the tone/ environment is on another level. Realistically I give this game a 9 but score it a 10 to offset Xbot review bombers.

The world building and art direction is amazing, the bosses are fun to fight, the combat gamelplay is wonderful. I enjoyed my time greatly and came to the conclusion that every from software game is the best game. Bloodborne is definitively one of the best game I ever played. I can't expect more from a video game. Exploration is the most fun, from time to time a new difficulty makes you think about a new approach, a new discovery, a different path, until the end of the game, slowly uncovering the world's lore, tranversing it a intense minute-to-minute fight gameplay.",10,2023-09-10,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Yiordanu,"A video game with no negatives; every aspect excels, with a strong emphasis on its setting/atmosphere that immerses you completely in its world. Each scene is a work of art with a distinctive Soulsborne-style world design, but in Bloodborne, this aspect is taken to another level. The gameplay is frantic, aggressive, and, above all, enjoyable, with some fairly high difficulty spikes. If you're not accustomed to this kind of video game, it might be a bit challenging and lead to some frustration, but with a bit of practice and understanding of its mechanics, you can overcome it. When you do conquer these obstacles, it provides a satisfaction and sense of accomplishment that I haven't experienced in any other game.

Augoosetus,"Rating; 9.5 Bloodborne, one of the best souls likes ever to be made, and as expected is from Fromsoftwear. This game has a marvelous atmosphere, which has not been duplicated sense, with Lovecraft spilling out of every corner. The combat is also extremely thrilling, with the game, focusing on making the character faster, all of the combat becomes more fast-paced. This adds a layer of complexity, that allows people to get into and out of combat quickly, while maximizing damage output, as well as using the revenge sort of system, which brings back health for every time you hit an enemy. Bosses as usual, from Fromsoft are also spectacular, and are incredibly thrilling. Weapons are also incredibly varied, with the pistols offering up a fantastic function of perrying. Now when it comes to the negatives, there are a few. Having to farm blood vials is an extreme hindrance to the enjoyment of the game, with me having to multiple times go back and farm for around 15 to 20 minutes to make sure I have enough blood vials. The difficulty also might be a bit much for some people, which will definitely hamper peoples enjoyment of the game, however this is a souls game, and when you get it you should expect that. Overall, an incredible adventure, which stands out in the realm of souls like games.",10,2023-08-26,PLAYSTATION 4,user

ErfanEFS,"I played this game only for 1 hour and I couldn't keep playing it because of the difficulty level it provides. Honestly the difficulty level as a general parameter in a video game, is a real BALANCE that should be set very carefully by the developers. If the game happens to be very easy, it won't be fun enough to play. Also it'll be the same if the game is very hard, it won't be fun enough to play! However that I believe in ""taste of gaming"" which is different for anyone. I have many good friends that actually LOVE this game and especially the difficulty of it. And I won't blame it one them that why you like it?! Because I believe in ""personal taste of gaming"". It's just not my style, I don't like games that are this hard... But it doesn't mean that no one else should love it too! The game is very great in terms of art, graphics, gameplay, mechanisms, level design, story... But I think that it's not balanced in terms of difficulty when you compare it to all other balanced games. And the fact is that ""Souls"" series fans like this kind of hardness! They're fan of this difficulty. So the game is even successful in finding buyers! Which is the final goal of every game and every product. I respect it, I respect those who love it, you won't have to regret if you love it. But it's not the taste of game that I can keep playing!

ParanoydAndroyd,"**** I pre-ordered this day one, and never heard of FromSoftware, or what their games were like. Having said that, I **** at this game, and constantly dying in it kept me from playing **** 8 years. I finally made time for it in April of 2023, and I had so much fun playing that I ended up getting the Platinum trophy, and all trophies in the DLC. This game is highly addicting, all weapons look and feel amazing, AND they all have different primary and alt attacks. The parrying system is tough to get used to, but when it **** it clicks! Everything just feels so satisfying about this game when you finally sink time into it.

YouKnowWho2020,"I played this after Elden Ring and can honestly say it's better. There is a laser focus on fight or flight, rewarding aggressive playstyle. It's lore is more appealing and less opaque. The only downside is age and that is no fault of the game itself, simply a symptom of the industry.

tensioly,"Bloodborne es el mejor souls-like que he jugado y uno de los mejores juegos de toda la historia. Con la dificultad característica de este tipo de juegos, he **** 25 horas (contando el DLC) en pasármelo, una duración perfecta para mi gusto. Lo he jugado con doblaje en inglés, que es sobresaliente, ya que en español me sacaba un poco de la inmersión. From Software consiguió con este RPG de acción acelerar el ritmo de juego al eliminar los escudos característicos de la saga y haciendo un combate mucho más frenético, satisfactorio y divertido de jugar. El diseño de niveles también es de los mejores que he visto en un videojuego. A la perfecta jugabilidad se le añaden unos enemigos variados y con vistosos y extravagantes animaciones y diseños. Estos diseños acompañan al excelso arte del que hace gala el juego, siendo tan grotesco y oscuro que consigue ser precioso. Además, la ambientación victoriana y la mitología de Lovecraft de la que se inspira el juego evocan en el jugador un aura que no había sentido nunca jugando un videojuego. El lore no se queda atrás, siendo para mi por lejos el mejor de la saga (aunque igual de difícil de comprender sin mirar vídeos) y con una construcción compleja, muy interesante y repleta de secretos fascinantes. Debo mencionar también los brillantes efectos de sonido y sobre todo la maravillosa banda sonora que posee, consiguiendo a veces sobreponerse a los propios enfrentamientos contra jefes. Hay que destacar el contenido de la expansión, para mi al mismo nivel que el propio juego o en ocasiones incluso superior. Como sutiles pegas puedo mencionar algún tirón de fps en zonas demandantes y los pocos incentivos que hay para jugar el contenido opcional de las mazmorras del cáliz. En conclusión, Bloodborne es una auténtica obra de arte y se ha convertido en uno de mis juegos favoritos. Lo recomiendo a todo el mundo. 9,9/10 (06/2023)",10,2023-06-06,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The other thing is the level design is really pretty and beautiful but you will get tired of it being the same colour and all being in a gothic Cathedral area. I must say that I really long for some Green Wood. The bosses and enemies at just the right amount of challenge. I will say the relly mechanic is probably the best mechanic in this game and what make it so fun to play The game takes around 6 to 10 hours and is one of the most fun games you have on the PS4 if you have a PS4 play it.",10,2023-05-30,PLAYSTATION 4,user

SirFlankBoring,"Just for heads up, I finished all Dark Souls and Elden Ring. That said, I want to talk about Bloodborne. Over the years the Souls franchise has grown on me with each of its main games having a different gameplay objective. In Dark Souls 1 you have the constant feeling of finally overcoming yourself playing a difficult game, exploring a scary world (after all, at any moment you can die and lose everything, scary in that sense). The exploration is immense, insane, farming in this game is just SOMETHING. In Dark Souls 2, you take everything I've said, and put a melancholy setting à la Berserk, with incredible mechanics, weapons, builds, spells and everything else varied than in Dark Souls 1, there are indeed disadvantages such as movement, but that adjusts as you play. In Dark Souls 3 they managed to reach the absolute level of all three games, perfection from start to finish, Hidetaka Miyazaki's magnum opus. Dark Souls 3 refuses to die, it has cutscenes, enemies, BOSSES, and an importance to the world of games that I can't imagine anything even like it; perhaps in terms of importance we can mention the Halo franchise. In Elden Ring they managed to go above and beyond, everything from the voice acting to the open world, the first and the last boss, Elden Ring went beyond everyone's expectations, a singleplayer game whose fame is the envy of Western developers, who in their arrogance and idiocy cannot understand the magnitude of this masterpiece, a replay factor maybe as big as Dark Souls 1, I could spend hours talking about this game. So, we go back to 2014 with Bloodborne, a game built on top of some bad choices that keep it stuck at 30 frames until today. Its style and setting, along with its sad story and depressing endings, have made Bloodborne the game for many. The question here is: Where exactly does it fit into Miyazaki's games? The answer is: Nowhere. Bloodborne is unique, it's visceral, yet... What I see in Bloodborne is that its bosses don't have much emotional appeal (you remember Artorias, right?). Its health item farming system is a bit degraded for those coming from other Miyazaki games, in addition to being extremely easy to break the game's difficulty (I didn't do that, but everyone knows c*mmmfpk-style dungeons). Its parry system is insane but confusing, you don't know which enemies you can parry, but you know you can, which ends up causing most people to just fire a thousand times until the timing is right. Bloodblorne's lore is as impeccable as ever, following a sad but engaging plot, although to know it you'll probably have to watch videos and thus better understand what you're doing in the next gameplay only. Gehrman is a great final boss, yet things like his theme music and steep setting make his level drop in comparison (Nashandra, Soul of Cinder, Radagon...) In summary, I believe that Bloodborne is a solid 7, with its highs above its lows, but always a solid 7 that would certainly have been more successful if ported to other platforms like PC and Xbox (On Xbox it could be running at 60 Frames, as it happened with Dark Souls 3).",7,2023-05-20,PLAYSTATION 4,user

giannis2001,"Bloodborne is a great game overall but I think it's the weakest in the soulsborne series. First of all, the lore of the game is very deep and the story is very interesting . Also, if you like the Lovecraft-dark fantasy-Victorian era theme then you will appreciate the game even more. The environment in very good designed for the theme. Also the combat is good as well and indeed faster paced, although I don't think it's better than the other games, but on the same level. The problems I found in this game for my taste though are: 1) Worst of all. Bosses/enemy designs and moveset. I found most bosses really not interesting and thrilling and their moveset really weird and random. Micolash and Rom are some examples. Sometimes they do oneshots even though most of the times you don't get much damage from them and you can recover. The dlc bosses are very good though. 2) Very linear gameplay. You cant explore many areas at the same time or have the choice to do so at least. 3) Same visuals all over the game. The world design may be great but you pretty much won't see anything else than towns with castles, a forest and a swamp area. However to even out that you can see that each area has some great interconnected shortcuts and roads which promote the exploring of the world, and I love that. 4)No weapon variety. This game has some very interesting weapons to try out but you will mostly use the Hunter's Axe until you get Ludwing's Holy Blade. Which leads me to my next problem. 5) Only one viable build for your first playthrough. The first time you are locked with Strenght build basically. The only weapon that works for a first playthrough is the Hunter's Axe. The others are very average. However, the good weapons for Skill(Dex) /Bloodtinge/Arcane(Magic) builds are all found in late game so you can get better builds only on NG+.. (Another problem which applies for today's players is that there no PS5 patch or upgrade, and no way to play this other than PS.) Those aren't important problems for what the game is - I repeat that the game is very well designed and great overall - but they are problems compared to the other games in the series by my opinion.",8,2023-05-17,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Zero_89,"Best From game to date, amazing fast, visceral gameplay, intriguing Lovecraftian story, awe-inspiring bosses with amazing accompanying OSTs, jaw dropping visual presentation and trick weapons that although scarce are unique and fun to use. The only thing that keeps this game from achieving perfection in my eyes are the Chalice Dungeons. Chalice Dungeons, in case you don't know, are procedurally generated dungeons, that despite being considered extra content, give some amazing rewards, I'll say that they are basically required if you want to PVP at meta level with some specific builds. As you can imagine, most of the time they don't feel coherent and lack that neat level design that's present in the main game, but that's expected considering the nature of randomly generated content.

Combat is a bit more aggressive than other souls games but the transformation mechanic is kinda unique and very useful in itself. Also bloodborne doesn't have a shield mechanic, instead it has a pistol that you can shot just before enemies hit you, so you can knock them out.

AdoMobA,"Pros - fast paced combat that rewards aggression - variety of trick weapons that each has two modes - some of the best boss design in Fromsoft games - beautiful OST - breathtaking atmosphere and visuals - one of the best DLCs in gaming Cons - farming healing items **** - the chalice dungeons are some of the most uninspired content Fromsoft has ever released Bloodborne is a beautiful game that will sink its teeth in you and does not let go until you are spent or triumphant. Creepy visuals allow the game to elevate its Victorian art style to the maximum and the eventual Lovecraftian influence lends itself fantastically to this era. Gone are shields and instead you are told to be as aggressive as possible as any lost health can be regained through the Rally mechanic. Aka, when hit, your health turns yellow, and if you hit them back you recover that health. This pushes maximum levels of aggression from the bosses and forces the player to either match them or drown. The Old Hunters dlc is just a cream of the crop when it comes to additional content, as some of the greatest fights ever made reside in this DLC. Bloodborne is a fantastic gaming experience that should be lauded for its unapologetic brutality yet fair amounts of tools provided to deal with this brutality.",10,2023-03-16,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Designing a game to be challenging and fun, and making the process of learning from failures and progressing fun as well, must be really hard to do, because I can think of few games that nail the fusion of world design and challenge as well as this one does. I have had few experiences as satisfying as getting wrecked by a boss repeatedly at first only to administer a flawless, grade A beat down to them later on. Farming for healing items ****, but otherwise I like how healing works. The DLC is also a must for anyone who enjoys the main game. Its so good I imagine most who bought it simply consider it part of the main game anyway.",10,2023-03-06,PLAYSTATION 4,user
thenew3381,"I don’t really know how to rate bloodborne. After 40 hours of playng (more or less) i can say that is a good game, the lore is easly accesible if you try to identify with the places, the art design and the level design are some of the best that I ever seen, the bosses are really inspired. Gameplay is faster and more immediate than other souls. Now. Problems: framerate, 27-28 fps aren’t acceptable to play a game based on reflexes like this. Loading time is veeeeery damm long and it canbe frustrating if you try lots of time, even if it’s not a bossfight. I can rate this wonderfull game as a 7,8. But without the dlc “the old hunters” the game loses a lot. A 7 is ok.",7,2023-03-06,PLAYSTATION 4,user
shewlett95,Without a doubt amongst a handful of the greatest video games I’ve ever played.

Azeemo99,I have nothing to say except: Bad Dark Souls. It has the worst healing system I've ever seen in a video game. What is the point of farming healing potions from enemies?

dzsimarci,"Bloodborne is an amazing game with it's music atmosphere and combat. Gameplay: The gameplay is incredible and trillling in this game there is not a moment when you can relax in a figth which makes it very bloodpumping. The start of the game when you don't understand the combat very well yet it's very punishing. There wouldn't be a problem with that except the bloodvials whitch is a consumable in the game that you heal with. If you're out then you have to go farming which is sometimes annoying however i didn't have that big of a problem with that, but i wanted to mention it. There are an incredible variety of weapons and builds that you can do as well whitch makes re-playability very good. The boss design is pretty good hoever there are some ""filler"" bosses but the larger number of them are again very good. Story: I read up some of the story and it's interesting, but it defenetly worsens the ability of the player to immerse themselves in the game that the story is not that accessible from the game itself beacuse its that hidden.

LipeHeroty,"For years we saw medieval games with many proposals to entertain the players. Dark Souls series tried to make medieval horror game with a tragic world of fantasy, and it was a good choice, picking up the most ""dark and gruesome part of the human history"", but Bloodborne was different, they choose the Victorian era and that was the best ideia a game ever had. Bloodborne is the perfection between reality and fantasy, creating a convincing world full of lore and really dark fantasy, creating the best horror world horror fantasy to date. The characters, the creatures and the true tragic histories in a world close to apocalypse is fantastic. The variety of weapons and magic is good because they could work with details in every weapon and spell that you can use in the game, creating your specific build towards your weapon of choice. The unique problem with Bloodborne is that it is too dependent of the DLC The Old Hunters, because this DLC brings the best Bosses, maps and challenge of the history of the ""Soul Series""",10,2023-02-09,PLAYSTATION 4,user

This game has offensive combat, but you also need to be careful because this is not a hack and slash game. Bloodborne reminds me some of the old games which you need to be careful not to die and be careful before approaching to an enemy. Boss fights need tactics, they are hard but there is always an easy way to defeat each of them. Just level up as much as you can by killing same easy npcs and you can see that this game is easy. And learn the paths from youtube walkthroughs if you stuck. Saw cleaver is highly recommended weapon btw and Lone Survivor class is the easiest start for the game.

Mechanics Combat is really **** you progress,you can find new weapons,and also,unlike other souls games,you can use guns and pistols.Pistols use quicksilver bullets,which can be bought in hunters **** can also heal by using blood vials.Weapons have lots of different attacks and I am sure that you will like it. Graphics Graphics are really nice and gothic.Also atmosphere is wonderful. Areas There are lots of areas to discover and they contain bosses.Enemy-item placements are really nice, exploration is wonderful.I didn't like some areas but it is not a big problem Bosses Bosses are basically beasts and hunters. Others If you want to keep discovering the world,there is a very nice option.Chalice dungeons.Chalice dungeons are big areas with at least 3 layers and 3 bosses.They are created randomly so I recommend playing a dungeon at least 2 times because you can discover new things.Dungeons Are similar and bosses are generally reskinned but I don't think that this is a big problem Pros + +Atmosphere +Areas +Weapons +Moves +Mechanics +Ost Cons- -Some reskinned bosses -some areas are boring -There could be more weapons Score 90",9,2023-01-29,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Redraptor456,"Upon playing FromSoftwares gothic horror masterpiece, Bloodborne, it is immediately apparent that the game is the very definition of a passion project. I don't think I have ever seen a game with a world as detailed and meticulously crafted as Bloodborne. The games environments are as nightmarish as they are beautiful and captivating to explore. The game's cities take heavy inspiration from English Victorian era architecture and it shows. Almost every area in the game is remarkably immersive thanks in part to the stunning art design, and bone chilling sound design. The horrifying sounds of Bloodborne are wrought with disturbing bloodcurdling screams, the menacing growls of werewolfs, and the howls of grotesque beasts. This type of sound design is present in nearly every area, and this, combined with the aforementioned ghoulish architecture, has the effect of making the player constantly tense and on edge in nearly every area. The game's story and dialogue as well as the art design for the characters in the first half of the game also take heavy influence from the works great Victorian horror authors such as Bram Stoker, and Edgar Allan Poe. In the second half, the game becomes much more similar to an H. P. Lovecraft story, with numerous cosmic horror themed imagery and storytelling. This unique style gives the game a sense of personality and identity not present within most games in Bloodborne's genre. It also makes the game feel fresh and distinct from other, more traditional fantasy RPGs. However, if Bloodborne was all style and no substance it would not be considered a masterpiece. Luckily, Bloodborne's gameplay systems are every bit as masterful as it's art and world design. Bloodborne's level design is some of the best in the gaming industry (typical of FromSoftware), with numerous shortcuts, optional paths, and even whole optional areas that greatly reward exploration on the player's part. The varied enemy design and layouts throughout the levels is also top notch. Every area in Bloodborne has it's own unique enemies with movesets completely different from enemies in previous areas. This helps keep players engaged with the game as they uncover new regions. The combat system of Bloodborne is another one of the games major strengths. The main unique feature of Bloodborne's combat system that distinguishes it from FromSoftware's other soulsborne games is it's ""trick weapon"" system. Every weapon in Bloodborne has the ability to transform into an entirely different weapon at will with a completely different moveset from the base weapon. This allows the player to exucute a great variety of combo attacks with there weapon, through switching back and forth between the weapon's two forms. When this system is combined with the fact that every weapon in Bloodborne has a moveset totally unique from any other weapon in the game, and you get a combat system with an immense amount of replayability. It is incredibly fun to test out different weapons on repeat playthroughs and this is one of the main reasons why the game has maintained a consistent playerbase for so many years since it's release. Another unique feature of Bloodborne's combat system is how thoroughly it rewards aggression. Bloodborne features a ""rally"" system which allows the player to gain a portion of health back if struck by an enemy through attacking the enemy in return. Morover, the dodge roll of the Soulsborne games has been replaced with a quickstep dodge with more invincibility frames, encouraging players to dodge into their enemies aggressively. In addition, the shields of the Dark Souls games have been replaced with guns which, when shot at an enemy right before they attack, can stun them, giving the player the opportunity to counter with a high damaging strike known as a ""visceral attack"". All of these combat features reward an aggressive, in your face playstyle which makes the combat of Bloodborne an endless adrenaline rush. The player's knowledge and skill with this combat system is also rigorously tested by Bloodborne's many challenging and creatively designed boss battles. The boss roster of Bloodborne (especially in the highly acclaimed Old Hunters DLC) is phenomenal. Bosses such as Gherman the First Hunter, Ebrietas Daughter of the Cosmos, Father Gascoigne, Ludwig the Holy Blade, Lady Maria, and Orphan of Kos are all some of the greatest bosses I have ever fought. Many of them boast an outstanding combination of stunningly grotesque art design, great dialogue, deeply tragic lore, and challenging attack patterns that reward the aggressive playstyle Bloodborne attempts to cultivate within it's players. Despite how ferocious, monstrous, and aggressive some of the bosses can be, players must learn to overcome their fear and become just as aggressive and ruthless as the bosses if they wish to slay them. Overall, Bloodborne is without a dubt in my mind one of the greatest games I have ever played.",10,2022-12-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Ulriken,"I jumped on Bloodborne right after many hours put into Elden Ring. This makes it my second FromSoft game, and oh boy, what a masterpiece! I played the GOTY edition with DLC on PS5 and it runs perfectly. The game shows some signs of aging in terms of graphics, as expected, but it still looks so immersive and unnerving! The combat, this time, was miles away from what I experienced in Elden Ring, and I actually prefer the former over the later. Not that I'm very skilled at timing my visceral attacks, but the dashes were generous and it took very little to end up at the backside of my adversary or quickstepping away from harm. It was a game of patience and I had lots to spare. The story had the cryptic nature I was expecting from a FromSoft title, but it was intelligible, sort of. The bosses were all memorable, but the one wielding the sword I wanted will forever hold his special place in my heart. Now let me tell you about the soundtrack. It was the best, most high quality soundtrack I ever listened in a videogame. It has standalone value. The dark and somber melancholy meeting a bombastic orchestral rampage filled all my needs of post-gameplay depression. One day I will come back to that hunters dream, and revisit all that abject beauty once more. Until then, this will stay up there with Elden Ring, as one of my favorite titles.",10,2022-12-07,PLAYSTATION 4,user
maluigario,"Dark Souls 3 - Shields + Lovecraft = Bloodborne This game is fast-paced melee combat that rewards aggression far, far more than passivity. You get in there and YOU be the monster that all these horrors fear, not the other way around. The bosses are awesome, greusome nightmare-beasts. Some of rhe monsters and settings skeeve me out and still give me chills. And the DLC is some of the best content in the game, with awesome new weapons and one of the most difficult but most fun boss battles in the entire SoulsBorne set. The one and only mark I have against this game is its ""Chalice Dungeons"", randomly generated content-padding that you NEED to go through to get all the achievements and SHOULD go through if you want the best upgrade materials for your weapons. These areas are tedious, time-consuming, and monotonous.

martinho_99,"+ Like always supurb complex level design, brilliant looking grim game world with lots of details, impressive aesthetics + really cool combat, a good progression from Dark Souls since it's a lot faster and more dynamic + nice and varied standard enemies + complex and fascinating lore/story + amazing Soundtrack (even better in the DLC) - some of the best parts of the game are in the DLC (areas, bosses, weapons etc.) - although I love From Softwares style of level connection I sometimes had no idea where to go next this time, it's a bit too chaotic in Bloodborne ~ boss fights are only okay overall, only few are very good (Gehrman, Father Gascoigne), most are quite bad (One Reborn, Rom, Witches of Hemwick etc.), at least there are some outstandingly amazing bosses in the DLC. Overall one of From Softwares best games and a must play if you like a good challenge! In my opinion certain highlights are missing in the main game like Sekiro or Elden Ring do offer. At least the DLC offers them. For me it's a 9+, not a complete masterpiece but an outstanding game.",9,2022-10-30,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Archer_11,"My first 10/10 on this website. Superlatives do not do this game justice - imagine peeling an onion and inside the onion is a pretzel made of diamond that on closer examination is in fact a rubik's cube. And that there is no narrator or voiceover explaining everything, all you have to go by are brief interactions with NPCs that understand parts of the story. Couple that with thrilling combat, pulse pounding suspense and some of the most atmospheric level design you have ever seen and you have what i describe as the perfect game. It is of course not literally perfect - there is some quality of life stuff here that is lacking - but as far as the game world is concerned, Fromsoft have outdone themselves. If you're reading this in 2022 or after, do not hesitate. Bloodborne is ageless.",10,2022-10-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user
ZangBang,"86/100 Bloodborne paints a slumbering world cursed, the city of Yharnam twisted by foreign dark forces that mutated its inhabitants plunging everything in an enrapturing nightmarish landscape. The hidden lore contextualizing the setting is a deep one, drawing much inspiration from the works of H.P.Lovecraft for its concepts while choosing profound topics such as the existentialism and religion of a fallen, multifaceted society as thematic pillars. It is a tremendously rich fictional history to study and interpret. The world map, while cohesive, isn't as interconnected as DS1's but displays the exact same level of structural quality as each area leads to the next with a compelling branching map design that often gives the player a lot of diverging paths to choose from, making for an engaging journey, while taking NPCs to a safe heaven punctuates progression while greatly expanding on the lore. Level Design is, as per tradition, exquisitely intricate and dense as it uses hidden ladders, obscure roads, mysterious ledges and elevators to develop on multiple connected layers, requiring careful play to avoid traps and ambushes while rewarding careful exploration with treasures, shortcuts and new areas, with a lot of optional content to discover. Levels are full of varied creatures using widely different attack patterns that are dangerous as they are fast, as Bloodborne's combat puts a lot more emphasis on speed than the other Souls games. Both your and the enemy's movements are quick, their deadliness balanced with the possibility to regain your health through mindful fast retaliation, making strategic play rewarding and further accentuating this tense, feral fighting speed. Weapons aren't as many as DS1, but here each one has two distinct modes providing a unique moveset, offering plenty of room for combo experimentation. The horror element of the setting bleeds in the gameplay through a new survival element, as healing items are now a finite resource. In actuality, this ends up being one of the few major flaws of the game as the less skilled players will often need to resort to tedious grinding to replenish their stock. Another major flaw is the excessive power of some firearms, trivializing a couple of boss fights. Speaking of, the quality of the bosses is mostly great, sparking interesting fights with unique mechanics and multifaceted movesets. If the player will get stuck during their exploration of Yharnam, the game offers the option to generate streamlined dungeons to explore. For what they are, these are surprisingly rich, hosting enemies and bosses both from the main areas as well as exclusive ones, providing a modest but greatly entertaining way to grind levels while experiencing new stuff.",8,2022-10-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user

m3ny0,"Bloodborne é um dos grandes acertos da série Souls, pegando várias coisas que seus antecessores fizeram bem e colocando em um ambiente sombrio e fantástico. Por ser bem mais rápido, o jogo te coloca em posição de ataque constante (tanto que não há um escudo padrão para se usar), e te dá poucas opções além de encarar os perigos de frente. Por conta disso é fácil ficar afobado e tentar ir de cara contra tudo, embora o jogo só funcione mesmo quando se consegue jogar com calma, e essa inconstância faz com que muita gente largue mão antes de conseguir entender como o jogo realmente funciona.

WowzifXD,"El juego siguiendo la misma fórmula que los demás juegos de la saga, la historia está oculta y a medida que vamos avanzando podremos averiguar más sobre el lore en base a lo que hemos investigado y a veces tendremos que interpretarla a nuestra manera. El combate fue modificado a uno más dinámico y ágil, eliminando los escudos para darnos armas con truco que complementan el gameplay, como también podremos transformarlas para hacerlas más contundentes y mejorar su efectividad contra diversos enemigos. Todavía se conservan la posibilidad de hacer diferentes builds dependiendo de nuestras preferencias aunque lamentablemente hay muy poca variedad de todo en general. Para personas que no se busquen complicar la vida a la hora de decidir esto puede ser bueno, también ahora podremos recuperar una parte de nuestra barra de salud intercambiando golpes con el enemigo, haciendo el combate más frenético de lo que es, la ambientación es muy inmersiva, haciendo sentir una sensación de terror y ansiedad, con el diseño tan espeluznante de sus ubicaciones. A veces estas nos pueden transmitir muchas cosas si prestamos atención, sinceramente bloodborne tiene la mejor ambientación que yo he visto en un videojuego. Y posee un apartado artístico realmente increíble. Hablando sobre su online ahora funciona con campanas que personalmente no me terminan de convencer. También agregaron los calices que funcionan como mazmorras infinitas las cuales pueden alargar la vida del juego al infinito. Pero lamentablemente estas son muy repetitivas y a veces tediosas, y fuera de la posibilidad de farmear no tienen más utilidad. Esto último es algo completamente prescindible que no es necesario a menos que tengas algo de curiosidad.

BrianDavid94,"Quick background on me the reviewer, I tend to like single player games that is heavy on narrative the most. I also play a lot of racing games and use to play multiplayer games in my high school days but now that it's hard for me and my friends to find a good time to link up so now it’s rarer for me to get into a multiplayer game. Up to try any genre of games and sometimes I find something new that I didn't think I'd like. I own a PC (built by me), Xbox One X, Xbox Series X, PS3, PS4, PS5, and a Switch. I prefer Playstation due to their focus on narrative games. For scoring, I’ll be using the Gameinformer review scale and of course influenced by my personal opinions. (9) Superb. Just shy of gaming nirvana, this score is a high recommendation because the game reviewed is head-and-shoulders above its competition. This was the first souls-like game that I ended up beating. All the other games of this genre combat feels delayed of how your character moves in relation to controller input but Bloodborne feels a lot smoother and more responsive. I liked the design for each area except for the swamp. World matches the atmosphere. Just like the other souls games my only gripe is how hidden the story is and makes you do a lot of research to figure out the story.",9,2022-09-12,PLAYSTATION 4,user

BobsityJonesity,"Bloodborne is a game with an uncompromising dark aesthetic style coupled with an interesting modification to the usual fromsoft combat system. It doesn't make sense how this game was released just one year after dark souls 2 and yet feels and looks better in almost every way imaginable. The enemies and bosses are perfectly tuned to fit with the new aggressive gameplay, and the level design feels like a return to form. The only real problem I have is that the game's art style starts to feel samey when nearing the end of the game. However, this is really only a minor complaint, and the rest of the game more than makes up for it. The DLCs also introduce some really compelling bosses that both fit with the themes of the game and extend its combat mechanics even further.",9,2022-08-20,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Devi006,"The best PS4 exclusive and one of the best Games ever made. The Combat is pretty much Perfect, by far the fastest in the series (except Sekiro) which leads to the allow the bosses to be the fastest in the Series. This game now features Guns that you use in you're left Hand while you're Main Weapon remains in your right. When you shoot an Enemy right before it's attack hits you, you'll stagger them and can perform an Visceral attack, brutally ripping you're enemy's guts out, which has to be one of the most satisfying feelings ever. the only gripe I have with it is that the dodge has a lot of Input Lag, though you'll get used to it. I disagree that it has the best Bosses in the Series (that Title goes to Dark Souls III), but some (especially the Final One and the DLC bosses) are some of the best Bosses in the Gaming History. One thing I definitely don't disagree with is that this game has the Best area's out of any Fromsoft game. Maybe there not as connected as they are in Dark Souls 1, but their Design is better IMO and there all flat out gorgeous. While Combat and Music are nearly perfect, the completely Perfect parts of this game remain the atmosphere and Lore. Even if you have no interest in playing the game I recommend you to watch the Story retrospective Gingy (****/watch?v=nD6qsOPTaKQ) and the Lore Videos of for example VaatiVidya (Here's a Playlist: ****/watch?v=wjWOy6ioVHI&list=PLKEHOOuDkS50dNGe1JIVgADO8N0w39yLr). Only if you beat the game or are okay with Spoilers of Course. If you haven't playerd it yet I strongly advise you to, especially if you played one of the other Souls games like Dark Souls or Elden Ring, because, in my Opinion, it is the hardest Game to get into for new players (my Politics Teacher refused to try Elden Ring because he got stuck on the Cleric Beast Im not kidding), but if you like the aesthetic and really want to play this one, there are alot of good Guides on Youtube and when there's a will there's a way, I'm sure you're able to beat Bloodborne, unlike my Politics teacher (If he sees this, and I very much doubt he will, hello Mr. J, I hope you're doing great, you were a very Good Teacher!)

Jdotdeedot,"Bloodborne is the second souls game i've beaten with the first being dark souls 1. I actually played bloodborne first but I quit it and played dark souls 1, then I went back to beat bloodborne. And I don't really know which I prefer, bloodborne easily has the superior combat and graphics while dark souls isn't nearly as grindy and I really didn't iike that they basically forced you to grind in bloodborne. And by grinding I mean grinding/farming for blood vials. I really dislike this feature and it makes it annoying to fight a hard boss because sooner or later you're going to run out of vials so you're forced to grind for them. They really should've made a similar system to the estus flask in dark souls, but oh well what can you do. Storywise I don't have much to say because it's vague just like any other souls game but still very intriguing. I also really love the setting of bloodborne and i like just as much as ds1 but I very much liked how connected the ds1 world is while bloodborne isn't. I know i'm comparing a lot but it's the best way to really sum up how much I like bloodborne. I loved the health regain you can earn after taking damage and then hitting your opponent afterwards. It's very awarding for aggressive players and is a nice change in the souls series. I fairly enjoyed most of the bosses in this game with my least favorite being the one when you have to chase that one guy around the whole freaking building. It's a unique fight but a bit too weird for me. Overall, I really enjoyed bloodborne and I think it's a fantastic game.

39BAKA,"A FromSoftware game its bound to be difficult and enjoyable which its succeeds in strides, The as all Souls game the deep lore of the games is hidden through text and dialogue which brings about many theories from it. The combat system is fantastic, while the catalog of weapons is vastly smaller compare to other souls game it makes up for that by how unique it is. The past of the game us much faster than other souls game making sure to note players to be aggressive as you cleave thought enemies and bosses. The OST is wonderful and fits the lovecraftian horror of Bloodborne.

agent_sema,"Лучшая игра 2015 года. Я не являюсь фанатом серии souls-like игр, но в этом случае жанр играет важную роль, он способствует появлению веры в опасность внутриигрового мира. Внешний вид локаций, мобов, оружия/брони, боссов это просто 10/10, лор bloodborn'а это просто что-то с чем-то, это по истине уникальный мир. Единственное что вызывает отвращение от игры, так это баланс (я считаю, что это проблема всей серии souls-like), его просто не существует. Какую-то часть игры над тобой насмехается каждый крип, другую часть ты несёшься локомотивом по всем боссам(без многочасового фарма, только зачистка лок). Плюс опять повторюсь что souls игры не приносят мне сильного удовольствия и ""хардкор"" не воспринимаю всерьёз.

ErayTellezi,"Çocukken Atari'de bitirdiğim Contra'dan beri bitirdiğim en zor oyun oldu. İlk kez bir Souls oyununu bitirdim. Bir süre daha az efor gerektiren oyun oynamam lazım. Bazı boss'ları bir kaç denemede geçerken bazıları saatlerimi aldı. DLC'deki Orphan of Kos'u 6 saatin sonunda yendim. Burada DLC bosslarının daha zor olduğunu söylemliyim. Ana oyunda o kadar da zor bir boss yoktu açıkçası. İlk başta Gascoigne biraz zorladı o da oyunda yeni olduğum için. Her şeyden önce oyunun atmosferi müthiş. Bir bilinmeyenin içinde, tekinsiz bir ortamda geçiyor. Gothic mimariler ve ne olduğu belirsiz deforme olmuş yaratıklarla Bloodborne hakikaten bir korku oyunu. Düşman çeşitliliği ve onların hareket şeması çeşitliliği üst düzey. Oyunu neredeyse tek bir silahla oynamama rağmen hiç sıkılmamamın nedeni de bu çeşitlilik. Her savaşınız bir öncekinden farklı oluyor zira. Oyunda canımız azaldığında hemen düşmana hasar verirsek verdiğimiz hasar ölçüsünde canımızı geri alabiliyoruz. Ben bu mekaniğe bayıldım. Hem hasar aldığınızda sizi defansa değil atağa yönlendiriyor (Doom Eternal gibi) hem de her canınız azaldığında sizi can potu kullanmak zorunda bırakmıyordu. Az canla düşmana saldırıp ölme riski de var tabii ama işin gerilimli ve güzel tarafı da bu zaten. Silah çeşitliliği çok fazla. Her birinin oynanışı inanılmaz farklı değil gibi dursa da vurma süresi ya da açısından dolayı oynanışınızı derinden etkiliyor. Ben bir süre balta ile gittim, sonra Ludwig'in kılıcına geçtim ve onunla da oyunu bitirdim. Oyunda ilk kez gördüğüm bir parry sistemi var. Düşman tam atak yaparken silahla ateş etmek. Parry Ghost of Tsushima'daki gibi elimizdeki kılıçla falan yapılır. Açıkçası çok çok az kullandım diyebilirim. Hem zamanlamasını tutturmak zordu hem de genelde hasar alıyordum. First Hunter boss'unda epey işime yaradı ama. Oyunun en güzel yanlarından birisi de harita dizaynı. Genelde kaybolmuyorsunuz, nereden gideceğinizi biliyorsunuz. Ama bir haritayı diğerine bağlayan ya da az önce birçok düşmanın arasından geçtiğiniz yolu bir daha kullanmanıza gerek kalmayacak bir kestirmeyi açtığınızda inanılmaz rahatlıyorsunuz. Boss'ları yenmekten daha çok tatmin etti diyebilirim. Oyun hiç elinizden tutmuyor. Hızlı koşmayı öğrendiğimde (Aslında rüya bölgesinde bunu söyleyen bir not varmış) ilk 3 boss'u geçmiştim. Arkadan sessiz gelip ağır hasarla rakibi dizlerinin üstüne çökertmeyi taa oyunun sonlarında öğrendim. Oyunun gerçek sonunu görenlerdenim. Moon Presence'i öldürdüm. Tabii bunun için internetin yardımını aldım, yoksa o item'ları asla bulamazdım. Oyunun gıcık olduğum iki özelliği var. Birincisi hikaye anlatımı. Ana oyun (44 saat) + DLC (23 saat) sonunda oyunun hikayesine dair kurabileceğim tek bir cümle yok. Tamam boss tasarımları, atmosfer falan şahane de kimi niye öldürüyoruz, burada nolmuş onu da bilseydik. İlla uzun uzun anlatılsın demiyorum ama bu kadar da ketum olunmaz. Diğeri de yan görevler. sanırım bir kaç tanesini yapabildim. Hiçbir ipucu yok. Kime neyi ne zaman götüreceğiz, ne yapacağız hiç belli değil. Kaçırdığında da geri dönüşü olmuyor çoğu zaman. Bunlar için de yine internete bakmak lazım da ohoo kim uğraşacak. Oyun bittikten sonra labirentlere gireyim dedim, herkese tek attığım için keyif almadım. 5 tanesini bitirdim de çok bir numaraları yokmuş zaten. Özellikle boss savaşı müzikleri şahane. Neticede sevdiğim, keşke biraz daha devam etseydi dediğim ama bir daha asla oynamak istemeyeceğim bir oyun oldu.",9,2022-05-15,PLAYSTATION 4,user
FuriousAegon,"Bloodborne is my personal favorite FromSoft game! Bloodborne for its time was the most fast FromSoft game, without shields, without magic , and because of its success DS3,Sekiro and ER are also very fast, and in-spite of DeS,DS1,DS2 you can really rely on dodges like for a way to avoid damage. Gameplay is very aggressive , because of lore hunters demolish their preys without honor and fight like **** that there no shields (exactly three 2 shiled’s, but it is **** the one in DLC is not bad, but in this point in the game it is still useless ) and there’s new type of weapons - firearms.Different pistols, muskets and so on.Because of this weapons parrying mechanic in Bloodborne is very good and even a new player can be taught how to use firearms and successfully parry ( otherwise player will be forced to learn parries because of Father Gascoigne ). Lore in this game focuses on Healing Church and its blood experiments affected on world, and as a result creating beings called Great One’s.Clearly the main villain in this story is Lawrence, Burgenwerth Student, and friend of Master **** brought old blood teachings to Healing Church, and because of that total chaos started.Lore is very interesting, and if you’re about to play the game - explore every location, read the description of items you find, and the atmosphere will hit you like tsunami and you will be living in this frightening world of Bloodborne. Most of the Bosses in main game are interestingly designed, and have huge lore connections to main events in Bloodborne lore and **** personal favorites are - German, Father Gascoigne, Martyr Logarius,Ebrietas fights with them are memorable and fair ( sometimes Ebrietas doing some crazy frustrating **** such as Lasers that aims directly on player ). DLC is carried by lore connections and boss quality,every boss in dlc is well designed and have connections with lore.Only Orphan of Kos was not enjoyed for **** there’s Ludwig,Maria,Laurence,Failures- these fights are memorable and designed **** these these bosses are **** example Lady Maria is my favorite fight from all FronSoft games, gorgeous design and fight, enormous chunk of lore stands before boss, and cutscene that bring me chills even now after beating the game times **** Laurence and Orphan are the hardest bosses from FromSoft games, and after I beaten Laurence ( Fistly I was playing DLC on NG+++ after beating the game to platinum, that was as pure hell fighting Laurence, every his hit was damaging 80% of my healthbar, I was trying with phantoms but it was no avail, and then I’ve diced to start a new character, and level up as much as I can, get the best gear and best armor and kill this **** yet first 5 attempts was big failure.I was at the brink of **** at my 8th attempt on new character, I’ve beat **** that pleasure,how I was screaming in happiness, it was incomparable to anything in my life ) after a week of struggle I’ve beat him, and I grateful to this game for this challenge, and overcoming it was really hard but rewarding. If we are talking about the minuses - there’s 2 largest types of minuses - Chalice Dungeons and consumable flasks.These minuses are we obvious and for some as large as they can hate this game for, but for me it was bearable. In the end of this large essay I must say that I spent about 160 hours in this game got my platinum, and beat this game times 7-8, and it was my first souls game back in 2019,and it is still my favorite one, only Sekiro is near to Bloodborne by experience, and because of how I love this game I give 10 to this game. 10/10",10,2022-05-13,PLAYSTATION 4,user

SuperClaudio64,"Bloodborne per me è stato il soulslike più facile da completare, e l'unica vera sfida del gioco si trova nel suo Dlc, che include sia alcuni dei boss migliori sia le armi più originali del gioco. Purtroppo il gioco base si ritrova con la maggior parte delle boss fight caotiche e confuse, specialmente quelle contro le bestie giganti di cui si riesce a vedere ben poco durante lo scontro ravvicinato, e quindi è difficile capire cosa stanno per fare durante lo scontro. Lo ritengo un buon gioco ma con dei boss molto deludenti e con attacchi molto simili, e con un ambientazione troppo ripetuta fatta di borghi e foreste e poca reale differenziazione della build del ****.

It's an ugly tunnel runner, combat system is nothing to write home about, especially when you get to fight some over-sized gob in cramped space where can't see crap what's happening because of the mentioned cramped space and the over-sized gob. That's the difficulty of this game, not the dying when fighting difficult enemies. Sure, you die some fighting hordes of mobs too a bit. One of the stupid things that there's no collision mechanics between them. You get to explore map that is boring and ugly. Mediocre crap for emo kids.

Mindkiller7522,"Just as a forward-I have completed Bloodborne in it's entirety and I'm very proud that I was able to do that. That includes all optional areas/bosses and every weapon and item found with every pathway explored. I did have to use an online guide to make sure I didn't miss anything. Now, this was my first FromSoftware game. It looked cool, so despite the difficulty I figured I'd give it a go. It is often described as ""tough but fair"" which is a stretch. Most enemies can kill you in a few hits and are often placed just off camera. Some bosses feel very unfair, but every one can eventually be beaten. Sometimes that just requires hours of grinding and researching the right weapons and builds that work. Not necessarily the best game design, but I can understand why people like the feeling of accomplishment it gives you. The main problems that I have are not as widely advertised. One-You can't pause the game, even when offline. People have lives and it's bad enough to have to be laser focused on a boss battle while your wife is trying to talk to you. Major points off for this unnecessary design decision. Second and most importantly-What starts as a promising and cool story that **** you right in really goes off the rails half way through. I was enthralled by Yarnham's districts and excited to see the Forbidden Woods that hid Byrgenworth College and Cainhurst Castle. Each avenue seemed to have a neat little sub section or shortcut. Then, the game devolves in to dream levels where it's just trying to be more and more gruesome and weird. Nothing feels connected and you just seem to teleport from one place to the next. By the end of the game it is almost required to watch a Youtube video explaining the story and it still makes little sense. It feels way to artsy and self indulgent. I did still put a ton of time into this game and enjoyed quite a bit of it, but i think it gets a lot of high scores that may not mention any flaws except the difficulty. Edit: I decided to change my review score after reading ""The Paleblood Hunt"" by Redgrave. That essay explains the lore of Bloodborne and should absolutely be required reading after finishing the game. So much of what seemed like nonsense in the game was actually a very intricate story.",9,2022-03-31,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Sekiro won game of the year unlike bloodborne who hasn't won game of the year but Bloodborne is also one of the best games of the century and also deserves game of the year that's facts Sekiro is just better than bloodborne i know some you that are hardcore die hard soulsborne fans like me would disagree and you don't want to hear or accept it but it's facts Sekiro is just better than bloodborne I have platinum bloodborne twice on my seperate account and on my main account as a veteran member of the soulsbourne community i love Bloodborne but Bloodborne is not better than Sekiro. Sekiro is the hardest Fromsoftware game thats facts people.. Sony Playstation what is you doing this game deserves a remake like Demon's souls Bluepoint games your on remake bloodborne and than make bloodborne 2 because its a crime this game is more than 6 years old Bloodborne has to be remaked for PS5 and we dont have a sequel for this game yet its a crime Sony PS you own the IP your going in gamer jail if you dont do a remake on Bloodborne because it has phenomenal boss fights one of the best melee combat in gothic hack slash action games the switching system of weapons is so good enemy variety is so good NPC story is so good the areas you go to are very interesting the art of this game is phenomenal a game you must play on PlayStation,10,2022-03-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user

RaphaelXL,"Seek a ray of light in this miserable world, not the luxury of pampering in a bright world. Fight in the dark, and finally get out of the cage to see the sun, but there is nowhere to escape. It is very difficult to restore a complete world view and restore a unified style of the world. Once completed, it is also shocking. Scary, eerie, sometimes magnificent, sometimes regrettable. Very artistic style. And this is all thanks to the cancellation of the minimap, which allows me to really observe the scene itself, rather than staring at the map. At the same time, it also puts forward higher requirements for scene design to make enough recognition. Let the players gradually become familiar with the scene itself, from the familiar fear of the unfamiliar to being as friendly as their own balcony. Ugly and disgusting feelings occupy the vast majority, but it is because of this that I have the surprise of finding any ray of light. People cannot be amazed all the time, and it is impossible. There is always an upper limit and a lower limit for the balance of human senses. As long as the fluctuation is large enough, shock can be formed. From being unable to defeat the miscellaneous soldiers at the beginning, to overcoming my inner fear and facing the powerful boss, my mind has grown tremendously. This set of logic is exactly what the real me lacks: face the fear, face the challenge, and there is a way out if you face it bravely! The design concepts of various boss battles are very unique. The close-up frontal risk is low and the return is high. The long-distance avoidance of the risk is high and the return is low. It is very easy to die if you open the distance. Active attack is encouraged, and extreme counterattack is also encouraged, and the attack is the defense. Tribute to the Orphan of Kos who killed me a hundred times. I've also gone from being a big fan of Souls games from the very beginning. The various weapons in the game are very simple to look at, but the actual combat is ever-changing and very deep. It is very rewarding to use every move skillfully to resolve and defeat all kinds of perverted enemies. The presence of the plot is very weak, almost imperceptible, there is no clear description, dynamic plot performance. Some only have item descriptions, NPCs talk to themselves, and hidden notes scattered in huge scenes are collectively referred to as clues. To understand the plot, you can only piece it together through clues. There is no standard answer, maybe the real answer is only in Miyazaki Hidetaka's heart, and every player can have his own understanding and his own answer. The game format of Bloodborne has had a profound impact on me, and my acceptance of the game has changed. Many previous game experiences seem to have been shuffled.",10,2022-03-20,PLAYSTATION 4,user
CnPx98,It's a good game and the asphetics looks amazing. The things which I really didn't like thou is the game is capped at 30 FPS and it stacks attacks making it feel different from other souls games. There is also no tutorial so if you haven't played other souls games you probably won't like Bloodborne. You also have no way to tell if your entering a boss arena and you can't leave boss arenas during combat. You mite be doing a scavenger run to level up then it's wasted cos you enter a boss arena and die then loose all your currency. How ever Bloodborne is a really fun and challenging game. The dark and gloomy level design is great. I love the enemies and the bosses. I really wish they would make a PS4 pro update with an FPS fix. I highly recommend players try out another souls game 1st like Dark souls 3 or Demon Souls. This will give players an understanding of the combat system.,8,2022-03-20,PLAYSTATION 4,user

StriderKiwi,"The best PS4 exclusive and arguably one the best Souls games (I slightly prefer Dark Souls 1 but both are masterpieces). Bloodborne is brutal and will challenge players from start to finish but damn is it rewarding. Whether you coop or not, this game is a harrowing and brutal adventure with of the most memorable and frightening bosses I've ever slain. The combat is faster than the other Souls games before it and while I was worried the addition of guns would ruin the combat, they actually don't and I could see some people liking their inclusion, but you can't rely on them per se. Think of this like an unforgiving hack and slash with a very gothic tone. This is worth buying a PS4 to play it and I can't imagine it's expensive anymore.",10,2022-03-13,PLAYSTATION 4,user

bebopi,"On par for my favorite Fromsoftware game, but it's not perfect. I can admit that some of the bosses aren't super fun, or are unfair if not approached carefully (Rom...). Not as many weapons as DS is also a valid point, but I think all the weapons manage to be fun unlike most of the filler weapons in DS. With the couple negatives out of the way, I can talk about why I love this game so much. Firstly it perfects the dodging combat system by making the player faster alongside the bosses. It's a constant tango of exchanging blows, dodging through hard hitting opponents, and ultimately coming out on top. The feeling of triumph over a boss is there even after multiple playthroughs. The setting also really appeals to me. The gothic Victorian areas feel very different from Dark Souls' castles, and as small as it is felt like it gave a huge new breath of life to the game. Its very gray, and I can understand that being a turnaway for people, but I think had the game had more vibrant color sections it wouldn't invoke the same dread and mystery as it does. Which speaking of... One of the huge inspirations for the game is HP Lovecraft. Not a shock to anyone whose even seen footage of the game, but it draws on the inspiration yet doesn't ripoff it. The pursuit of the eldritch truth and the deeper lore of the game always fascinate me even to this day. Overall one of my favorite games, and definitely worth a check for any PS4/5 owner who wants to get into Fromsoftware or a returning Veteran.",9,2022-03-06,PLAYSTATION 4,user

What I don’t like about the game is the story, it never managed to keep me engaged at any point, I always saw myself skipping cutscenes and dialogues, I’ve also never been a fan of the character you control not speaking at all, it’s so lifeless. There were also many repetitive bosses that required the same strategies, there were five that were very unique, fun and badass, I would go even as far as saying some of the best bosses I’ve ever fought, but at the end of the day the other 15 or so bosses were bland and repetitive… they added no rich lore or anything with meaning. I have to say, “I did love the atmosphere Bloodborne provided”.",7,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Snowadian,"The world of Bloodborne is so good. Loved the atmosphere and game aesthetics. I enjoyed the games difficulty right up to the bosses. I can't stress enough how much these bosses take away from the game for people who don't play all the time. I went about 20 hours into this game, frustratingly beat several bosses and then finally gave up at around the 20% mark . Difficult gameplay can be enjoyable, especially in a setting like Bloodborne, but unbeatable bosses make the game exhausting and tiresome (Nioh is another example). I'm not saying to remove the bosses at all - it would be nice for a 'boss skip button' for those of us who want to just play the levels or a story mode. Allowing some of us to choose to play on easy takes nothing away from those who love a challenge. Great game hampered by grueling bosses that take the enjoyment right out of it.",8,2022-03-03,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The way your character gets covered in blood the more you fight is such an amazing mechanic that I wish they and other developers will implement more. The game is definitely challenging at times but this was one of my first FromSoft experiences and I got the platinum trophy after some time. This game is one of my favorites of all time.

Balzari,"Visuals: 8 - Audio: 8 - Fun: 9 - Longevity: 9 - Engagement: 9 - Total Average Score: 9 If you are a fan of 'From Software's', 'Souls Games' ('Demon's Souls', the 'Dark Souls' Trilogy or 'Sekiro') you will love 'Bloodborne'. If you have played any of 'From Software's' 'Souls' games then you can expect more of the same: beautiful yet horrific visuals, haunting and rousing music, varied enemies and epic, fear inducing and punishing boss fights. Having only previously played 'Dark Souls' and 'Dark Souls 2' it did take me quite a few hours to get into 'Bloodborne' for though it is the same as those previously mentioned games, it is also different, with having a 'shoot / parry' move instead of a 'block' move being the biggest difference that took a lot of getting used. Unlike 'Demon's Souls', 'Dark Souls' and 'Sekiro's' visually varied levels, 'Bloodbourne's' Gothic themed areas whilst beautiful are all dark, depressing and foreboding.

brunamarianni,"Bloodborne was my first experience in the souls-like games, and after many deaths and a long learning process, it got absolutely addictive. The story, which is not clearly told, but hidden in the many items and quests, is beautiful and glorious. Full of secrets, paths, and new experiences at each New Game you start, there will always be one item that you didn't know was there, or a new path, or a new dungeon to explore. The possibilities are huge, and even though it seems frustrating loosing so many times for some bosses (or even to some stupid crows - don't let them deceive you, they can and WILL kill you if you give the chance), it is also highly rewarding when you finally beat them, and then it becomes a matter of honor to try it again and make it better! With different strategies to use with your character, amazing weapons for every type of game-play that suits your stile, Bloodborne is certainly a must play game, at least once in your life. If you manage this one, the other souls-like will come naturally! It is beautiful and nice just to walk around the different scenarios (after eliminating all the enemies, of course... ha ha), and not to mention the soundtracks! The Old Hunters expansion is also as great as the main game, certainly also a must have! I hope it will have a sequence one day!",10,2022-02-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Sadly, in my view, although bloodborne has its positives, it's not as good as those games, nor is it as enjoyable to play. My main issue with the game though is the lack of storyline and the randomness of the **** impossible to know what most of that stuff is without resorting to looking it up in forums on the **** me that's poor gameplay. The graphics are good though, and the atmosphere is excellent. I read that people found it difficult...I didn't think it was particularly, and once I'd got to around 25 vitality and strength, it was remarkably easy with the hunter axe I thought, especially some of the bosses (Rom, Paarl, Ebrietus, Mergo and Moon presence were especially simple). I did like father Gascoigne, Gehrman and Logarius on top of Cainhurst Castle though. Having finished the game and been presented with a NG+, after finishing all the way though to Vicar Amelia again, I gave up...i found it too tedious to go all the way through again. In fact I found much of the game pretty tedious from the outset...mostly due to lack of information to keep me engaged, as as noted earlier the distinct lack of story was a major shortfall I thought. Worth a look, especially now that its a cheap buy, but certainly not a classic for me, as many found it.",7,2022-02-18,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Kostas_Spirou,"Everyone told me to play this game. It was my very first FromSoftware game, and having no experience from their pasts games I expected to have a hard time with it. So, did it live up to the hype? Yeah! I really enjoyed it, infact, at times I expected it to be more difficult, but overall I think that it's fairly challenging, it knows when to punish you and it knows when to reward you. I loved the gameplay, it's extremely fun, with some creative mechanics, but sometimes the hitboxes are unpredictable. The first area is quite rough but once you manage to understand how some of the mechanics work, then it's just a joy to play. The worldbuilding is breathtaking, and the way the world changes when you have more insight is absolutely genius. There's a lot of content, exploring the different areas, uncovering secrets, finding shortcuts, interacting with the characters, completing side stories and taking your time with the game feels very rewarding. The atmosphere is unrivaled, it's scary & haunting but also beautiful in a very dark way. I absolutely adore the Gothic-Cosmic Horror theme and the Victorian-era inspired architecture, possibly my favorite setting in a videogame. The monsters look terrifying, some very interesting designs, and nice symbolisms, I personally killed every single boss - even the optional bosses - and I can say that there are some few tedious bosses but most of them are fun, and require strategy. The Blood Vial farming is very obnoxious in the beginning, but it's not a big issue once you progress halfway through the game. Having to manage your resources becomes more of a secondary distraction because if you play well, you'll not really need to use healing items, or Blood Echoes. Now, where the game disappointed me a tiny bit, is the storytelling, I don't mind games that don't explain the story very much, but this game has no build-up at all, and while I think the core story is great, it lacks impact, and if you want to learn why some things are happening, then you'll need to read assumptions & theories from fans which aren't confirmed to be canon, and you'll end up not having an actual answer. Fortunately the fantastic lore does make up for it, it's very intriguing & rich, full of mini stories. Overall I enjoyed this game, and I think it's an amazing game, especially if you're a fan of the Soulsborne genre, it's very close to perfection.",10,2022-02-18,PLAYSTATION 4,user

It takes all the bad mechanics from Dark Souls and makes them good, and it takes all great stuff from Dark Souls and makes them amazing, and it adds a bunch more exellent mechanics that feel so good to use and combine. The combat is polished anda ll the mechanics go together extremely well. I could stop playing video games for 5000 years and then pick up a controller and Id still have all the muscle memory to beaf the games ass. This game is daunting, and it has more horror than most horror games out there. Its a depressing world that you have to treverse, and the intemidating enemy and boss designs make you feel that much more manly when you get up after dying and try again. The game doesn't tell you jack **** so when you expriment, and learn something new its like adding a new tool to your arsenal, and unlike Dark Souls you wont be discouraged to try new things and tactics because of how amazing this game feels to control. All the bosses are amazing, terrifying, quick and reactive to your attacks like when you beak their bones or fracture their skull. This game is simply a must play, and I am very annoyed that most people cant experience it because you need a Playstation. Hope it gets ported.

Good: - Gameplay is very fast and fluent - Has fever weapons than other Souls but much better utilization of weapons, each weapon feels different (except hunters workshop weapons), and you can find one that suits your style. - Graphics hold up even in 2022 (Fromsoftware knows how to make a good atmosphere in the game). - Story is at first puzzly and It's not told in the usual manner which works in this genre you have to engage in the story read descriptions and make your interpretation of the story which is fun. Bad: - On ps4 the game has bad frame pacing, It's somewhat fixed on ps5 because of better hardware. - On ps5 the game is still locked on 1080p30fps. - Searching for friends in co-op takes sometimes too much time, would prefer just normal inviting in the world.",9,2022-02-08,PLAYSTATION 4,user

In 2022 it’s starting to show a little age in frame rate and graphics but the master-class art direction, perfect level design, and exceptional gameplay more than makeup for it. This is a game I’ll be coming back to for decades to come. In my opinion Bloodborne is the perfect entry point for someone new to FromSoftware style action RPGs - simple enough to be accessible for newcomers and deep enough to be a hit for veterans of the ARPG genre. Worth buying a PlayStation 4 if only just to play this game.",10,2022-02-05,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Sensou,"My biggest mistake might be I'm playing Sekiro before trying this game out which makes me not enjoying this game at all. I could see the potential of this game but somehow just not a pleasant gameplay for me where all you do is just dodging which also require precise timing. But, I'm a Sekiro player which dodge is out and parry of defense is a way to go. The world itself also is not looking appealing, again due to I played Sekiro before this one which makes me cannot appreciate the greatness of this game. Story not easily understandable so never truly paying attention to it where in Sekiro, you'll at least get the main plot of the story and understand it. Sorry Bloodborne, I just know FromSoftware from Sekiro which right now is my best game of all time so I'd like to try another FromSoftware game but turns out there's no other game like Sekiro. Will wait for Elden Ring.",5,2022-02-01,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Zizzi,"Super good and fun game, congrats to FS for trying a different take into the souls series with very different mechanics. The game is set in a perfectly made horror-like nightmare, progressing through the story will spook you from time to time but also staying still and looking around will give you the creeps sometimes, it is really well made and staged, incredible. Few things keep me from giving a 10 I fear: rare (but existing) junky hitboxes, certain enemies/bosses tend to stun lock you without possibility to defend yourself, and I would have preferred the optional dungeon stuff to be intended as mandatory to finish the game (not all of them, I’d say 3/4 dungeons) as the game itself is not really that long nor difficult to complete in a reasonable period of time. If you’re good at videogames in general and got some reflexes, you could complete this title in less than 70 deaths for sure, even if it’s your first souls-like game. I resume stating that this game is amazing and I invite everyone who’s interested in a challenge to play it. May the old hunters lead your way",9,2022-01-30,PLAYSTATION 4,user

UncertainX,"10/10. This is the best game I played on PS. I'm not a big fan of Souls game. I played Dark Sours 3 before but was never into it. I thought I would dislike Bloodborne but I was wrong. Though it looks like a Souls game, the gameplay is quite different. The combat is generally faster in Bloodborne. The gun + melee gameplay is much more enjoyable than the shield + weapon system in Dark Souls series in my opinion. Using your gun to parry an enemy is very satisfying. The lore is good as usual. I mean it's made by FromSoftware, certainly with a good story. Very good map design. The music is good. What else? I cannot think of many disadvantages. Probably there is one thing I dislike. The story itself is too simple. I'm not talking about the lore but the story. The story our players experience. For example, the NPCs you saved barely contribute to the story. A little disappointed.",10,2021-12-17,PLAYSTATION 4,user
YannySp101,"I got to say, as someone who didn't play any Souls games properly before, I was excited to play Bloodborne. Just like in the Dark Souls games, Bloodborne's lore is told via environmental storytelling. Environmental storytelling might not be as engaging as linear storytelling but it enriches the game's world significantly. Thankfully enough, Bloodborne's lore is compelling even if it's ambiguous for the most part. The gameplay surprised me a lot; it's faster than I expected, it feels very satisfying, the mechanics are wonderful, there's a nice amount of unique items and the trick weapons are so goddamn badass, they're one of the coolest things in the entire game for me. My favorite part of the game isn't the gameplay though, it's the haunting and frightening setting; Bloodborne's world is probably the best world I've seen in a videogame. It starts out as a gothic horror and it slowly transcends into a nightmarish cosmic horror that is able to find beauty in the dark. On top of that, the level design and the music are just perfect. The graphics are not necessarily impressive but they're really good nonetheless. Also, the bosses are intimidating, challenging and rewarding. However, many of the bosses in the main game are somewhat easy and underwhelming in my opinion, but fortunately, the DLC makes up for it; The Old Hunters is essential to own if you enjoy playing Bloodborne because it features the best bosses in the entire game. Now, while the gameplay is very enjoyable, the camera and the lock-on system are awkward at times, and farming for Blood Vials can be tedious at times. Pros: + Intriguing lore + Aggressive & diverse gameplay + Superb setting + Threatening & challenging bosses + Incredible level design and music + Amazing DLC Cons: - Flawed camera and lock-on system - Blood Vial system Gameplay: 9/10 Content: 9/10 Music: 10/10 Graphics/Audio: 8/10 Final Rating: 9.5/10 - Outstanding - Bloodborne is a fascinating videogame experience in almost every way, and I wish could play it for even longer. Do I recommend it?: Definitely, but keep in mind, the DLC is must-own in my opinion.",10,2021-12-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user

superpyro296,"Bloodborne is a game that surprised me and that I appreciated a lot. First, I was expecting a tedious and frustrating game because of its difficulty. The truth **** this game is very challenging but it never felt too tedious. The gameplay is really smooth, fun and engaging so I didn't mind restarting from the checkpoints and do again the same levels after I died. Bloodborne is around a 35 hours game if you go for the main story. There are a lot of optional areas and the game doesn't hold your hand, so there are good chances that they won't be discovered by the player. My only complaint is the fact that we lose the blood vials we used when we die. If you play like me, it can mean going to previous levels and grind items and blood echoes before retying the actual level. It felt a bit tedious sometimes, especially when I was stuck to a difficult boss. Graphic-wise, it is really top notch and they crafted a really interesting and unique world.

I had seen the game before, I had seen my partner play it, heck I had even beaten one or two bosses, but playing through it, from start to finish, was one of the best joys I've had with this industry, especially in a long time. I don't remember feeling this good about a game since TW3 Blood & Wine. Everything is on point, and even if the gameplay is a bit dated, it's still better than the other ones made by the same company. Japan Studio really pulled **** universe here, and it makes me wonder how much better From Software would be if they actually had a good narrative and art direction as Bloodborne did. It's a must play, the game works flawlessly, you can see it was tailored for the PS4, nothing is lacking, and there's also no excuse for those that say they're not good at games.

Bazza,"This game came out over 6 years ago, and I only started playing it last week. So far I've killed 4-5 bosses and am nowhere near finishing, but I can without a doubt say this is the most engaging, frustrating, brutal and soul destroying game I've ever played. You cannot just rush in and kill things unwittingly. It's a game where risk vs reward is off the charts, where you simply cannot afford to be complacent of cocky at any time, especially if there are hordes of enemies running at you, or during intense boss fights or you will be punished. When you die after a long run without reaching the insanely sparse 'save points', the game makes you want the earth to open up and swallow you. It's a painful experience but when you make it through, it's an overwhelming sense of catharsis and relief after a gut wrenching period. The atmosphere is also unbelievable, and it ties in beautifully with the unsettling gothic surroundings. You will jump out of your skin on several occasions when the game tricks you into thinking you're safe, but you seldom are. This game is free with PS Plus. I was in the middle of playing finishing my Mass Effect 3 playthrough when this interrupted it and the controller has been fused to my hand since.

Citizen_Kanye,"Before I begin this review, I must disclose that I am completely biased. Bloodborne is my favorite game of all time, bar none, and even if it has a few minor flaws, everything else is so ingeniously designed that I will still rate it higher than games with less objective flaws, such as DOOM 2016, Half-Life 2, Celeste or Dragon Quest XI S. Bloodborne is Hidetaka Miyazaki's Magnum Opus. Dark Souls may be his most famous title, but his best, even according to him, is Bloodborne. The game is a masterpiece of gameplay, level design, worldbuilding and story (as long as you bother to actually decipher it). It begins with a classic gothic horror setting, placing you right in the middle of a Victorian-era city gone to hell, and expects you to fight, die and kill to hopefully make it out of there, all while getting vague hints as to what exactly is going on. You're given minimal instruction, a couple weapons and told to go out and kill things. Bloodborne is not easy. It is possibly the most difficult of the Souls series, but also the least unfair overall. Bloodborne pushes you to play more aggressively, rather than suggesting a more defensive style that was popular in Dark Souls, with both a faster dodge, faster weapons, a complete lack of a shield and a rally mechanic that allows you to restore your health for a short time by hitting enemies after you took damage. However, this does nor mean you get to be blindly aggressive or a button masher, because every action you take is a commitment; it cannot be canceled. In most hack and slash games, you can cancel into a roll from mid-swing and perform the roll without punishment. That is not so in Bloodborne, or any of the Souls games. If you swing, you must complete that swing before you can dodge. So long as you understand that and are careful with your attacks, you will perform far better in this game. The level design is phenomenal. There are very few checkpoints, but every area has at least one shortcut that wraps back around to one checkpoint or another in a way that feels incredibly intelligent. It feels like an epiphany every time one is discovered. Some of these lead back to areas you were in hours ago, and nearly everything is interconnected in some fashion. Enemy placement is brutal, but well-designed, so as to teach you where enemies like to be and to keep you on your toes. Every inch of this game is a learning moment, and there's always something new around the corner. The bosses in this game are absolutely ridiculous. Nearly all of them feel like a monumental challenge, but in a way that feels conquerable once you learn their move set and patterns. Nearly all of them will punish defensive play, such as backpedaling, with large, lunging attacks, so you have to use the invincibility frames of your dodge to properly time slipping through their attacks to punish them. There are about three bosses that don't feel all that great to fight (Witches of Hemwick is hide and seek, Rom is a minion-based boss with hard-hitting magic to watch out for, and Micolash is a massive game of chase, followed by an uninteresting fight until the second half, where he has a move that can kill you in one hit), but the other fourteen bosses, not including DLC, are all phenomenal, and have their own ways of being beaten most efficiently. The story is often heavily talked about by people much more knowledgeable than I, so I will not discuss it too far, but I will say this: not only is Bloodborne a beautiful reimagining of the works of Stoker and Lovecraft, its tales are written better than both of the original authors, while also perfectly inversing the classic Hero's Journey tale. It is truly a treat, and is one of the best horror games ever made from a story standpoint. The DLC is the best twenty dollars you will ever spend. I will say nothing more; if you buy this game, get the DLC. It is everything good about Bloodborne distilled and concentrated. It is also significantly harder than the main game. There are a few flaws in the game, being the run mechanic not allowing you to cancel into a dodge, instead making you jump (and with the counter hit mechanic, where you get punished for dodging incorrectly, a jump counts as a dodge without the invincibility frames and you will take double damage), the frame drops at some of the more graphically intense moments (this does not happen on PlayStation 5), and Micolash and Laurence's boss fights (Laurence is an entirely optional DLC fight, so he can be avoided), but these are overall minor flaws and most can be avoided. The Chalice Dungeons could also be considered flawed, but I still like them, because it is more Bloodborne content, and they're also entirely optional. Bloodborne may not be a perfect game, but it has very few flaws, and its many strengths are so powerful that I could never rate it anything less than a ten. This is my favorite game ever made, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.",10,2021-10-13,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Napsta,"I've always been a fan of souls-like games, but I think that Bloodborne is different from the rest of the souls series. Sure, it's made by the same company who made the Souls series, but It's got a special charm to it. One of my favorite things about this game is the atmosphere. There are so many areas and enemies and even items that give you this unnerving feeling. The soundtrack for this game is also incredible and ranges from epic battle music to creepy music for a cultish town. The obvious draw about these games though is the gameplay and Bloodborne does not disappoint in that department. It's much more fast-paced and rewards more aggressive playstyles and fast reaction time. Another thing that's important to mention is that instead of having what are essentially a few different kinds of weapons with different levels of power, Bloodborne has a variety of weapons that can make your approach to fights significantly different, from a simple saw or axe to a giant chainsaw pizza cutter or a curved sword that can transform into a bow. It's also cool that they have some of my favorite bosses of all time.

It is difficult like some resident evil games where you struggle with controls and game owns you just because its controlling is bad and you cant do nothing about it. I mean inconsistent hit-boxes, teleporting of enemies towards you, surfaces clipping etc. And if compare it to sekiro which worth struggle because game is beautiful and completion stages of it opens something new and beautiful. But here in bloodborne there are nothing interesting to open except new areas with terrible design. But sekiro is good so i guess bloodborne was required step to acheive what they achieved now",0,2021-09-16,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Пусть игра и легче своих сестёр - тёмных душ (кроме DLC, в котором обитает самый сложный босс всех соулсборнов), атмосфера и зрелищность в бладборне на уровень выше.

Сюжет, на самом деле, присутствует и, хоть он скрыт, он намного интереснее сюжета почти любой из игр. Огромное количество противников. Оригинальные боссы, у каждого есть своё слабое место. Единственный минус - Чаши и их Подземелья. В общем, люди, поигравшие в бладборн, делятся на два типа: 1) Прошли игру и ставят ей 9-10 баллов. 2) Дошли максимум до Чудовища-Кровоглота, сдались, и пошли лить сопли в виде низких оценок, именно из-за таких, кстати, у игры столь незаслуженно низкий юзерскор.",10,2021-09-11,PLAYSTATION 4,user

3diculous,"Bloodborne is fantastic but not without its flaws. BB was the first game I played on PS4 and may be the last I Replay as I retire the near the end of its life console. My first Fromsoft game was Dark souls and from sequels to successors I know that I will never have an that first experience again. Comparing BB to DS is almost Impossible not to do and after that first experience subsequent games with similar Games will always feel easier. After one souls game I Was clued into how I should approach enemies and bosses. overall I think DS will Hold the place in my Heart Over BB. Not because BB is worse in any way. Just that my first experience with this type of game can't be recreated. However Bloodborne is not a game I played for its difficulty. I could not care less whether it is harder or easier than dark souls. I feel this argument is like comparing a soccer ball to a basket ball than saying you can't enjoy one sport over the other because of how the ball bounces. What I enjoy In BB and what makes me want to replay it time and again is the dark Victorian era world/stylisation, enemy variety/designs, exploration of the unique weapons and items (whether the RPG elements have been dumbed down from DS or not, I don't really care). This is a good example of one of the best visual experiences I have witnessed in a video game. One of the biggest problems for me is the healing system. while having a timeframe to get health back after being hit suits this games faster pace and aggressive combat. I have never liked the blood vials. The 'chug and run' nature of its use detracts a lot from the combat as almost all enemies are primed to chase and pressure players limiting options and approaches to the gameplay. Limited options in combat make it feel more repetitive and the combat feels cheaper overall to me. Enemy variety alleviates this to some degree but the problem is ever present in the game. A great game I will play again.",9,2021-08-26,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Bloodborn esta no meu top 3 melhores jogos, mas nem por isso o considero perfeito. Ele só esta tão alto no meu top porque entrei de cabeça em procurar explicações e fui atrás de foruns e videos para entender melhor a história. A sua história básica é muito simples e mal explicada, sendo praticamente plano de fundo para o jogo. Sei que a forma padrão de contar história deles desde Demons Souls, porem não deixa de ser ruim já que apenas aqueles muito empenhados vão conseguir ter um bom entendimento sobre a história.

If you've played FromSoftware games before, this iteration puts a little hiccup in the normal dodge-then-attack rhythm of combat you're probably accustomed to. Instead of encouraging a patient and watchful approach to fighting, Bloodborne rewards skillful aggression with its parry and rally mechanics. Both the enemy layouts and the world are deviously designed to murder you dead and the boss battles are epic with music that makes them like biblical events. Enemy designs range from terrifying to horrific as you battle all manner of hideous beasts, ruthless monsters, and mysterious Gods. Like all FromSoftware games, the rich and expansive lore is mostly told through item descriptions and dialogue rather than cutscenes. This game treats you like an adult with no hand-holding as you explore its bloody depths with your trusty weapon in hand and uncover all the dirty secrets hidden within.

jeremy_F,"best souls game in my opinion, it has the setting the lore, the gameplay and combat. the game is different that dark souls in a good way. the combat is similar but it improves the game mechanincs and combat of the dark souls series is a way that it is more enjoyable. in dark souls and demon souls, you can hide behind a shield most of the time and that is not fun. In bloodborne, you can get the health you lost from getting hit by attacking the enemy that did damaged to you, it encourages more involved and active play. i could go on and on about the game but I'm not going to. you have to play it all the way trough to fully understand the beauty of this game. and if you don't want to play it, i strongly recommend watching lore and story videos for the game, it could get you to play the game or it could be an enjoyable time to listen and watch videos about the corrupt and brutal world of bloodborne.",10,2021-08-10,PLAYSTATION 4,user

cableguy3333,"As a fan of darksouls I got a ps5 for demonsouls and bloodborne, wow what a disappointment with both. Bloodborne is not in the same league as darksouls, sure the graphics are nice but as a challenge there isn't one, basically it's the same fight over and over again untill you get to Kos then its a change of tactics and its finished. This has been dumbed down for casuals hence the high score, stats hmm such a vast array to choose from ( sarcasm ) , clothing items sure if you like black, you start with the saw weapon and there is no reason to change it, you also get a gun just chuck that in the bin it's useless and equip a torch it's more useful. Most of the enemies all look the same and that includes the bosses. As far as I know this is the only from soft game with noises a child would make, Kos please stop screaming but he's not the most anoying, the most anoying is the 2nd to last boss who shouts Bam every 10 seconds, just shut the **** up and one last one some dude just runs about a building talking about Kos, that boss was just plain anoying. Anyone who says this game is hard has clearly been using a summons while playing darksouls. Blind playthrough i died once by the time I had killed the 3rd boss, most bosses are either a first or 2nd attempt. If you want and easier challenge than dark souls then sure go for it but if you're looking for something of similar or harder then stear well clear.

Then I heard that the dungeons glyph were difficult and I tried it. Again the same bosses, but the ""difficult"" like the entire game is based only in the amount of life or the damage, and like I said before: turn to the enemies' back, hit, run. But much more times.

EatmeApart881,"Bloodborne was my first fromsoftware experience but in my opinion, it is one of the most atmospheric games ever made. You will immerse yourself in Bloodborne's gothic and bloody world, the different artstyles that Miyazaki use aren't new but how he mergrs them together shows his great understanding of video game level design and that's probably Bloodborne's greatest strength. But the next thing that Bloodborne gets right is pacing and gameplay. There aren't too many NPCs in the game and the ones you follow doesn't have happy endings either, making Bloodborne's world more cryptic and dark. The boss fights all benefit from such high qualities that ranking them is really hard, each one of them demands a specific skiil from you or sometimes a set of skills to get pass. Environment story-telling in Bloodborne is at its peak because Bloodborne doesn't tell you everything right at the start, you are left to truly understand and **** this world yourself.

The visuals are great and the game is engaging enough but there is no reason for these insanely high reviews. The weapons are all copies of each other and they all function quite similarly. The gun is vastly useless and not needed to defeat any enemy. The game is punishing! Not in the sense that it is too difficult because it is not but in the sense that there is a steep learning curve if youre used to playing other hack and slash games. Once you get the hang of it, the game is repetitive and boring and lacks direction. I am level 26 or so and have gone pretty far in the game and I still have no idea of the purpose.

I have smoked my whole life, I drink too much, I'm slightly over weight, I do plenty to mess with my body but if some fool swung their arms at me that slow they would be getting knocked the **** out. But that's me, never mind some bad ass monsters. I played this game twice for about 5 minutes and hated it both times. There are literally 10s of 1000s of games with tighter controls. If the main character is someone that I could knock out in 2 seconds, then the game is piss poor from the get go. Games in the 90's were way better on the controls. I can't be arsed doing gay finger gymnastics for no reason. The buttons in the first 5 minutes just felt a bit unnecessary as I find with many PS4 games, as if adding more buttons means better gameplay. So yeah it is gonna be full of gore and blood and guts and monsters, or creatures getting mashed up, I'm not 12, it doesn't excite me, I don't find any shock factor in that. So what is there to enjoy? Not a lot. I can't say I know anyone that goes on holiday to look at grey and brown derelict buildings. I am here with a game though that is shoving grey and brown at me. You know the colours of mud and the sky when it's going to rain. Ugly **** Yes I know this is the theme of the game but it doesn't make it any less drab. The gothic buildings have a nice design, plus 1 point but the game did nothing but turn me off from the start, so it loses that point again. I don't know what I expected here but I didn't expect it to feel like my character was being controlled over a dial up internet connection. It was like slow motion.

saxdude1,"This is possibly my favorite PS4 game and favorite game of all time. The combat takes the Dark Souls format and adds a bit of hack and slash speed for flavor (while also ditching shields) for a strong action RPG. The boss design is only second best to Dark Souls 3 and the DLC expands on that even more. The level and art design also helps it to stand out, taking initially a Transylvanian aesthetic before merging it into pure Lovecraftian eldritch terror. The lore and story, while taking a back seat to the gameplay (as it should), is very unique and makes one of the most unique and well executed takes on a Lovecraft-style story. I will say this game is sadly held back by the hardware of the PS4, even the pro has some unfortunate framerate dips. That said, if you have a PS4, you are doing yourself a disservice to not even attempt the game (the difficulty is still a turnoff to some).

I like difficult games, but Bloodborne, like the ""Souls"" games, is difficult just to be difficult and make up for lack of substance. If you don't have a job or relationship, Bloodborne is for you, since progress saving is basically nonexsistent, and progress doesn't really occur. You can't just pick it up for a couple hours, because there's no point-you don't get anywhere, and if you do, it's not you can save where you're at and pick up where you left off. 4 hours into the game, and you're still just aimlessly wandering about, with no real direction or purpose. You are severely underpowered, and I don't think in these 4 hours any character spoke. There is absolutely NO story to speak of whatsoever. There's no sense of any kind of progression. in the first 20 minutes you run into a boss who's CLEARLY meant to be fought against late-game (some giant bird on a bridge). The devs decided ""let's throw a bunch of cool stuff together haphazardly and then forgot to add a story.

darkdrkst,"9.3/10 Honestamente, creo que Bloodborne es de las mejor exclusiva de PS4. Obvio es desde lo subjetivo, yo creo que los juegos de From no son para todos los jugadores y realmente no me parece que todos puedan disfrutar de este título como lo he hecho yo, pero si eres un jugador que busca una obra que se sienta realmente auténtica a pesar de ser un ""desafío"", recomendadísimo. Honestamente no hace mucho que he jugado este juego, lo empecé a inicios de 2020 y a pesar de haber jugado muchos títulos, en el dicho año he completado la campaña de Bloodborne hasta 5 veces. Realmente estamos ante uno de los mejores juegos en cuanto a atmósfera se refiere, Yharnam es de los mejores mundos que he experimentado en un juego de vídeo, el diseño de la mayoría de zonas es espeluznantemente hermoso, más si lo sumas con unos gráficos oscuros tan ambientalistas y un diseño de niveles que, si bien no alcanza la perfección del primer Dark Souls, llega a destacar para bien. La jugabilidad es de las más exquisitas y satisfactorias en los ARPG, es un Souls y puede llegar a ser monótono el hecho de spammear el R1 y el círculo, más aquí donde las formas de jugar están mucho más limitadas, pero como todos estos juegos, desde esquivar un ataque de instakill o hacer un parry llega a ser de los pequeños placeres de la vida, y más en este título que si bien, es mas o menos parecido a sus precuelas espirituales, es mucho más intenso y frenético. Los jefes son de los mejores, para mí los mejores de toda la saga, combates realmente intensos con una dificultad alta, que además se vuelven más fuertes y más terroríficos conforme pasa el combate. La historia y el lore son excelentes en todo sentido, quiero hacer una review sin spoilers (a 6 años del lanzamiento del título) pero los giros de trama son para morderse los dientes, a pesar de estar ""narrado"" como está el juego, el trasfondo y la historia de Yharnam es espeluznante y desgarradora, y de las más interesantes y originales de juego alguno, la manera de tratar los temas presentados en este juego es de los mejores y más detallados que se han hecho, hasta afectando en la jugabilidad en este aspecto. Los NPCS no son tan memorables como en otros juegos de la compañía, pero hay bastantes que tienen mucho que ofrecer. Definitivamente es un juego que tiene realmente gotas de excelencia demasiado altas, pero como todo en la vida, no es perfecto, y tiene algunos defectos que me agradaría comentar. El DLC hace que el juego base se sienta incompleto, es más, pasa realmente en todos los juegos de la saga Souls, es más bruscamente pronunciado en DS2 pero aún así, al menos también me pasa en BB. Y es que From pone tanto empeño en los DLCs que terminan teniendo los mejores jefes, zonas e incluso bandas sonoras, y dejan a los juegos base como una experiencia que se siente icompleta, ya que a pesar de que tienen alta calidad de por si, lo mejor suele perderse. Las mazmorras del cáliz son el peor contenido del juego, no motivan al jugador a seguir adelante y realmente aburren, no hay tantas recompensas interesantes más que algunas para farmear materiales, y realmente la mayoría de jefes son de baja calidad o directamente reciclados, es obvio que solo los que busquen el platino irán a pasárselas mas nadie. Y por último, Bloodborne, a pesar de que tiene su propia personalidad, se siente como un Dark Souls más rápido. Al menos yo, siento a este juego como un spinoff de los souls, ya que la mayoría de animaciones, varias mecánicas e incluso items, no son similares, si no que idénticos a Dark Souls. Esto puede ser bueno o malo, dependiendo a quién, pero a pesar de que Bloodbrone recompensa más el ataque y la agresividad que castigar a tus enemigos, y hace el gameplay menos táctico y más Hack and Slash, se puede jugar muy similar a un Dark Souls. Realmente, si buscas una experiencia totalmente diferente a lo acostumbrado, ve por Sekiro, que si la ofrece, pero me parece que Bloodborne, es más como un toque refrescante y mejor pulido a los juegos anteriores. Aún con sus defectos, Bloodborne me parece una de las mejores obras que se lanzaron en la generación pasada, es realmente de mis juegos favoritos y lo recomiendo a todos los que tengan una PS4 y estén dispuestos a cualquier reto, es artísticamente hablando la mejor obra creada por FromSoftware y Hidetaka Miyazaki, uno de los mejores y merecidamente apreciados desarrolladores de videjouegos. Todos los SoulsBorne, incluyendo Sekiro, son dignos de ser jugados debido a la autenticidad que ofrecen y la filosofía tan honesta que conllevan, a mi me cambiaron totalmente la percepción del videojuego, y con todo esto, considero a Bloodborne como el mayor pico de calidad que han alcanzado.",9,2021-05-28,PLAYSTATION 4,user

GogglesofCritic,Well i was never a big fan of the souls formula but Bloodborne did me well. The story is basically non-existent if you don't dig deep into the lore but the gameplay is so delicious and fast-paced. Bloodborne is intense action and terror through a gothic and dark world and if you like those things bloodborne will serve you well.,9,2021-05-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user
MetaRogue,"Bloodborne is a fantastic example of how to do a spiritual successor of a series of hardcore games for hardcore gamers. Instead of simply rehashing the formula for the Demon/Dark Souls series, Bloodborne takes the basic core components and aesthetic, and repurposes them for a brand new 'Dark' Victorian setting and entirely new gameplay elements to 'Get Good' at. Much like the Souls series, Bloodborne basks in the rich moonlight of it's darkly cryptic (and somewhat obscure) narrative and labyrinthian design of its horrific world. Where Bloodborne truly distinguishes itself is it's combat - while the basic fundaments mimic Dark Souls superfluous combat design, Bloodborne demands a more aggressive approach to most encounters. In Bloodborne you will find no shields (well, actually you'll find just one), meaning that the only defence is a good offence. Instead of timidly entering a room or stepping into the fray with shield raised, you must rely on your speed and wits to win battles. Replacing the absent shield is your trusty firearm, a weapon that is intended to stun enemies instead of significantly damaging them. Furthermore, Bloodborne rewards risky and aggressive tactics - when taking damage from an enemy attack you have a limited window of opportunity to retaliate and regain your lost health with retaliatory strikes. While I can't say that I've finished Bloodborne, I can say that it is a masterpiece - a dark and disturbing masterpiece that will live on in the minds, hearts, and 'Souls' of hardcore fans. To the completers of this game, I salute you. To the uninitiated, I bid to you to try, but also be warned for this is not your usual mainstream game. As always - Praise the Sun.",9,2021-05-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user

WhateverDude,"To you, unknown stranger of the internet who will probably puke at the casual I am. Review are personal, you do not have to agree. I played ds1, ds3 with DLC, i'm no great player that's for sure but I'm not completely incompetent. I spent 20 hours on BB and stopped at orphan of kos. Never again. Bloodborne was to me the most painful and worthless experience in all the games I played in console ever. Not only I lost my time, I felt **** by a degrading, humiliating, violent and plain mean game designed to puke at human beings and make them feel bad. I'm okay with challenging game, but this is too much, this and maps layout designed to kill the player on the slightest and most unfair mistake. That's why I'm giving it a 1. The game is great, but designers were **** on purpose and I feel I did not deserved such treatments. I intended to do every soul games, I'm guessing my journey ends here. I'll keep at heart the dark soul licence which I love. Update on 23/04/2021: I beat the orphan after 4h30 of grinding and then I blazed through the game. I beated every boss of the DLC I'm only missing 3 in total, all of that so that I may have the right of my own opinion. My score will remain the same : Bloodborne is from the beginning to the end, a sadistic, gruelsome and unfair game which does not give you any sense of fulfilment. The graphics, story, atmosphere, whatever you want are all butchered by the frustration I had playing. I did not enjoyed this game. Bloodborne is strictly overrated.

ariangoodarzi,"bloodborne is a very great game however i think this game is overhyped. lets start with the story. it's a very unpopular opinion but i think bloodborne has the best lore of the souls like games however the way it's told isn't as good as the souls series and is very **** the gameplay : bloodborne's combat is really creative and fun with switching to different forms of weapons is fun but my complain is that there isn't any real defensive options there's just a dodge so it's really hard to get used to and playing it slow like the souls series won't work and the healing system is really bad in my **** let's talk about map design : the map design in this game is pretty linear however some areas are connected which is really good. the lanterns are pretty well placed but the map design sadly isn't even close to dark souls **** lets talk about the boss fights and music : the bosses in this game are mostly really damn good and fun to fight but some of them are bullsh.t, they have broken hit boxes and get stuck lol. the music in this game is fantastic sadly not as good as dark souls 3 and 1. now the classes : the amount of classes in this game are sadly not as good or much as the souls series so it isn't as replayable as the souls series. now the pvp : the pvp in this game is ehh its alright i dont really have anything to say about it. the npc's in this game are just too good i love all of them they just feel different from the souls series and that's what makes them special.overall i give it a 8.5 out of 10. it has been reported that it's coming to pc and ps5 with a remaster in a few months so hopefully the pc players and xbox,switch players that have a pc can play it.",8,2021-04-20,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Major_Ripoff,"Bloodborne is the type of game that you'll either hate or love or love to hate and hate to love. When I first started to play this game I hated it. I hated it for making me start levels all over again after dying multiple times. I hated it for its random difficulty spikes and arrogant stun locks from both enemies and bosses. I've never played the Dark Souls games so I went into Bloodborne blind. But after the first few days I couldn't stop playing it as it drew me in. I had to see if I could follow it through to the end. So I did just that and finished the game and obtained all 3 endings. Afterwards I thought to myself what a hell of a journey. Great locations and atmosphere with a few exceptions. Music is spot on and graphics are still decent even by today's standards. Gameplay is fairly tight, but also with a few exceptions. If you play the game you'll see what I mean about a few exceptions. Anyways, Bloodborne would rank in my top 10 of all time favorite games even though I hated it at first. It grows on you and once you ""click"" with the game mechanics and how to fight it becomes very addictive. However it doesn't rank a perfect score of 10 because no game has ever reached a 10 by my standards because that means there's no room for improvement. Bloodborne is a 9 for me regardless because there are a few issues with the game. One of which is the hitbox on enemies and bosses. It gets wonky sometimes and doesn't register. Another issue is frame drops, especially when your fighting many enemies or huge bosses. These two issues may be linked together however.  I think the most useless game mechanic is the frenzy status. This alone almost made me quit the game permanently. It's a cheap system mechanic that serves no other purpose than to aggravate the player at the most inconvenient of times. If your health bar isn't full it becomes an instant kill. Speaking of instant kills, this game is full of them. Some bosses and even some enemies will kill you in one shot. Not my idea of fun, but whatever. I think Bloodborne is at least worth a try to first time gamers looking for a challenge. I know that the Dark Souls community appreciates Bloodborne for what it is. As for me I'm glad that I stuck with the game even if I did find it frustrating at first.  All in all it's a game worth trying out. You never know, you may find it as addictive as I did.

TeamAlex,"Bloodborne is a pleasant alternative to Dark Souls. At least that's what I thought at first. After years I finally got this game to get an impression for myself. And my aversion was almost palpable. Bloodborne is comparable to Dark Souls 1 and 2 in terms of the speed of gameplay and the variety of fighting methods. The only thing worth mentioning are the ""trick weapons"" that bring in individuality. Otherwise, Bloodborne, like the Souls series, has a very bad level design, let alone world building. The maps puked us after the first NG, luckily you can rush them in a few minutes. Positive points. - Different weapons - Several possibilities to create your character build - Enormously large space for healing potions - Warehouse - Helpful community in terms of dungeons and messages. Negatives. - Most of the bosses - Bad FPS on some bosses (especially Loran the Darkbeast) - You often have to farm HP potions in NG 0 until they become meaningless at some point. - Map design is bad and monotonous There is also our personal boss ranking, which was created after several NG ++ processes depending on the strength of the opponent. - - 30. Witch of Hemwick - Just a joke of a bad boss 0.5 / 10 29. Celestial Emissary - The same, what the hell is this? No ideas left? 1/10 28.Micolash, host of the Nightmare - Deserved place as the most hated boss. 1.5 / 10 27. Mergo's Wet Nurse - As soon as you stand behind her, the fight is practically over. 1.5 / 10 26. Moon Presence - Secret Boss? Who can do less than some normal monsters? 2 / 10th 25. Blood Starved Beast - Can't even hit. Best boss for a no-hit challenge 2 / 10th 24. Living failures - That's how I feel about their gameplay too. 2 / 10th 23. Cleric Beast - Tutorial Boss, nothing more. 3/10 22. Darkbeast Paarl - Blunt gun finishes it in seconds 3/10 21. Amygdala - At first I didn't notice that this was supposed to be a boss. 3/10 20. Father Gascoigne - Second stage has something to offer, otherwise low PvP boss 3.5 / 10 19. Pthumerian Descendant - Weak PvP boss in the dungeon # - 3.5 / 10 18. Yharnam, Pthumerian Queen - Exceptionally pleasant boss, but weak. 4/10 17. Vicar Amelia - Way too much HP in the early game and terribly bad design and gameplay. Generally too easy. 4/10 16. Rome, the Vacuous Spider - Most creative Spider Boss in Souls Games so far. 5/10 15. Shadow of Yharnam - definition of a bad boss - 5/10 14. Undead Giant - Bad boss 5/10 13. Gehrman, The First Hunter - At first he looked impressive. If you look at it correctly, he is an unsuccessful PvP boss who can do nothing. 5/10 12. One reborn - Who makes such bosses? Seriously? Which trainee was that. 5/10 11. Ebrietas, Daughter of the Cosmos - Run around and hit your butt like always. 5.5 / 10 10. Headed Bloodletting Beast Nothing worth mentioning typical 0815 boss - 5.5 / 10 9. Martyr Logarius - Visually appealing. Not from difficulty. 5.5 / 10 8. Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower - An excellent boss and, as it should be, they only learned something new in the DLC. - 6.5 / 10 7. Watchdog of the Old Lords - If you have no idea, you just take 50% HP off, so that the fight becomes harder. - 7/10 6. Loran Darkbeast - Who can hit this thing? Blunt gun is still the solution. 7/10 5. Ludwig, the Holy Blade - Very visually appealing. Gameplay only good in the second stage. 7/10 4. Laurence, the First Vicar - Pure garbage and copy & paste boss with fire - 7.5 / 10 3. Amygdala (chalice) - A monster as big as the whole room with endless range and only 50% maximum HP allowed. Another fall of no creativity. 8/10 2. Orphan of Kos - Best boss in gameplay, very well done. - 8/10 1. Abhorrent Beast - One of the strongest bosses and personal nemesis by speed and DMG. 8/10",6,2021-04-07,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Kowxley,"Played this game right after Dark Souls 3, and I never thought it would be as good. Well, it's even better. The gothic and lovecraftian atmosphere in this game is the best love letter ever to this style in any form of art I've seen. From the monsters and bosses, to the dark, haunting streets of Yharnam, to the incredible architecture, it's wonderfully made. The combat is so much fun, sometimes very hard yes, but nothing beats the feeling of killing a boss after dying to it 30 times. Best ps4 exclusive I've ever played, hands down.",10,2021-03-03,PLAYSTATION 4,user

XDemonX,"This is one of the, if not the best game, i´ve ever played. It has one of the best combat systems of all time with every weapon being totally unique and fun in their own way. There were (at least in my play-through) no cheap deaths, i always knew what I did wrong and that it was my fault that I died. However I due think that the choice to make this game hard was a bit bad because allthough it never was something that bothered me personally I can see how it makes people quit the game and I do think that the first boss should be a little bit less hard because it pains me that so many people will never fully experience this game because they heard it was hard and won´t buy it because of that or dropped it because it was, quote: bull**** . It isn´t though, it´s beautiful, the levels are awesomely designed and even the worst level still has many things I like and there are pretty much no bad Bosses as well. (Other than DS3, which I like too, but not as much). And before you say that I´m a biased From Software Fan boy, I´m not, I played this game because I loved the opening cut scene and because one of my friends told me to check it out. I don´t recommend this game to people who love a challenge, I recommend this game to anyone who wants to play a masterpiece.",10,2021-02-26,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Combat is fast-paced and will test your reflexes. I really love the outfits for your character although they seem to be really limited in helping you out as armour. Barely any noticeable protection which actually opens the door to just wearing whatever you think looks cool since the fire armour is barely going to help you much more against a fire using enemy (as an example), I do have a couple of nit picks such as you cannot reassign your RPG points, having to go to the Hunter's Dream to teleport anywhere instead of directly at the lamps like in DS III, and some of the Caryll Rune buffs are pathetic (2 or 3%, really?). But it is easy to overlook these shortcomings because the combat is fantastic and the bosses are so much fun. Runs like complete **** on PS4 as you will see frame drops especially on the boss fights but it mostly runs fine. Game is on the top of my list for should be ported to a PC ASAP.

Jvnps,"Bloodborne is to me the best Fromsoftware game to be released to date, with fast paced combat, a interesting story, and an incredible environment make this a 10/10 for me. There are some frame rate issues, but it really only affects you when you go into a loading screen. Some people hate the dungeon system, but me personally I enjoy the dungeons and use them to farm for blood echoes and blood gems, but I can see why people hate it as it is a grind to go through them all, and if you want to platinum you have to do them all. I already mentioned that the combat is fast paced which differs from dark souls where a majority of the combat is shield, strike, shield, strike. In bloodborne the combat uses a lot of dodging, getting hits in, retreating, and doing it again, although your best bet is to counter and use viseral attacks to deal major damage. Like most Fromsoftware games you have to discover and piece together the story yourself which can invest you into the game. The environment is absolutely gorgeous with beautiful victorian style buildings, roads, and rooms. The DLC only makes the game better with new enemies, weapons, clothes, and bosses which add even more to the story. To sum it all up if you have a Ps4 Bloodborne is a must play, and if witcher wasn't released in the same year I do believe that it would have won game of the year.",10,2021-01-25,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Just as hard and rewarding as the legendary Dark Souls, while managing to be more fun and without a single second of the game being worse than the rest. It has as smooth combat that never takes control from you, a dark immersive world full of creative enemies and bosses to cut down and incredible lore story and characters, there is nothing more anyone could ask from an action game and this is why Bloodborne is a must-play masterpiece.",10,2021-01-25,PLAYSTATION 4,user
NitroxX,"La verdad es que ha sido toda una experiencia pasarme Bloodborne. Conociendo poco la saga Souls y únicamente habiendo jugado 2 entregas de Hidetaka Miyazaki. He de decir que Bloodborne me ha gustado bastante. Teniendo una historia en mi opinión más apetecible que las entregas de la saga Dark Souls, Bloodborne brilla más por utilizar unas mecánicas ya conocidas es los juegos de FromSoftware que están mejor definidas y mejor implementadas. Además de la caracterización de escenarios, personajes y enemigos que dan una ambientación y contexto mejor en mi opinión. Además me parece que aunque beba mucho de los Souls ha sabido ubicarse en el tiempo y hacer algo diferente que refresque un poco el género. Básicamente resumiendo Bloodborne me parece un gran juego que ha sabido reinventar un poco la saga Souls y dar un soplo de aire nuevo al género. Creo que esta un poco por encima de cualquier Dark Souls aunque sí que en mi opinión está por debajo de Sekiro que me parece el mejor juego de FromSoftware.

Wweald,"Great world, plot, lore, combat, bosses. Basically everything about this game is fantastic. The main flaws are the lack of build diversity in the early game, and the even more linear world design. Magic and gunplay are not viable ways to build unless you're in NG+ because you basically get one or two weak items for those builds until the game is nearly over. There is a lot more fast traveling in this game and for some reason they made it the absolute worst, the loading screens are really long and stupidly you need to go back to the main hub instead of being like DS3s system. Some of the bosses and enemies are kind of lame but there are only a few. Defenitely the most interesting world to me, but not as many interesting characters or side quests for them.

Это было невероятное приключение с ворохом незабываемых впечатлений. Я никогда не играл игры from software раньше, но очевидно теперь я опробую и другие их игры. Минусы не значительны, но во-первых мне не понравилось ковыряться по гробницам - не смотря на их большое количество, они друг от друга практически ничем не отличаются. Они не обязательны, но если вы хотите добраться до важного для истории босса, то вам придётся их гриндить. Во-вторых, я несколько раз застревал в текстурах, от чего мне приходилось обнулять прогресс до чек поинта, что не может вызывать раздражение.

Not_A_Shill,"Hello, I'm absolutly not a paid corporate shill and this is my unbiased Review for BLOODBORNE BLOODBORNE is a masterpiece of video game narrative. Nothing else even comes close. The story is brutal, challenging, bold, and almost never ""fun"". It is harrowing, forcing the player to confront violence in a way video games never do. In a medium where everything is John Wick, BLOODBORNE is Schindler's List. And just like that film, there were times when I wasn't sure I could keep going. It is a relentless emotional assault that I suspect will force even the most jaded gamer to feel empathy. The game is a work of art - every aspect feels crafted at the highest level. Visuals, audio, controls, animation, level design, performance. It is astounding. And frequently beautiful. With moments you NEVER find in video games. But I cannot overstate how harrowing it is. It feels like 2 seasons of the darkest TV show you'll ever find, and it frequently better than most TV on the air. That's saying a lot. I think it is an IMPORTANT game. It tore me up, and I will never, ever forget BLOODBORNE is a game that will change you. In short, BLOODBORNE put me through hell. I did not enjoy it. I wasn't supposed to. I was affected by it. Like no game before. I am in awe of it. I am recovering from it.",10,2020-12-31,PLAYSTATION 4,user

dewdar,"This is not my type of game. Most of the core gameplay and mechanics is something I'm not so interested in and try to avoid. So you can count me as a newbie in this type of genre. Game is not easy on beginners and feels anything but fair to the player. In a game where precision is one of the key elements of success the game can have noticeble time of fps drops, even on PS4 Pro. The fact that the game is full of bugs can be both a curse and advantage. Not to mention, beginning of the game can be one of the most tedious intros that was way harder then I could stomach. Just because of a friend's recommendations I forced myself through the first boss. And from then on I just couldnt put down the controller. So what changed? I'm still not a fan of the gameplay, that's for sure. Short answer: what keeps me engaded is the locations, art direction and deep lore: The intro gives a glimps of the world that lies ahead. Although the locations of the first level are beautiful, they still don't do justice for what is to come. Locations are big and full of details and hidden corners, that you want to explore and study. The game rewards those who has curiosity and attentiveness. Many times you will return to previous locations to discover something you left unnoticed or maybe because of some changes based on you later actions. Whatever it is, the game gives you many reasons to return to other levels to enjoy those landscapes and gorgeous architectures once more. Those level bosses. They are some many, some of the can be ok, but majority of them are original, unique, detailed. Not once you will come across a boss that blatantly was copied or redone and presented as a new one. Not to mention their design, unique features and strategic attack you have to adapt to. I can't think of another game that could achieve so much diversity, both locations and bosses. If locations are one of the most motivating elements that keeps me returning to the game, I'd have to say it's the lore that keeps me sealed in. The game doesn't waterboard you with story exposition that other games suffer from(I'm looking at you Kojima), in fact it's possible to finish the game without finding out what's really going on. There is very few cut scene, usually an intro for the next boss, just a few of them give any story related information. Most of the info surrounding the pandemic you get through messages that lies around the city, interraction with NPC(which are rear) and through location details. I don't see this game as a perfection as some make it out to be. The game have quite a few technical issues, such as I mentioned. AI can be braindead from time to time and the ragdoll physics can ruin the haunting atmopshere built by the lore and visuals. Despite noting the drawbacks and problems, the game delivers an amazing rich experiece. I would especially suggest to try it out if you're a fan of horror and know works of HP Lovecraft. The game is filled with lovecraftian elements and wears it with pride on it's sleeves.",9,2020-12-15,PLAYSTATION 4,user

AlexDarwin,"Графика хорошая, музыка на высоте, отличный дизайн уровней и монстров. НО: сюжет нужно выдирать из каких-то записок, описаний и т.п. Т.е. въехать что вообще происходит - проблематично. Звук иногда ужасный, например, когда персонаж ходит в воде - на рипите стоит один и тот же короткий звук и никак не меняется. И подобных примеров хватает. Это бесит и отдаёт халтурой. Ну и конечно сложность. Есть казуал, есть сложность для среднего игрока, есть сложность для тех, кто хочет прилагать услилия, думать как победить, а есть серия Souls. Этой игре плевать на вас. И всё бы ничего, если бы сложность была 150%, но при этом все геймплейные составляющие должны быть отполированы на те же 150%. Это честно. Но нет, в Bloodborne сложность нереальная, секундное замешательство и ты - труп. Беги всю локацию сначала, опять бей всех монстров. Иногда из-за того, что камера коряво встанет, персонаж промахнётся, хотя вроде бы всё указывает на попадание. Может налететь группа монстров и зажать в углу и ничего ты не сделаешь. И игра не работает по принципу: мы всё сделали сложно, отполировали, тебе нужно только подумать - нет, здесь сделано по принципу: поставим здесь кучу мобов, сделаем неудобную для камеры локацию и нам похер, сможешь ты или нет, мы ведь fromsoftware, и нам плевать на баланс и удобство. Может игра бы и зашла, буть побольше чекпоинтов, но в таком виде в каком есть - это тупо издевательство. И было бы круто, если бы за такие челенджи давались бы какие-то ачивки в виде роликов, порции сюжета, хоть чего-то, но здесь ты можешь убить монстра через 4 часа мучений и получить в награду....ничего. Разработчикам настолько плевать все составляющие, кроме сложности, что они даже NPC рот не анимируют во время разговора. Кому игра подойдёт: 1) тем, кому важен только геймплей 2) тем, кому плевать на сюжет, персонажей, диалоги, катсцены 3) тем, у кого железные нервы и склонность к садомазохизму 4) тем, у кого очень много времени и его некуда деть Кому не подойдёт: 1) тем, кто любит интересные сюжеты с персонажами, диалогами, катсценами 2) тем, у кого мало времени на игры 3) тем, кто любит сложные игры, но не любит маразматическую сложность, доведённую до абсурда",0,2020-12-06,PLAYSTATION 4,user
megamix64,"Я не был любителем жанра souls-like. И игра далась мне не сразу. Я возвращался к ней трижды в течении двух лет и все же одолел до конца. Чувство от прохождения Bloodborne трудно описать словами. Я казалось, что я могу всё! Поначалу меня пугала подобная сложность, но с каждым разом я возвращался к игре ради атмосферы, сюжета, лора. Сеттинг напоминает The Order 1886. Но недостатки «ордена» все же перевесили ее достоинства и она не стала тем чем для меня стал Bloodborne. Игра от From Software - настоящий шедевр и достойнейший эксклюзив PlayStation.",10,2020-12-04,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Oreshulya,"Изумительный солс лайк, один из лучших в этом жанре. Многие ради этой игры консоль даже покупают, что уж тут говорить. Из плюсов, разумеется, стандартное для многих солсов: 1)Атмосфера. Вся эта кровавая тематика вперемешку с готической архитектурой, постоянными стонами, криками, и запутанным непонятным лором - это очень круто, тут особо и говорить нечего. 2)Боевая система. В бладборне мне она нравится больше, чем в серии солс. Здесь большинство оружий уникальные, обладают какими-то своими особенными механиками, в дсе в этом плане поскуднее. Поэтому бладборн с огромным удовольствием проходишь заново, так как новое прохождение - новое оружие - новые эмоции. 3)Боссы. Боссы- это, в принципе, одна из главных вещей, которые присущи таким играм, и в Бладборне они изумительные. Особенно если брать дополнение, чего стоит один Людвиг... 4)Музыка. Музыка тоже на 11 из 10, это у фромов всегда на высшем уровне. Тем не менее, я поставил 9 из 10, потому что у игры есть ряд минусов: 1)Графика. Очень слабая графика для игры 2015 года и одного из главных эксклюзивов консоли. В тот же год вышел ведьмак 3, понятно, что это очень разные игры, бюджеты несопоставимы, но в бладборне порой просто больно смотреть на мыло. Камни и локация перед Тенями Ярнам - это отдельный ужас... 2)Подземелья. Абсолютно унылая дрочильня, которая обязательна для получения платины.. не знаю, зачем фромы это придумали, лучше бы добавили новую локацию какую-нибудь. Ну, в итоге, 9 из 10 - маст хэв, одна из лучших игр плойки, все дела",9,2020-12-02,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The gameplay is challenging but addicting. There are few cons to this game but one is the graphics on a plain PS4. One particular area/room absolutely CHUGS so if you're picky about FPS that's something you should know before buying. Another con is how stingy it is with regards to story.

Pros: -excellent graphics Cons: -you fight the camera all game, camera makes boss battles much harder than they should be -story is lacking and so cryptic, you need to look for external sources to start to understand -there is no real tutorial or learning area, as such, you can go most of the game without realizing simple basic mechanics until you serendipitously discover them -the system of opening short cuts during progressing on a level rather than multiple camp fires/checkpoints is inferior, it increases the amount of needless backtracking -the trick weapon system as a means of defence is inferior to block/guarding Overall, stick to the Souls games, this game feels like an experimental off shoot that falls flat",1,2020-11-17,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Siralfon,"bloodborne es un gran juego , aunque su nota sería como un 8,7 el gameplay es frenético , la ambientación está muy lograda , pero para mí está solo por encima de dark souls 2 si lo comparamos con el resto de juegos de miyazaki , inova en demasiado poco , y la cantidad de builds es limitada (armadura ligera y poco daño pero muy rapido , solo se puede cambiar el daño ) la mecánica de las pistolas está bien pero se vuelve exceptuando unos pocos casos , un aparato para hacer parry puesto que su daño es nulo . La ambientación es muy buena y el diseño de los enemigos también pero donde yo creo que bloodborne cae es en el pobre sistema de atajos ( cerca del jefe hay un ascensor o una puerta que te lleva cerca de principio de la zona ) y una conexión de mapeado nula . El otro punto negativo de bloodborne son los jefes , algunos están muy bien pero la mayoría son repetitivos e injustos : Las brujas , El renacido , rom o los emisarios celestiales son algunos ejemplos . Pero al final es un gran juego que todo el mundo debería jugar",9,2020-11-16,PLAYSTATION 4,user

I found it hard to get to grips with it as it's not intuitive if you don't know the context I.e. it's not an easy, guided game, I didn't understand what was the story about or what I had to do and where to go, all the contrary, I'd say it's the hardest game I've ever beaten. When I started playing it I think the first chapter is what took my longer because of it. But that's exactly what makes it so addictive: you wanna beat it, and you want to understand what's going on. You'll be killed a zillion times but you need to keep going and eventually you'll beat that invincible boss that brings you down time and time again. It might even take a few days to beat that boss. You might even feel disheartened because it is so hard and may leave the game for some days.. but when you get to finally beat him, oh boy... and you will think... If this boss was so hard and I'm at the beginning , what the... is coming up next??? Spooky... Game is very dark and hopeless, all cloudy, cold, wet , bloody red and dark as the darkest night...

No es especialmente profundo el set de movimientos, pero sí lo es la progresión de armas mediante piedras de sangre. El diseño del mundo lo veo sensacional. Un laberinto cargado de secretos donde se premia la curiosidad e iniciativa. Lamentablemente, no soy el mayor fan de la críptica narrativa de este juego. Sé que hay algún vídeo por ahí, haciendo arqueología para desentrañar ese supuesto puzzle llamado historia. Tampoco soy el mayor lector de Lovecraft, a decir verdad, prefiero otra literatura antes. No me apasiona, pero lo respeto, por eso ciertos momentos fuera del desafío, me saben a poco.

Legend3994,"I really enjoyed the base game, and my advice to anyone looking to play that isn't looking to sink hundreds of hours into this - play the DLC as part of the first playthrough. Otherwise you are forced to either restart the game for a balanced difficulty or alternatively grind for ages getting the best gemstones in high level chalice rituals or just be extremely good at memorizing timing to cheese boring V attacks (shoot + counter). The game is dripping with atmosphere. It has pretty balanced difficulty. You'll die instantly if you don't pay attention. It highly rewards paying attention to loot, items, enemy attacks, shortcuts to get back to safety. It's great. There was 1 boss that I couldn't handle no matter what I did but I managed to weasel into the forbidden woods and level up 25 levels in a few hours and savagely slay the beast. If you like Dark Souls 1, 3, and Demon Souls, you'll like this. The DLC would be as good as the base game except for the sudden spike in difficulty for Orphan of Kos. He requires such precise timing with parry and dodging leaving virtually no room for error. He can kill you in seconds and it's infuriating. There's also no NPC summon. It takes leveling to 160 with a maxed out weapon, plenty of fire paper and beast pellets, appropriate runes (up visceral attack, lake/great lakes) and tonssss of practice.

I don't consider myself a ""souls pro"" - not even close, I never got past Ornstein & Smough - but I managed to beat every single boss of BLOODBORNE, including the optional ones. BLOODBORNE is hard but it definitely is doable. The best part of BLOODBORNE is the atmosphere and the world design: it borrows from Gothic horror and H.P. Lovecraftian Cosmic horror, but not in a cheap way, oh no, it does it in the best way possible and has enough originality to not be just a knock-off. I will forever remember my first climatic encounter with Father Gascoigne as the best fight ever in a game. It looks and sounds great and has a terrific soundtrack and unique voice acting.

ivanivanovski,"This is my favourite game, period. I bought this game at full price and initially hated it, I thought once again that I simply wasn't into these souls-type games, after playing Demon's Souls years prior as a kid and, while loving the gameplay, was not keen to stick with it. This time it was different. Maybe it was because I paid full price (and I was gonna get my money's-worth). Maybe it was the theme and atmosphere that captured me the moment I booted up the game. Regardless I find this to be one of the most entrancing 'gaming experiences' I've ever had. Every part of Bloodborne is brimming with character and uniqueness. The world is beautiful and engaging, in a depressing kind of way. I was never into the whole Victorian-London theme, but something about this game made it work for me. The gameplay is aggressive and engaging, there's an adrenaline to fighting almost any enemy when you can't cower behind a shield. The stun-lock mechanic is satisfying and visceral, which summarises the entire combat system perfectly. The world feels lived-in, the atmosphere is surreal. This game is a testament to why atmosphere and immersion is such an important factor to so many games. I felt like the Hunter, I felt the risk, I felt the reward, and I sure felt the frustration at times. The bosses are chefs kiss. They're all solid, even if a few are a little on the easier side, particularly one, early on (a couple of hags, you know the ones). The narrative is confusing, but the more I paid attention, the more glimpses I got at the bigger picture. And of course watching a few videos explaining wtf was going on also helped, but I think it pays off well to not have all the answers presented to you so clearly, in a game like this, it works wonders, and only add further to the atmosphere throughout. There's also a fair-share of tragedy in the characters you meet/interact with. If you get the 'true-ending' and understand the situation (probably a second run), it's beautiful, epic and a little sad, all at the same time. Basically I could praise this game infinitely for the sheer amount of joy (and madness) it brought me. This is one of those games that I have no regrets about, the good, the bad, the in-between. It was all worth it, worth the experience, and the platinum. You should play this game. Also, even a game that is given a 10/10 is not perfect in my mind, and this is no exception, but as an entire package, it's art. Regardless. PLAY IT.",10,2020-08-29,PLAYSTATION 4,user
ilx4ever,"Its a really good game, just Dark Souls 3 should be higher ranked. I dont know why people enjoy it so much, when Bloodborne is lacking behind Dark Souls 3 in combat mechanics, in lack of pvp content, in lack of better coop, in lack of invaders, in lack of player hints and mostly in lack of memorable level detail. Yeah it is a little harder than DS3, but its mostly because the combat system is not as flawless as it is in DS3.",8,2020-08-26,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Stolow,"Bloodborne is a game that I simply cannot put into words. It's beautiful yet horrifying, gorgeous yet ugly and tough but fair. Fromsoftware are infamous for creating unforgiving works of art with rich story, phenomenal boss battles and expansive worlds. Yet, there is always that one area or boss that really grinds the game to a halt. Either the setting or enemy is way to hard for all the wrong reasons and may possibly affect the entire experience for some. Yet with Bloodborne, I felt none of this. There are weaker levels and bosses in the game but none that never made me rethink the 10/10 score I would give it. I do not wish to give too much away since this game is absolutely amazing when going into it completely blind but if this is your first Souls-like game, then expect to be treated like a toy. However, dying never feels like your fault. It's either that you didn't see an attack coming or you dodged at the wrong time. Every attack from every enemy is telegraphed and it comes down to the player to react to that. It favours a much more aggressive play style that compliments this perfectly as it gives people who have played Dark Souls before something new as well as a new player into the series getting used to combat. With all said and done, Bloodborne is an experience like no other. A vile and disgusting world with dark and horrific story as well as heart pounding gameplay mix together perfectly into something that no gamer should ever miss. I know that this sounds extreme, but it is worth buying a PS4 just to play this. I hope all of you get to roam around Yharnham some time.",10,2020-08-20,PLAYSTATION 4,user

With that being said, I struggled with Bloodborne and had to put it away twice because of my frustration of not being able to survive the game and there is no option to change the difficulty of the game. However, for some reason I kept wanting to play this game even though I **** at it. After two failed attempts in the last two years, I decided to give it another try a couple of months ago. I watched several YouTube videos and read online on how to beat this game. To my surprise, although it was difficult for me to beat this game, this became the first game for which I completed 100% Trophies. I loved the engaging and rewarding combat, great selection of weapons, good user interface and absolutely stunning Yarnham City. I also enjoyed doing Chalice dungeons as it helped with powerful gems. I also enjoyed all the boss fights (except Ron spider) and mob fights. I enjoyed this game so much that I ended up playing it again.

zp3nz3r,"Bloodborne is a game that reinvigorates the meaning of immersion and challenges expectations. Even if borrowing heavily from souls games, it possesses a unique and awe inspiring identity that supersedes any of it's counter parts. The artistic direction is probably the most fascinating thing about this game. The dark Victorian aesthetic makes you makes you feel like you're in a Lovecraftian or a Bram Stoker novel. Dreading every corner, yet being mesmerized at the beautiful scenary and architecture. The sound design makes the hairs on your arm stand up, as you wonder through cursed forrests and haunted towns and castles. Shrieks in the distance and music boxes playing past certain buildings. Enemies in this game are some of the most facinating and gruesome things to encounter in your adventures. All of them unique in their design. But after defeating them, you'll truly feel like a hunter worth your salt. Gameplay is more fulfilling and facinating than previous souls games. Although, more simplified. Bloodborne offers a sufficiently varied arsenal with even more diversity throught their unique weapon transformations. A bad ass weapon conversion mechanic straight out of a steampunk novel, allowing for an array of tactics for every encounter. Want a sword-like walking cane, that transforms into a bad ass whip? Or a straight-sword that holsters into a freakin tomb-stone, turning it into a great-hammer? For the first time, in an effort to accommodate to the victorian theme. Blooborne introduces firearms to the series. Each one designed for specific affliction. Want a cool blunderbuss with scatter and stopping power? or a longer range and more damage, like the hunter's pistol? There's virtually no blocking in Bloodborne. Instead, you'll have to adapt to a more aggressive playstyle with pistol parries and the new rally system. A mechanic that offers you a chance to recover lost health at the risk of dying. All of this encourages for a more fast-pace style of gameplay, that keeps you on your toes. In classic FromSoft fashion, the story is as cryptic as ever. The game has you exploring for environmental storytelling, talking to npcs and reading up on a plethora of unique items for back story into the tragic and unnerving world of Yharnam. Although almost perfect, the game isn't without it's flaws. Unlike previous souls iterations. Bloodborne has a different take on the resting ""bondfire"" points. This time adding lamps that don't allow for rest and only allow for travel to the safe haven of hunter's dream and not in between lamps. Making it a waste of time having to travel twice to get to your destination. Again, unlike previous souls games. Usable items ""blood vials"" and QS bullets are only replenished through farming, as oppossed to having them restock every time you rest at a bonfire. This can be an annoyance specially when most of the looted items are these two specific items. One more thing that Bloodborne introduces, is the Chalice dungeons. Pesky procedurally generated dungeons that are integral to the lore and to an extent, the progression of your character. To put it short it's a procedurally generated grind-fest. Where enemies and bosses posses an obscene amount of health and the rewards only get decent on the latter and even more difficult dungeons. Players committed to their character builds will be spending as much time here as they will in the main game. These flaws pale in overwhelming contrast to the masterpiece that is bloodborne. A grotesque, yet captivating world where being a hunter of beasts never felts so immmersive and engaging. Every tactic must be considered, and every blood vial and bullet accounted for in the fiendish realm of Yharnam.",10,2020-07-25,PLAYSTATION 4,user
qulprit,"This game is nothing short of amazing. The lovecraftian setting is a sight to behold. The combat vastly differs from the Souls series, but also stays true to the series. The weapon mechanics were a breath of fresh air. The introduction of trick weapons allows for more critical thinking when choosing which weapon loadouts to choose. The score is also something that captivated me, from Gascoine's adrenaline rushing theme to Vicar Amelia's nerve racking piece. This game is by no means easy, as it is developed by From Software.

Quarantine has made me check out this game with all the time I’ve got on hand and it really shocked me how good this game was. I have really been missing out with this one! I was told that the dark souls games were very difficult but I didn’t believe them until I played this game. Boy was I seeing the game over screen a lot! That didn’t take away from the fact I was having fun! I got the DLC as well and I finished the game and put the controller down after I was about level 300. I was able to put myself in the blood borne universe and it felt amazing! The gameplay here is so unbelievably addicting and fun. I haven’t played any action RPGs like this one and I’m glad I was able to put so much time into it. All the weapons in this game are fun. I really liked the leveling mechanics in the game and the fact you get acquainted with whatever weapons you want rather than getting a level 1 sword and throwing that away after you get to level 2. It makes you get more intimate and familiar with whatever you choose to use and I appreciate that. Fromsoft was able to put together a solid and unique gameplay experience that really has the player fully engaged in the boss fights because let’s face it, that’s where all the fun is. I would recommend this game if you’re looking for a good challenge and can handle throwing your controller out of frustration at times ****...kind of. Amazing game!!!",9,2020-07-21,PLAYSTATION 4,user

virtualvince,"Right. Game completed, Old Hunter DLC done, all trophies got. It's time to talk about this game, even if 5 years late. Some context, this is my first FromSoftware game, and it for sure won't be the last. I had heard the warnings, how this is a difficult game, and I was all in. I would say that, yes, it was difficult. For me it was, because it was my first FromSoftware game. I'd imagine in 2015 it posed less of a problem for those who played Dark Souls 1,2, and Demon's Souls, but by the end, I 'got' the gist. For the uninitiated, starting up this game for the first time with no guide, and no reference, I was completely confused. The literal first thing you have to do is basically die to a well over-powered thing. Ok. This is different... In fact, the first couple enemies I actually fought were with my bare hands, because the game doesn't 'tell' you how to equip anything, let alone weapons. This game you sort of have to work the most basic to the most advanced things out all on your own, and to be honest, I enjoyed that. What's so great about this game? This is the first game possibly in ever that made my heart beat. At a major boss encounter you're almost there, you've got your 000's of 'blood echos', the boss is within an inch of its life, and ... you messed up. Then it's back to the drawing board, and you get your 'blood echos' back, you die again and rinse and repeat, until, eventually you try something different that works. I found the game really rewarding, albeit frustrating at the beginning. Game 'is' damn hard, for the uninitiated. But gets easier as you level yourself. Even with this, there were only a couple of bosses I cleared first try. Every boss, especially those found in the chalices, are unique with their own considerable array of move sets, weaknesses and strengths. The combat is pretty deep due to all the different builds you can make with armour sets found in the world. And the choice of weapons is extensive, just enough, not too crazy, but very varied between them, and each weapon allows a degree of combo's. The world is so crafted and well-designed, it all just fits, and makes sense. You feel a sense of relief every time you unlock a shortcut, which means you won't 'have' to repeat longer paths and even the collectibles found in the world are genuinely useful. Everything serves its purpose, even if you won't necessarily make use of every game mechanic in a first play-through. It's all in there to be discovered, and played with. You'll want all the blood vials you can find, especially early on. The gems you find are excellent, another layer in aid of weapon combat, and there's even pvp, which I admittedly did virtually none of, except for getting attacked a couple times. I did the whole game including the bosses and chalices solo, but it's cool that online is there for those who want the co-op. Finally, writing notes was another interesting game mechanic, which I'm sure must be part of FromSoftware games like Souls, but getting health from ""fine"" appraisals came in handy during a few boss fights. I'm going to rate this highly, because it's very deserving, although not perfect. The chalice dungeons, although a great idea (and there are a lot of them - replay-ability!), I found these became a slog. They are optional, but I feel had the trophy requirement not demanded chalice exploration of me I'd have skipped altogether. I also had a few questionable camera moments usually in conjunction with the enemy lock-on feature, and it cost me a couple of deaths to bosses, for sure. And I found playing this on the now 7-year old PS4 hardware gave questionable sub-30 fps at times. It almost stuttered to a lock during one particular boss encounter. So, a little surprising this wasn't optimised a little better given its PS4 exclusive tag, and how other more cpu and video intensive games in recent times cope better. I'm looking forward to trying the Dark Souls games and feel I have a better grounding in what to expect. Not perfect, a strong 9/10.",9,2020-07-18,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Ya por su ambientación gótica llama la atención y más si añadimos la violencia y el gore. Como en todo Souls, la historia la vas descubriendo conforme avanzas hablando con los personajes que te encuentras y leyendo las descripciones de los objetos. El juego es exigente y requiere habilidad ya que aquí no hay escudo para cubrirse, es esquivar todo el rato. A nivel de escenarios y nivel gráfico es increíble con unas estructuras góticas muy recargadas. El nivel artístico es increíble. En cuanto a los bosses, algunos imponen bastante y otros resultan bastante desafiantes hasta que les coges el **** te gustan los Souls, debes jugar a este.

MarcinhX,"I want to say right away, I'm a fan of the souls series, and I love games from From software. I went through the whole series of Dark souls games, including Demon souls.I passed: Midira, Smoky Knight, etc., so that they would not think that bloodborne was too complicated for me and I didn’t understand anything. On the contrary, the game is insanely easy if in dark souls, when killing a difficult boss, there is a lot of excitement, it’s a great joy that you finally defeated a strong opponent. In bloodborne, I almost fell asleep in a fight with them. I do not mean DLC! In this game, I found the pros, but they are very few. I really like the overall style and architecture of the game. The second plus: I like the idea that the weapon can be modified in a completely different way. They say that in BloodBorne * cool bosses * either I don’t understand something or they did not play Dark souls 3. You may ask: why compare BloodBorne and Dark souls 3? Yes, because Dark souls 3 is a direct competitor to BloodBorne. Many bosses have just the same model, but just different skin colors. For example: Church Monster, Amelia, Monster Paarl, Lawrence, etc. I am silent about the bowls that are made so that the player has spent a little more time in the game. I, as a lover of parrying in this game, am disappointed because in this game parry when passes when not. There are very few weapons and clothes in the game compared to Dark souls 3. I am silent about the extraction of consumables, the place is the same, already proven mechanics, as in Darks souls 3. They decided to EXPERIMENT. I heard that Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is also an EXPERIMENT. Why, when a company creates, not another Dark souls, is it an EXPERIMENT? In general, I liked the idea, but the implementation, no. This game didn’t have enough cool bosses like in Dark souls 3. If you could choose clothes in dark souls for about 10 minutes, then you don’t have to choose bloodborne, since it’s almost useless armor, since it’s resisted, and it’s broken. even first-aid kits in the game are possible, almost 30 pieces, twice as many as in Dark souls 3. But in Darks souls we could pump both the number of first-aid kits and their effectiveness. If you do not compare this game with Dark souls 3, then it’s not so and bad. And if you have not played, not one, not the other, I advise you to start with BloodBorne. Good game to everyone.",2,2020-07-11,PLAYSTATION 4,user

mattlarkin,"Take the FromSoft’s Souls formula for gameplay. Make it faster. Throw in a gothic setting complete with werewolves. Add some Lovecraftian horror. What do you get? Bloodborne. You get Bloodborne. I can probably stop the review right now. Because if that combination doesn’t sound appealing, we can’t be friends anymore. Okay? Okay. Like any Souls-Like game, Bloodborne takes a brutally challenging (but almost always fair) action RPG mold that rewards learning the game’s patterns and player skill as much as grinding, while at the same time allowing multiple levels of character progression. In typical FromSoft style, the story is largely hidden. If you don’t read the item descriptions, and go digging, you’ll probably have only the basic idea of what’s going on. Short version—the Healing Church used the forbidden Old Blood to enhance life/cure diseases for the population of Yharnam (said gothic city). This has the unintended consequences of creating a blood plague that periodically transforms people into werewolves (called beasts). This prompts a hunt. The player character comes to Yharnam seeking a cure for some disease and gets roped into becoming a hunter of the beasts. Which also involves getting stuck in a recurring dream he or she visits periodically and if slain. If you’ve played Dark Souls, the feel is similar, but, like I said, faster. The focus shifts from defensive play to offensive play, largely aided by the ability to recover lost health but hitting back if you do it fast enough (and don’t get hit again). The speed almost made it feel a bit more like Nioh than Dark Souls. And like all of the above, yeah, it’s hard. It’s supposed to be, to make the reward all the sweeter when you finally achieve victory. Souls-likes have become my favorite kind of game in recent years, and I highly recommend you check this one out.",10,2020-07-07,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The combat and mechanics are a refreshing change from other FromSoftware titles, being notably faster-paced with a focus on aggression rather than cowering behind shields a la Dark Souls. The game also boasts some of the best bosses--both in gameplay and design--of any Soulsborne entry. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the art direction, design, and story of Bloodborne is incredible and unique. The world is very grim and cosmic horror plays a very important role, and FromSoftware did it all perfectly. If you like FromSoftware games, Lovecraft, or if you like any video game at all, definitely give Bloodborne a try.",10,2020-07-03,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The gothic atmosphere is simply gorgeous and immersive, yet disgusting in a good way (best part of the game), the combat is hard yet fair and dynamic, the bosses are absolutely incredible and unique (although I prefer Dark Souls bosses a bit more), the soundtrack is very well done and the take on H.P Lovecraft's type horror is probably the best ever made (along with The Thing and Alien IMO). And no, you don't need to have played Dark Souls to play Bloodborne, they are different games (and I like Bloodborne the best overall). The ONLY reason I don't give this game a 10/10, and it's VERY close, is because of the Chalice Dungeons, which as a matter of fact are optional, yet flawed and could've been less tedious. With that being said, this game is a very close masterpiece and you should definitely buy it (along with The Old Hunters DLC which is just as good).",9,2020-07-02,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The storytelling is minimalistic and you could easily finish the game not knowing much about the lore, for that, I recommend VaatiVidya's youtube channel which will enable you to dive deep into the fantastic world that FromSoftware has created.

The basegame is already fantastic, but the DLC is even better in any aspect, especially the bosses, which are mostly more challenging than any of the basegame bosses. The chalice dungeons are the biggest weakspot in this game, because of the monotonous level design and gameplay, but are offering a big chunk of new content, so it is worth it. This game itself is a 9/10, very close to 10/10. Including the DLC it would be a 10/10 for sure.",9,2020-06-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Virtuoso_IV,"Bloodborne is one of, if not the best game I have ever played. I love everything about it, the visual designs, the graphics, gameplay is super fun and bosses are well designed and fun to fight. Not to mention Bloodborne had one of the best sound design I have ever experienced in a game. It made the game scary without being a horror game. Heck, I'd say it's scarier than most horror games out there on the market.",10,2020-06-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user

patdalefty,"When it comes to recent From Software games, the difficulty always seems to be one of the most common issues. But rather than describing the game as difficult, it is rather unforgiving and the sense of achievement upon getting to the next lamp or beating the next boss is something that few games apart from the Soulsborne franchise can attain. And no matter how difficult certain passages seem, there is always a way through. What elevates Bloodborne from the Souls games in my opinion is the unbeatable atmosphere. The gothic setting and Lovecraftian influences across Yharnam and further are simply amazing and you feel like being drawn into the world and even though you may first feel a sense of dread of what might linger around the next corner, you always feel like you want to see more and dive deeper into the world. The lore and plot, in true Dark Souls fashion is convoluted and that is also what makes it more intriguing in my opinion. You can find yourself for hours just reading item descriptions and looking for further clues in the world to give meaning to the game, which also leaves room for interpretation, but that's what makes it great. Apart from the story, the multitude of weapons and build options for your character makes the game extremely re-playable and, at this point, almost 5 years after release, is still one of my go-to games at any point. The pros: - The atmosphere is, in my opinion, the best that From Soft attained in a game - The gameplay and combat is sharp and to the point. - Level design leaves no wishes open. Without spoilering anything, the first area of the game is certainly among the best intro/tutorial areas ever made. - In typical From Software fashion, the background score is scarce, apart from a few areas and bosses, but it is well composed and the lack thereof in many parts makes it the more potent. - The boss design is variable and contains some of the best (and most challenging) bosses in the Soulsborne series (this review only focuses on the main game bosses, DLC is another review in itself). Especially with the chalice dungeons, you will have some tough nuts to crack and that also makes the game even greater. - Re-playability: With many games being a one-and-done, you will still find new things after mutliple playthroughs - Great graphics and scenery. - Multiplayer works well, even if it is not as much in focus as in the Dark Souls series. Cons (albeit not many): - The inventory menu is centered around the options button, whereas the touchpad is reserved for gestures and certain non-quick-use item slots. As I use the inventory menu more often (to equip weapons and equip quick-use items into slots) than the touchpad, I would like this reversed. It is sometimes hard while moving to do this when you have large fingers, especially since the game does not pause. - The chalice dungeon design, albeit intriguing, can seem repetitive at some points. - Travelling between lanterns is not possible. Instead, you have to maneuver through a hub world, which makes sense story wise, however the option of directly warping between lanterns (like between bonfires in Dark Souls) would have been beneficial, as it would save you from an extra loading screen from time to time. These cons do not in anyway justify a lower score in my opinion, and I would recommend anyone with a PS4 to get the game and play it. An absolute must-play for the PS4.",10,2020-06-22,PLAYSTATION 4,user
KarnaK,"While there is fun to be had in the challenge of combat, there are absurdly unfair areas that lead to countless cheap deaths and lost progress.

The atmosphere that make your presence in Yharnam like disturbing its peace and the enemy that lurking in every corner of this cursed city.

luisflopez,"I finally got around to play Bloodborne this year, and I'm glad to to say that it is just as good as I imagined it to be. It is basically on the same level as the other Dark Souls games, which I really enjoy, and even surpasses them in some aspects. The aesthetic is what mainly defines Bloodborne as its own separate thing within the Souls series. You don't get to see such beautiful, detailed and immersive victorian-fantasy worlds like Yharnam every day. Add From Software's expertly crafted passive storytelling and a bit of lovecraftian inspiration, and you have **** universe that is just a delight to get soaked in. It is impressive how Bloodborne, being a single game, has a lore that is just as compelling as the entire Dark Souls series as a whole. In the gameplay department, Bloodborne is a faster paced version of Dark Souls, with less emphasis on defending and more on being aggresive. Parrying was made easier than ever thanks to the inclusion of guns, and this is one the things I love the most about Bloodborne. It's going to be hard to go back to the other Souls games and not be able to parry anything. However, this doesn't make the game any easier. Bloodborne is just as difficult as any other Souls game. Another great thing about the combat is being able to regain health if you hit an enemy inmediately after taking damage, which creates this very clever risk-reward dynamic at all times. There are other slight changes to the Dark Souls formula that Bloodborne introduces, but none of them is big enough to be worth mentioning here. You're better off discovering those for yourself. The level design is a considerable step-up from Dark Souls 2, not only regarding gameplay, but the aesthetics too. Also, Bloodborne has some of the greatest bosses I've ever encountered in any video game. Another addition in Bloodborne are dungeons. Some are fixed, and some are randomly generated. Obviously, these are not on the same level of quality as the main levels, but they do offer a good bunch of extra hours, new bosses, and a good excuse to play co-op with a friend. I don't know why people bash the dungeons so much. I actually enjoyed them, even when playing alone. Speaking of online play, Bloodborne's matchmaking can be abismal at times. Also, I found PVP to be very disappointing, mainly due to the fact that it only takes a few seconds to kill/die, and a lot of time to connect again. The amount of art and creativity that went into every aspect of Bloodborne's design is both admirable and delightful. Bloodborne won't win any awards on the technical aspect, but the levels still look fantastic, they have a lot of detail everywhere. I was initially worried that all of the game's areas would look too similar given the victorian setting, but foruntately this isn't a problem. The soundtrack is also good, probably my favorite in the Souls series, along with Dark Souls 3. In the end, Bloodborne is a game I would absolutely recommend to any person who enjoys action video games, and it now sits next to Dark Souls 3 as my favorite title in the Souls series. It is a shame that it is only available on Playstation 4. Score: 9.5 --",10,2020-06-12,PLAYSTATION 4,user
DzmitryBoston,There is no particular reason to explain why developers of the game that could be beautiful and enjoyable made the game the way it is in reality. I did try but only defeated 3 bosses and all I felt all the way is pressure. This is not why I play video games. I like a challenge but not in this way. Sorry. But the video game developers should not try to prove that hardcore gaming is the way to go. They must provide options. Feel frustrated that I am not able to finish the game and enjoy the art of it.

Windolicker,"It is the best game I have ever played. It is DRIPPING with lore, atmosphere, and texture. Every symbol you see, every necklace someone wears, and every word that is **** all has meaning. Oh, you found an item? Where did you find it? Who possessed it? What surrounds you? The game demands attention to tiny details. They even give you a monocular for that purpose. I found myself looking up definitions to words I thought I already knew so that I could expand my understanding of lore descriptions. When it comes to story telling, Miyazaki and Fromsoftware have literally created a new genre of gaming. It is everything that gaming could and should be. And make no mistake, it is pure art. I won't go into the mechanics of combat and general gameplay. To me, it is absolutely flawless; crafted and finely honed to perfection. The only negative critique I have about the game is the HUD that can't be turned to ""automatic"" which was an option that was given in Dark Souls 3. It allows you to absorb the beauty of the environments and then as soon as you get into combat, the display pops up with your health bar. I deliberately have played this game slowly because I just don't want it to end. It is the best game of all time, of this I am certain. Miyazaki is the secret sauce.

However, if you don't like melee combat then it might not be the title for you - there is simply little of no choice when it comes to ranged weapons, apart from the gun that is used to stun enemies rather than deal damage.

I admit this is my first Soulsborne game and the first few deaths were very aggravating, losing all echos upon death and dying to Gascoigne 20+ times absolutely ****. However, after a few hours of getting used to the controls, the game felt livelier and new enemies felt less scary and difficult. I would proudly declare that I managed to beat BSB on my first try. For a 2015 game, the graphics aren't that bad. This is perfect if you want to play a 60h+ game for a cheap price.",10,2020-04-08,PLAYSTATION 4,user

MVMOFFICIAL,"My favourite of the Souls of FromSoftware. Although the story may seem vague, you can piece together something for yourself. The difficulty is really high, even for someone who already played Souls games. The combat is just great. One of the best combat systems in my opinion, outclassed only by Sekiro's. The game is a mixture of classic horror elements, it excellently blends many genres like gothic horror and mostly lovecraftian cosmic horror. It is also a very... ""bloody"" game. It is not ashamed of showing off streams of blood and deformed bodies. You know that a game is very violent if it has ""blood"" in the title. ANYWAYS. I will not spoil anything, go play it for yourself. Graphically... it could have been better. I don't know how it runs on a PS4 pro, but my normal version just sounds like a helicopter when i play it. It lacks dynamic lightning, making the textures look quite flat sometimes. Framerate drops when too many things are on the same screen... these things could have been polished for a better experience... but it doesn't decrease the rating at all. For the variety of enemies, weapons (which are considerably lower in number compared to Dark Souls, but are all unique with different abilities), characters and bosses, it deserves all of its praise.",9,2020-04-02,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Spartan91,"This game is part **** of games that uses ""Difficulty"" to excuse through and through **** game design. The fact that this has such a good rating is a joke. The graphics are meh, the story is meh. The gameplay is bottom of the barrel awful. Starting with the game camera that makes it pretty much impossible to see anything in a lot of situations, especially against larger Bosses where your camera will get stuck and you won't have any idea what's happening. Boss fights also frequently rely on oneshotting the player since coming up with an interesting Boss fight would have been too much effort. In general combat is another pretty big meh. You dodge, attack, dodge, attack. All of it in what's supposed to be a slow and deliberate way of fighting. Although I'm not entirely sure that was the plan since Boss fights don't entirely fit into this style. The challenge of the boss fights also feels less like the Bosses are difficult, rather that you're fighting against unresponsive controls, clunky Models and a camera that's hell bent on confusing you. The lack of checkpoints means that when you lose a boss fight (the only times losing is possible) you have to fight your way through pointless minions over and over again. This isn't a challenge, the enemies are easy to beat. It's pointlessly wasting the players time in the name of some challenge i've yet to figure out. There's no resources to waste or health to lose. Just your time. FromSoftware as a Developer has done something fascinating, they found a way to market awful game design. Using the community to silence any criticism by pretending it's all about the difficulty, the ""git gud"" attitude. And this games score shows that it works, this is why we can't have nice things.",3,2020-03-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Викторианская архитектура, отлично проработанный лор, каждое оружие имеет по два стиля, у практически всех боссов в игре есть слабые места и бой подразделяется на фазы и потрясающий саундтрек. Игра практически идеальна, кроме дизайна некоторых боссов и механики гринда расходников. Например, Амигдала - один из самых кривых и забагованных боссов во всей серии. Насчёт расходников : если во время прохождения игры вы застряли на каком либо месте, у вас могут закончиться пузырьки крови. В этом случае приходиться возврощаться и фармить отголоски( на которые нужно покупать аптечки) или сами пузырьки. Это снижает темпы прохождения и заставляет заниматься ненужным гриндом. Аптечки должны автоматически пополняться у костра(фонаря) при смерти или отдыхе. P.S. bloodborne 2 is alive!",9,2020-02-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Shimmeywill,"This is the From game I want to love oh so bad. I still believe it is the most visually impressive of all the souls game with phenomenal art and consistent quality across the board. Almost all the bosses are a visual treat and the areas are all stunning to look at. The armor sets and weapons are also consistent in quality. However, the threat of running out of blood vials made it hard to enjoy and appreciate the bosses. I would die constantly to Dark Souls bosses but still enjoy myself because I know that with time and patience, I would eventually defeat the boss. Knowing I may have to go grind for more vials removes a degree of this enjoyment and I find myself trying to beat the bosses as fast as possible. Additionally, the aesthetic and tone of the areas get a bit samey. Also, being locked on the PS4 cages the performance and load times of the game. The one, aggressive play style unlike Souls also runs counter to how I personally enjoy souls games where I like to be methodical and take my time. My frustration with this title predominantly stems from the fact that I think this is the best produced souls game, but unfortunately a few elements make this far more frustrating than the dark souls games.",8,2020-02-20,PLAYSTATION 4,user

While i would rate the bosses in the main game slightly lower than those in Dark Souls 3, Bloodborne is a special experience. It feels like the game has a soul.. a personality, and you can fall in love with it. Definitelly one of the best of what playstation has to offer. The only reason i dont give it a perfect 10, is because it could've been more polished, it has some technical problems, like framerate and bad camera placement when fighting very large bosses, and it lacks support for ps4 pro, which is a shame because playing this game in 60fps would've been awesome, though being honest, i was so immersed in the game i totally forgot about fps and resolution and i could forgive the game for all of It's short comings in the end.

LoveVideoGames,"Great video game. One of the best ones ever made. The review contains basic information about the story which shouldn't be considered spoiler. If you are too sensitive about it, If you want to jump in completely blind, don't read it. The game is not hard but challenging. Except some rare occasions, game has solid rules and after understanding them you just overcome it. This is my first souls game. I loved it so much, I just bought a physical copy even if I had it for free with psn plus. A lot of people complain about the repetitive enemies. I kinda agree with them but game has just enough challenge. Having more enemies with new attack patterns might be hard and **** the enjoyment out from the game for the first play through. Thinking about it, since i know the game very well it might be fun to have extra challenge but as i said, first play through is important. I don't know if I want to complain about it. Most of the people complain about story. There is a story and it is seriously good. I just cannot stop reading new theories. The style of the story telling is kinda odd especially if it is your first souls game but it adds a lot of mystery to the game which makes it more lovecraftian than it is. More than %99 of the games just tell the story anyway. Lets have something different. Lets think about wtf happened there after each area and explore and think about every part of the map. After doing this, there are more than enough elements to understand the story structure. Let me give you a little example here: After you are done in Central Yarnham what do you know about the game? -You are sick and came here to find a cure. -There are mostly humanoids at the streets. -There is a crucified werewolf, burning. -There is Father Gascoigne. -There is Cleric Beast. What do they tell you? The humanoids hunted the werewolf which is considered sick. Humanoids hunted them when they were humans, not when they are like this because 2 werewolves on the bridge don't attack the one humanoid on the stairs leads to the bridge. Therefore, we can assume something happened to them while the hunt is happening. Father Gascoigne is not a town folk but a legitimate, half-sane hunter (you can tell by the weapons) and you can see the transformation in front of you. What you learned here? There is a disease / curse. You are fighting with it. Wtf is Cleric Beast then? It is another story to investigate at the next area. I don't even talked about the NPCs at the area. Considering them, the story is more clear. I had experienced this kind of story telling for the first time and I loved it. It was kinda challenging itself and I loved it. If there was a guy telling me everything I solved myself, it would be just another story. Well; if you think about it, it is just a intergalactic vampire story but it narrated very well. What else... Yeah, graphics... I don't know what to tell. There are very rare areas when I felt something is wrong like stairs inside the cathedral leading to Vicar Amelia has some space shows the skybox. Other than those stuff, it was the best looking game I have ever played. Not because it was ultra realistic but because of the style. Even games like Death Stranding will look old someday but games with style like Bloodborne will always be its own thing. I haven't write these to mock anyone. My only purpose to encourage people to give it a shot. If you don't like the game, so be it but never think it is not fair and you cannot do it. You can.... The game is not a 10 for me. No game is and probably no game will ever be. But it is more than 9.5 so wouldn't be fair to give a 9.",10,2020-01-31,PLAYSTATION 4,user
RyanL9588,"I first bought this game in 2016 and quickly bounced off it due to being unable to overcome the second boss. However despite this setback I still felt strongly that Bloodborne was an excellent game because of its incredible art design, level design, and fantastic combat and hoped that one day I could experience the full game. In 2019 I finally came back to the game & completed two playthroughs in quick succession and my gut feeling back in 2016 was correct, Bloodborne is one of the greatest games of the last decade. The combat is pretty close to perfection with precise controls balanced against phenomenal enemy & boss design to create a game that gets the adrenaline pumping like nothing else outside of FromSoftware's other titles. The art design is absolutely incredible nailing the look & feel of both Bram Stoker & HP Lovecraft while synthesizing their works into the perfect nightmare. The music & sound design is also fantastic providing a perfect complement to the visuals & creating a wonderful sense of atmosphere & place. Finally the game design (level, mechanics etc.) is some of the best I have ever seen as the fear of losing blood echoes perfectly pushes against the excitement of unlocking a shortcut, new level, or a new lamp making even the most minor moments feel important. Overall this game would be a easy 10/10 as it captivated me like few games have & made me a permanent fan of FromSoftWare.",10,2020-01-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user

I played the game 3 times and i dont get bored, even with his repetitive enemies and his low possibilities of personalization, in my second game i decide just go to fight only with the bosses, because the normal enemies are such as boring, but this change a lot with the DLC (You should buy the Dlc, believe me, you wont regret it). If the Dlc was part of the original game this could be better. At least i believe the ""hunters dream"" was a nuisance, you lost a lot of time, and it's a big mistake if you consider the faster gameplay, break the dive. finally you have a easy gameplay of learn, but when you progress,you see how as difficult it could be",8,2019-12-12,PLAYSTATION 4,user
joel_tdl,"La siguiente reseña fue publicada originalmente en 3djuegos. JUGABILIDAD. Bloodborne hace un trabajo increíble a nivel jugable. Un gran sistema de combate, un bien desarrollado tinte de RPG, un buen sistema de ""puntos"" y de niveles, una abrumadora cantidad de objetos que podemos utilizar. Todo envuelto en una dificultad abrasadora. Y lo de la dificultad es serio. El juego te castiga una y otra y otra vez, llegando a ser injusto en varias ocasiones. No obstante, FromSoftware ha logrado que dicha dificultad haga del juego aún más adictivo. Los Bosses hacen su trabajo y nos estancan por varios intentos, aunque siendo justos, varios jefes de la recta final son sencillos comparados con jefes del inicio. Como punto negativo a recalcar: el 80% del tiempo la dificultad no está en el Boss/enemigo/área sino en la horrible dirección de cámara. Leí por ahí que es intencional pero yo no me lo creo, me suena a una equivocación de optimización que decidieron nunca arreglar. La historia... muy a interpretación personal. GRÁFICOS. El estilo de arte gótico es estupendo. Visualmente es una aventura en sí misma. SONIDO. Las piezas son maravillosas, aunado al estilo gótico del juego y los efectos de sonido de las distintas área y enemigos crean una atmosfera completa. INNOVACIÓN. Un Souls-like inspirado de Lovecraft. No deja de ser el típico hack&slash con toques RPG, pero eso no es malo: Bloodborne lo ha hecho maravillosamente",9,2019-12-10,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Unknown-Critic,"Trash visuals, last gen level of graphics, horrible character models and textures. Heck, MGS4 from 2008 on PS3 looks and plays better than this game. Combat is clunky as hell. This game isn't tough. It's just frustrating due to the deliberately horrible checkpointing which pushes you back to the start of the level after each death, long load times and congested environments which makes each encounter unfair for the player. If this game had proper frequent checkpointing and no stamina system then it would be not difficult at all. These games only have artificial difficulty. Actual challenging games have smart enemy A.I. Those games are challenging but still fair not like this. There is no story either and no ""lore"" does not count as story. Remove all the cutscenes and dialogue from Mass Effect and just leave the lore there and then tell me what the story actually is and not just your ""interpretation"" of it.

Compared with traditional ACT, BB is not rich in options of actions, but the combat versus strong enemies and monsters is still very very exciting. With limited options, you need to focus on the movements of you enemy, observe and think carefully, and decompose them before you can beat them. The process is definitely full of interest and challenge. Exploration is fun as well. Many NPCs, valuable side quests and props are hidden in a certain corner in the game.

MrBalbool,"Welcome to Mr. Balbool reviews. There is not anything more I can add about this game. It was one of those games that gave people a big reason to buy a ps4, it definitely stands up there with witcher as one of the best games of the decade, the combat is satisfying and smooth, the story is very complex and the game tells it in a way that doesn't spoon feed it to you, the weapons are all unique, the music is great, character creation/replay-ability is excellent and even though the game has an extremely hard difficulty this is no way a downside. The only downside I have with the game is the camera sometimes is stupid. After you've died to that same boss over and over again. You feel like giving up there's no hope left you ragequit off your ps4 and cry yourself to sleep like a ***** . But then after days of thinking about it you man up regrab that controller on a friday night literally shaking as you're approaching the boss you go through that fog and fight it to the death. At the end of the fight you feel so accomplished your heart feels like its gonna jump out of your chest, your character has like 2 blood vials left and then it reads ""PREY SLAUGHTERED"".

The game is primarily addictive with its style. Very balanced music, locations, enemies and NPCs.

D3NGZ,"at first i dropped this game due to being impatient and confused by it then i played and beaten Sekiro (which i think is a masterpiece) and decided to give BB another shot. and to my surprise, i've found one of the most in your face and beautiful worlds ever. i cant out right say its the best game ever like alot of guys say but imo Pros: + Great Soundtrack. + Great atmosphere. + amazing world and is probably the scariest non scary game ever game. just crooked and full of gore no matter where you look. + Great Combat system ( each weapon almost opens a new way to play the game ) + good RPG systems. + demands aggressiveness from you. + some bosses i found to be too easy but overall really good designed fights and mechanics on most of them. Mixed : +/- the delivery of the main plot. i mean at what point does vague become too vague? i finished the game and went HUH? what the hell just happen (other than the most obvious thing depending on your ending ofc) i had to go online right away and go deep into the Lore of the game and world they created, which is pretty amazing btw but i feel like it would be lost to most of the people. now for some of the cons - Framerate.. can dip anywhere and feels really not that smooth, the loading screens are pretty alright now after the performance patch but the framerate will still go south of 30 frequently. - the Chalice Dungeons, pretty mediocre overall nothing special -",9,2019-10-04,PLAYSTATION 4,user

UltiDK,"The game is incredible, however before I start telling why, I'll let you know that the game sure isn't for everybody, because of the very hard difficulty. Now, let's begin the review. Bloodborne stars with a short cutscene. You're about to get a blood transfusion. The game doesn't tell you why. It's also through this cutscene that you create your character. Once the cutscene is over, you awake in the room where you got the blood transfusion. You instantly get the feeling that something's wrong in the city of Yharnam. Once you get outside of the building, you'll see beasts everywhere on the streets, and will encounter several people hiding inside their hopes. Welcome to Yharnam. This is pretty much the beginning of Bloodborne. The story itself in Bloodborne is very mysterious, like in the Dark Souls games, and you'll have to figure out a lot yourself. This is one of the reasons Bloodborne is so amazing. If you explore a lot, you'll get to better understand the lore of the game, and you'll also encounter new characters and side stories. The gameplay in Bloodborne is very, very satisfying. You'll also collect many different weapons. All the weapons has two modes, normal and transformed. For example, there's a cane that can transform into a whip, or a blade which transforms into a big scythe. The real star of the game though, are the bosses, all with unique patterns, phases, and even music. Now, the game is very hard. Not only when fighting bosses, but also the regular enemies, hence why the game isn't for everyone. But, do not let this scare you off. I myself wasn't really into hard games before playing Bloodborne, but I tried it, and feel in love with it. There's just nothing comparable to the feeling of satisfaction you get once you finally beat that boss you've been stuck on for hours. The game also allows you to get help from other players if you're stuck, although I wouldn't recommend this, because it's simply more amazing beating the game on you're own. Even the graphics in Bloodborne are great, though I personally could've used some more detail on the faces, but you won't much time looking on them, so it doesn't matter. What matters though, it that you, if you haven't already, give Bloodborne a go.",10,2019-09-21,PLAYSTATION 4,user

lux192,"This the best game I have ever played, and I have played too many. The game is as rewarding as you make it. The gameplay mechanics are exemplary, the lore is better than the stories of modern classics and the environment and immersion of the game should be considered psychic driving. No matter how long I stay away from this game, I always find myself returning to it, because of the reasons mentioned above. The feeling of accomplishment after defeating a boss is the best feeling I have ever gotten from playing a video game. The fast paced combat is enough to constantly keep you on your toes and engaged. I have played the souls-series for a long time now. And after I played Bloodborne, they can't even compare. They are masterpieces in their own right, at least the first one, anyways. But they are epics. This feels more relatable. I will play this when I'm 80 and retired.",10,2019-07-31,PLAYSTATION 4,user
fordagame,"Pretty good souls like game. I really like it. Combat is interesting. Gameplay is interesting. The game is completed and it deliver what it wants to give us. Maybe only weak point in it is lore. Actually I had no clue what is happening and why. Even when game ended, I didn't understand anything. I am not fan of reading notes and description of the item, because for me this is very complicated way to show lore. But even with missing lore this didnt ruin the overall impression from the game. A bit about how hard is this game, because this was always the most important thing in souls game. In 2019 You cant find any help from people, because most likely almost noone play this game anymore, so co op player to assisst you will be extremely hard to find. But there are a lot of co op AI players around the world, who will help you with bosses. In general I am not the best souls player (I never played Dark Souls) and I found hard to parry and block attack. Used almost non consumable (except health potions and bullets of course). Passed game for around 30 hours (no dlc, no dungeons, and most likely in this labyrinth I have missed some side quests and bosses). Why I am saying this. For everyone who think that this is some over complicated game where you will wipe for hours on every boss. This is not true. Most likely their is some side bosses which are harder, but 50% of late game I have killed up to 5-6 trys. Few of them even from first try or second. I used on 4 bosses co op AI controlled ally to kill them and I am sure that on at least 2 of them I could kill without help, cos they died on second try. Is this cheat to use help? I dont know, after all thats why you have such ability in the game and if someone find hard time to kill some boss, why not. There was only 1 boss on which I wiped for about 5 hours, but after it, everything else was piece of cake. I dont see how someone can call this game very hard (and again I am talking about main plot, because side quests are easily skipable if you cant kill complete them). Maybe not the easiest one which I play, but for sure it wasn't something extra ordinary, which cant be completed with in game tools. Maybe if you are lazy to level up and you want to pass it on level 40 it wont work, but I have completed it on lvl 80-85 and it was piece of cake.",9,2019-07-29,PLAYSTATION 4,user
MorgothBauglir,"It's From Software we're talking about! Another masterpiece by the studio that keeps rocking the gaming world. Played for the first time in 2019 (bought my first PS4) and had a great time. It's scarier than most horror games, actioner than most action games and adventurer than most adventure games. The combat is fast and instigating. The enemies are extremely punishing and well designed. The map is maze-like and pretty easy to get lost which adds to the exploration and overall tension of the atmosphere. Even the graphics still hold up 4 years after it's release. The story is told in the traditional way From uses. Subtle and sparse lines of dialog sprinkled here and there, and item descriptions tell most of the plot of bloodborne. It can be confusing at times but once you wrap your head around all of it and put the pieces together you'll discover a rich and very thought provoking story. And the sounstrack, oh boy, the soundtrack... Thunderous, menacing, terrfying, glorious... are the words that come to mind when i try to describe how it sounds. 88/100, one of the best games of the generation.",9,2019-07-22,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Very unbalanced and that got worse in Sekiro. Dark Souls 3 was the last masterpiece in terms of difficulty/fun balance, but this one is a misstep with cheap and lazy designs to add difficulty spikes for no reason (see Invisible Village, as an example or the Gascoine Fight early game).

ddiabelekk,"I beated on my first try on my first game on ps4 god of war on highest difficulty and I really enjoyed god of war difficulty. I like this Bloodborne game for its combat, climate. I hate this game for making you ""run"" to bosses. Yes, you can find shortcuts and make it a bit faster. However its still a long process after you die. IMHO there should be a checkpoint before every boss. We could still lose blood for that but make it possible to not lose my precious time ""running"". The frustration from dying in boss fight is not from dying itself and being able to kill the boss. The frustration comes from having to run 1-3 minutes or having to farm again potions. If you use your pots on a fight, you then need to refarm them in order to increase your chance of winning. Of course you can do everything without pots etc. however if it's your first run and you don't want to watch Youtube of how to beat the boss and get the feeling on your ""own"" then you will probably die at boss fights at least a few times before learning its moves. The ""running"" part makes this game unbearable for me. I tried. I beated a few bosses and had pretty good fun. Really cool, unique enemies however dying part is frustrating, not because of 'difficulty' which is really a blast, but because of how game makes you run to boss. If you value your time as much as I do, then do not buy. If you have plenty of time, you like difficult games and this minus doesn't bother you then this is a great game.",4,2019-05-07,PLAYSTATION 4,user
KingVilla1n,"Вероятно лучшая игра Миядзаки. Даже не на данный момент, а вообще. Сможет ли он превзойти Bloodborne верится слабо. Игра получилась настолько атмосферной и глубокой, в том числе благодаря тому, что Миядзаки лично (будучи уже в должности директора FS) создавал концепт уровней и писал описание всех внутриигровых предметов. Такое близкое, интимное взаимодействие с проектом ощущается на всех уровнях. Это метафорическая история о животной природе человека. Это пугающие фантазии о космосе.

I'd love to see less microtransaction/mobile crud and more stuff like this, but that seems utopic right now. Like many others, I want a sequel. I know that licensing and other red tape is in play. Hopefully for PS5? Maybe? Not much else to say that other's haven't already said. It just seems strange that ""the good ol' days"" were just 4 years ago.

x96xDustyGee,"If you asked me what my favorite game would be, the answer to me is obvious. It's undoubtedly Bloodborne! No the game isn't perfect, but no game or anything ever made by man is perfect. I'm 22 years old and have played everything from 8 bit Megaman to Shadows Die twice. So what makes Bloodborne the standout? EVERYTHING. For one, the combat just feels... right. It's an amazingly simple system compared to other action games like Ninja Gaiden, but the fact that every hit inflicted or taken counts towards victory or failure, the mechanics of the game push you to ascend to expertise without rarely feeling artificial. The beginning is rough. You're gonna die. You're gonna die again before you can pick up your dropped experience points, and thus lose them forever. You might lose 50,000 blood echoes or more during an unfortunate run. You're going to run out of healing items, bullets, weapon buffs, your weapon might even break mid-fight. It's okay, because without these potential failures, Bloodborne wouldn't be so rewarding. So damn satisfying. Everything about the game, from the map design, lack of an in-game map, the enemy placements and design, down to your very core abilities as an immortal hunter pushes you to fail, then succeed. Once you have the ins and outs figured out, you'll be dodging, rolling, swinging and parrying with ease, instinctively. You'll learn not to think, but react. You'll memorize huge landscapes and know them just like your local streets, weaving from zone to zone, methodically juking enemies when you prefer not to fight. You'll learn to use your blood echoes effectively. Before you learn, you'll ****, but once you find your feet, you'll be slaying beasts effectively from mobs to larger than life bosses. Is it worth the time to get good? Is the initial dying phase worth the headache? YES. This game isn't for everyone, but it's the game for me. Twisted, macabre beasts prowl every nook and cranny of Yharnam. Bosses tower over you and force you to play methodically, if you mash buttons you will not succeed. NG+ cycles keep the difficulty fresh, and it's infinitely replayable because there are so many combinations of playstyles and tactics that 250+ hours in across four characters, I'm still perfecting my runs and trying various tactics that once seemed beyond my abilities. Whenever I buy a new game, once I beat it or get bored, I almost always go back to Bloodborne. It's like Resident Evil 4, but with big swords and cleavers and a give no mercy attitude. I can't stress it enough-- 250 hours, and I'm nowhere near being done with the game. I'll still be playing it 20 years for now I'm sure. Yes, it has frame pacing issues. Yes, farming for vials can be tedious. Yes, the chalice dungeons pretty much ****. It's not perfect. But it's pretty damn close and I think it's going to take quite, quite a lot for another game to take my #1 spot.",10,2019-04-20,PLAYSTATION 4,user

ZenoX,"Lets get the obvious out of the way, it's a From-Soft game so it's going to be hard. For people who played the Souls series before hand there may be a bit of a learning curve, especially if you leaned towards using a shield. This game promotes and in some cases does outright demand that you learn to dodge and USE YOUR GUN! Your gun is used to parry enemies and unlike the souls series, almost ALL are parry-able (with some obvious exceptions). I've got multiple friends who tried to play Bloodborne and said it was unfair and when I watched them play they almost never dodged, NEVER parried, and forgot that stamina was a thing. This would have ruined the game for them, but when I told them about these mechanics they quickly fell in love with the game. Hbomberguy, while I disagree with some of his points (not using shields is the right way to play, chalice dungeons are terrible etc), he makes a lot of good points to why Bloodborne is a great game and goes much more in depth than my dumb one.

Capollyon,"After 4 years reading negative reviews I decided to add one more positive opinion to another 8433 ratings. THIS GAME IS BLOODY MASTERPIECE! And I am not fan of Dark Souls. I have never played anything from ""From Software"" and I am more God of War type of player, or ... I was. At very beginning I felt same guys as you... I died a looot of times. I wanted to give up as after hours of playing I was not able to pass the mob around burning tree. This game will give you no explanation on what happened and why you are there. Control and combat system is not what I was used to from another games, but after getting used to it I can say it is very precise and comfortable, aggressive and brutal. For God of War type players it is truly frustrating to be in Yharnam without any magic or demigod powers. You are just a man with big axe against beasts out of imaginaton. Once I started to dig in, gain more experience on how does this game work and I explored the FANTASTIC lore I GOT BEST GAME EXPERIENCE. The lore is the best I have ever seen. This is true HORROR. Hollywood completely forgot what HORROR genre represents. It is not **** zombies, too much blood or screen jumpers. It is about this complete feeling of dread, fear to move forward or backwards because you can lose everything you accomplished... this game elevated lovecraftian horror to the new level and developed all Lovecraft's sketches in the best and most original adaptation ever. Yes, now I am bloody fan of it. Complete lunatic! You may think this game is not for you. I got it. It is not for everyone. But please, keep your weeping thoughts for yourself.

Wrath_4givnez,"This one is a long time coming, a very unnecessary review, and probably incredibly biased. But, whatever, I can't help it... Let's start off by saying that I only ever got to play this game a year and some change after its release. I never had a PS4 around its launch, and everyone was talking about this new Sony exclusive that came from the minds behind Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 1 (two games I have a very high respect and love for, with the latter formerly taking up the number 2 spot on my favorite games list of all time.). So, the anticipation for this grungy, gothic, action-RPG adventure with an emphasis on horror was nigh unbearable. And once I finally did play it, oh wow... Gameplay: If anyone's a fan of the ""Souls"" style of gameplay, then this has it as a standard, but there are a few twists and changes that expertly transform it into an aggressive fight for survival. Weapons, though limited in quantity, are unique, varied, relatively swift to utilize, and always have the ability to transform into something brutal, setting up for impressive combos in a way that hasn't really been attempted in the FromSOFT Souls series before or since. Sidearms have a satisfying kick to them, and all have their pros and cons, but all demand a try to see if they suite your playstyle. Enemies are varied and vicious from the mundane to the grotesque. Bosses are monumental events of pure terror (aside from maybe one boss battle). And even after you've scoured and picked clean the main game and the DLC, there's still the randomly generated Chalice Dungeons if you want a little extra challenge and bang for your buck. This isn't even talking about the still very much alive multiplayer scene. Hell, even if you can't get a session started with a random, you can always call up your buddies, set up a password system, and go from there! Bloodborne has its variety in such a simple and rock solid way. Story: Like all FromSOFT ""Souls"" games, the basic story is simple, but the devil is in the details. You are a sick outsider, trying to find a cure for an unknown illness you have, finding your way to Yharnam, a ""city of healing"". However, in order to get into the city and even have a chance to be cured, you must join ""The Hunt"". Once given a blood transfusion as your initiation, the nightmare begins, and it's your task to solve the city's secrets, and survive. From the visual aspects of the game, to NPC chatter, right to item descriptions, you'll be learning far more about this land of terror than you'd ever want to know. Visuals: The whole world is this beautiful symphony of Victorian Gothic and Lovecraftian horror, highly and disgustingly detailed with all sorts of nuances that paints a very vivid and very disturbing picture of a city with a miracle cure gone wrong. It will all seem relatively classic and tame at first, but the further you dive in, the more twisted and maddening the world becomes, and every local will hit you with some unexpected and recognizable (and sometimes strangely beautiful) design inspired by various subgenres to horror, and keep you immersed even as your slaying bloodsoaked monsters. If you aren't a fan of horror, then this may just steer you away from the get go... With all this said, there are a few visual bugs that attempt to pull you from the immersion, but they are few and far between and not THAT big of an issue. Final: Dark Souls 1 was my second favorite game of all time, for its open ended story telling, satisfying gameplay, and interesting locals. However, from the moment I played this game to the time I put it down for a short time, Bloodborne has long since taken that spot, blowing it away in nearly every category, and injected itself into my life and the lives of millions of players around the world. It is one HELL ****, and perhaps the best survival horror action RPG you'll ever play (as if there are many that would even attempt and successfully execute such a tricky balance). Oh, and if you're an old school gamer and loved Nightmare Creatures back in the N64/PS1 era, this game is also for you.",10,2019-02-15,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Sagaris918,"Here are my thoughts after finishing the main story and the DLC. Good: + boss fights are satisfying, even epic in some cases + difficulty is well balanced, the game is hard but not unfair + OSTs are really good + like in Souls games the story/lore is interesting but mostly hidden, so there's room for the players to discuss and speculate Bad: - the world is rather repetitive and monochromatic. Everything is dark, gory and disturbing, with very few exceptions (the DLC is way better in this respect) - the combat feels a little laggy and clunky, probably due to the low frame rate - scenarios are well detailed but feel ""empty"", there's barely any secret or chance of interaction - gameplay gets repetitive after a while. The only interesting mechanic is the parry/riposte with the fire gun, which is highly effective but needs to be mastered (that's not a bad thing) - a big portion of the story/lore is revealed in the chalice dungeons, which are procedurally generated. As a result, every floor looks the same and has the same rooms. I quit after beating the Watchdog, because I couldn't stand it anymore Conclusions: boss battles and story/lore are what kept me interested until the end. Everything else either disappointed me or left me unimpressed. I give it a 6 (5 points for the main game and 1 bonus point for the DLC, which is by far the best part of the game IMO). If you really like the kind of atmosphere this game delivers, you'll probably enjoy it a lot more than me.",6,2019-02-04,PLAYSTATION 4,user

rednutgaming,seems like a good game brilliant graphics and the environment and npc look very cool. The only problem is the difficulty is through the roof ridiculously hard for a player that is new to the series like myself. You die all the enemies re spawn back to the original spots which is fair but all your consumables are lost which i thought was a little whacked...other things include the lock on system is very clunky and can sometimes lead to your downfall. The enemies can kill you through stairs rails ect. All in all this game does very well at alienating new players and if you don't want to slog it out for a few hours killing the same people going over the same places then this game probably isn't for you...i tried my hardest to give this game every chance but its just not my cup of tea but in saying that it has a healthy community so maybe i'm not the norm.,4,2019-01-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user

DotakuReview101,"Bloodborne is Bloody Fun! I picked this game up back when it first came out and instantly fell in love. When I got home from school I would immediately jump back in and play it nonstop, sometimes staying up way later than I should. So just how good was it? Well... Pros - Where do I even start? Okay well first off the game looks absolutely gorgeous even by today's standards, seriously I can boot this up right now and still adore every inch of the beautifully crafted city of Yarnham, a city that feels like a mash of H.P. Lovecraft and Victorian England. The games great look coupled with the amazing sound design means the games atmosphere is just as chilling as you'd expect given the games setting, this game is just oozing with amazing atmosphere. The game play is honestly my favorite out of any of the Souls games. It has the same extremely difficult but rewarding combat of the other games but with a more action heavy, more fast paced twist. Unlike the games before it blocking isn't really taken into consideration but instead super fast reaction times and pattern memorization. Also it definitely feels pretty cool to equip your Hunter with more powerful weapons and armor as well as leveling them up using Blood Echoes (this game's version of souls) but it never makes you feel to powerful so simply leveling up can help in a fight but won't make or break a fight. Much like the Dark Souls game you can find notes from other players that may or may not be helpful, its cool but you'll ignore more often than not. Some may take issue with the very bare bones story that is really only told through the occasional NPC and collectible but honestly I love it. The fact that most of it is hidden away and told mostly through vague lines actually adds to the mysterious lovecraftian feeling of the game. Cons - I honestly don't have that many cons with this game. There was the long loading screens at launch but those have since been fixed. I suppose if I had to nitpick I could point out how It could've been a bit longer but that's really **** the bottom of the barrel. Verdict - I absolutely adore this game. Seriously it's not just one of my favorite games of this generation but one of my favorite games of all time. It's amazing to look at, amazing to listen to, and amazing to play. It's also got a pretty cool DLC. If you haven't played this yet than you really need to because you are missing out, it's part of the Greatest Hits collection so you should be able to get it relatively cheap.",10,2019-01-18,PLAYSTATION 4,user

PaulSeralt,"This is one of the best PS4 games out there. A must have. If you loved Dark Souls games, you'll love this one too. If you never played a Dark Souls before, this game is a great fast action horror rpg with focus on melee. PRO - the lore, is very good and interesting ; - the setting is fantastic; - the gameplay is fast and fun, hard but not frustrating; - some of the best boss fights out there; - the game is pretty long (depends on how much you explore and how good you are, i would say at least 35 - 40 hours without the dlc) and have replayability; - hard but fair; - the trick weapons are a lot of fun! CONS - few suitable builds, especially in the first run: going tanky or magician or longranged is not impossible, but harder than other Souls games and with not a lot of options; - the pvp is a little lacking and coventants not fleshed out;",10,2019-01-13,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Onask,"Por fin me he atrevido a introducirme en el género establecido por la saga Souls y qué menos que comenzar por la obra más llamativa (en mi opinión) de Miyazaki: Bloodborne. Todos los juegos de este corte (Dark Souls, Lords of the Fallen, The Surge, etc.) nunca me han llamado, ni en jugabilidad ni en gameplay como tal, pues me considero un jugador más de acción directa, aunque me encanten los RPG. Bien. Con Bloodborne he aprendido que este tipo de juegos (especialmente la obra de Miyazaki) requieren su tiempo y reflexión. Me explico: Bloodborne, al igual que los Souls imagino, es un juego que te pide más a tí como jugador de lo que tu le puedes pedir a él, y no me refiero a que te pida habilidad a la hora de hacer frente a los combates. No. Bloodborne te pide que te sumerjas, que te dediques cada minuto que juegues en cuerpo y alma a la obra. Te pide que aprecies cada rincón del impresionante diseño de niveles que tiene (sinceramente uno de los mejores que he visto jamás en un videojuego), te pide que te intereses por su lore; te pide mucho más de lo que puedes esperar de él. Resumiendo, Bloodborne roza la excelencia en prácticamente todos sus apartados: sensacional diseño de escenarios, ambientación y gameplay, así como de su estilo artístico e historia. La gran mayoría de bosses y los lugares que exploras hasta combatirlos son sencillamente sublimes. Pero no todo es un camino de rosas en Bloodborne, puesto también tiene fallos y algunos no entiendo cómo ni por qué, y son el motivo de por qué a este título no le voy a poner un 10 de nota. No puedo comprender por qué no se han dignado siquiera con lo impresionante que es el resto del juego técnicamente a meter unas simples animaciones faciales para ningún PNJ: no mueven ni siquiera la boca al hablar. Una vez más, el diseño de los personajes que el jugador puede crearse son horribles y si bien es cierto que el 95% del juego te lo vas a pasar con un casco, yelmo o máscara en la cabeza chirría muchísimo lo dejada que está la creación del personaje. También, personalmente, he tenido a veces ciertos fallos con las hitboxes del escenario tanto con mis ataques como con los de los enemigos, y como muchos saben, un golpe en estos títulos puede suponer la vida o la muerte. Me ha encantado perderme durante varias horas por los asombrosos escenarios, explorar hasta el último rincón de cada zona e incluso el farmeo de ecos de sangre que debería ser algo 'tedioso'. He disfrutado cada segundo que he pasado jugando a Bloodborne. Sin duda, uno de los mejores títulos exclusivos del catálogo de PlayStation 4. PD: Tampoco es tan difícil si tienes algo de paciencia, y aun no teniéndola como yo, no me he enfadado ni una sola vez en más de 35-40 horas que me ha durado la aventura. Imprescindible.",9,2018-12-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Blaxmagister,"CONTROVERSIAL. I like more Dark Souls. It is a better game. Not to say i didn't enjoy Bloodborne. It was my first soulsborne game. I really said it's a good game. But after playing dark souls 3, i think that game is better buy much. The bossfights felt a lot better. Bloodborne felt to me very linear. dark Souls 3 too, but you can kill the dancer of the boreal valley right from the beggining and grab some chunks. Go to the DLC to pick shards and slab and you can have many ways of playing the game. Also, i felt so little variety in Bloodborne.

skthegreat,"My entire life, since I was 8 years old, I've played video games. Hours and hours across different platforms. I can undoubtedly say Bloodborne is one of the greatest games I've ever played, and I can confidently say that it is one of the greatest games of all time. First allow me to get this out the way, the reason I created a Metacritic account in fact. I saw a review where someone claimed the story was weak, and how the ending felt cheap to them. Without delving into spoilers, I assure you, that reviewer is an irredeemable moron. This game has some of the most in-depth lore, story and themes I've ever encountered in a video game. Paragraph long item descriptions oozing with detail about the world, in addition to the subtle implications of a changing game world as the narrative progresses. I don't wish to expose things which should be discovered by the player, so moving onto gameplay, which too, is phenomenal. Dying unfairly is not a thing. Every enemy poses a threat, from the rats in the sewer to the most monstrous abominations the size of buildings. The sounds and movements they make are truly disturbing. Animations are spectacular, hitboxes are perfection, and I have yet to play a game that does atmosphere better. Horror should horrify, and Bloodborne does that. It does it better than every horror movie. It never resorts to jump-scares, yet manages to instill a fear of the unseen and the oncoming. Bloodborne is insidious, and it is the pinnacle of game design. The interconnected architecture of Yharnam, to the labyrinth which is the Forbidden Woods, everything has been laid out in accordance to progression and purpose, suiting both the player and the world of the game. To me it's baffling how someone could think Bloodborne is light on story. It's a shame when people don't understand the depth of this game. I have nearly a 100 hundred hours clocked, and I still have things to do. It just never gets boring. It has a sense of discovery the first time you play it, and the much desired quality of replay-ability. I've never gone out of my way to start a new game plus before. If you don't have a ps4, I can recommend buying one just for this game. A true masterpiece. Must play.",10,2018-11-29,PLAYSTATION 4,user

DestanyZero,"People giving this a low score because its too hard for them. if you are not good at the game you shouldn't give it a score plain and simple. Bloodborne,early into this game you can relate very well with the title. Although the lore and story of the game is definitely very mysterious, the main appeal is the combat system. You too afraid to play a game on a high difficulty? Bad luck, you dont really have much choice here. it is very hard to explain how this makes someone feel especially when you are new to this type of gameplay,it is very intimidating at first as you would expect for a horror/gothic game that has monsters and demons wanting to kill you around every corner. You will be dying in this game quite alot and that also means to the people who claim or feel they have the confidence to go through it quite easily. that is also the appeal in its way,with every death you will learn and adapt,with every hit and every movement the enemy makes you will slowly but surely start to read their movements,doing so you actually do feel like a true hunter. You may die....alot,during encounters and even boss encounters. But the draw to it is the sense of accomplishment, yes we all know how much that EA quote cringes us. But in all seriousness,when you actually defeat a boss the feeling you have is definitely that, you feel as if the battle was earned. That you defeating that boss was well deserved and you feel in yourself as if you are getting better and better and more knowledgeable within your journey. The more time you invest in the game, the more you improve. this is by no means for everyone and there will be some who just can not bear the learning curve and will stop playing this game from frustration and not being able to adapt and improve that is a given. But for those who really want to test themselves and want to see just how great **** they really are,this is definitely the game to pick up to test your skills,reactions and adaptions. You have multiple weapons to choose from and yes you can die very easily and you will...plenty of times, but you too can kill enemies very quickly as well so you are on a even ground here. Although this game might scare some because they may feel hesitant from its difficulty,now when the game is at such a low price i believe you should purchase this and experience this yourself. The first few hours may be frustrating,but with that frustration comes a great sense of accomplishment, it will not only expand your mind from the monsters and demons you encounter,but you too will feel some sort of love for the horror franchise after playing this game,well.....i did at least. well worth the money spent. even with the few flaws that are in it, it is well worth your time.",9,2018-11-07,PLAYSTATION 4,user

However, the environment and enemies doesn't change much, its much of the same. A few bosses are very good, others not much. The game is very hard, specially at the beginning, but not harder than DK3 or Nioh. One thing that made me very angry: after you end the game, you can't choose between going back to the current history to explore (example - DLC), you're automatically driven to the NG+.

SplitMind,"While there is much hype around Bloodborne, especially due to the difficulty, once the novelty wore off I found the game slightly tedious, repetitive and protracted. The graphics are pretty good and the gothic atmosphere is excellent. My issue is that it becomes one-dimensional without much variety in colour palettes other than the sky. I get that is supposed to be a dark, gothic game, but some variety could still have helped. The architecture of the buildings is fantastic, but the lack of colour literally tars them all with the same brush. The story here is odd. You can pretty much delve as deep as you like into the lore or ignore it for the gameplay. I did like this choice but even when you want to learn more about the story it's rather opaque and obfuscated. The gameplay is the heart of this game, and where I have the most mixed feelings. Yes, it CAN be hard, but not necessarily. A lot of it comes down to the usual observing patterns of attack, looking for an opening and exploiting a weakness. No matter how far I seemed to level up, my character could be killed in just a few hits, which whilst challenging was also counter-intuitive to the purpose of levelling up. I found myself looking up YouTube guides far too often when I should have been playing and enjoying the game. You can summon for help if you are online which is also a nice way to balance out the difficult but it detracts from the experience a bit. It's not often I say this but I think Bloodborne may actually be TOO long. After about 2/3 to 3/4 of the game I was sick of it and wanted it to be over. Everything had become patterned and the difficulty spikes became cheaper and more annoying rather than challenging. So called 'hardcore' players seem to adore this game, and for the first half of the game I'd agree, but as it progressed it became a subject of vanity and masochism. Don't be put off by difficulty. Just be prepared to invest time and learn how to play it properly. If that still appeals to you then you have a very decent game at a decent price these days.",6,2018-10-11,PLAYSTATION 4,user
TredZ,"I tested this game because it was with the psn plus and the high score from this site. What a deception. This is not a game for me. This is a game for punishment, try, die, retry and re-die and more and more difficult because you lose your used items after dying. The story is absent, you start the game you know nothing, you have to find the ""tutorial"". The attacks are hazardous, slow. If you like boss and patterns, with no story, learn everything by heart to beat the boss, then this is surely a game for you.",1,2018-10-07,PLAYSTATION 4,user

tomvs123,"What this game does better than any previous game is atmosphere. It wonderfully portrays its atmosphere of lovecraftian horror through its art style, world, music, characters, dialogue, voice acting, and vague story. It starts out strong and somehow manages to get even better by the end of the game. I'd actually find myself sitting for half an hour or so, in the starting area, just talking to the doll and being immersed the the world. The voice acting for the doll is incredible and the rarity of her lines makes them all the better. Besides that, the gameplay is simplified over the Dark Souls counterparts. This is good for me, since it gives me more time to focus on the world rather than trying to optimize gear. It's also a bit less difficult than Dark Souls to me, although that may be because I was so compelled to see the rest of the world, that I just naturally became better. The only downsides to me is that it feels a bit too video-gamey at points, with enemies who are apparently just lined up in places, waiting for you to do video game stuff (combat) with them. The story is also just a bit too vague, requiring you to read loads of item descriptions, after collecting hard-to-find items. Some of those descriptions are much more important than others. I found it was much easier to just read a wiki externally from the game. Giving options to keep this experience in-game would have been better. Overall, I'd say it's the best atmospheric game to date. It's a must play if you like dark atmospheres and you're prepared for the challenging combat.",9,2018-10-03,PLAYSTATION 4,user

adrewtoremember,"Take the deeply challenging, and rewarding style that From Software has become synonymous with in recent years, inject it with major Lovecraftian horror elements, and an increase in the pace of combat, and you are left with Bloodborne, one of the paramount experiences on the PS4. You take control of a customized hunter tasked with one thing, ""Seek the Paleblood."" With that you are thrust into the savage, gothic city of Yharnam. In my journey, I spent time piecing together the lore from one of the greatest settings in a modern game. Learning about the connections of major characters and factions in the universe was nearly as rewarding as the combat. Speaking of combat, those familiar with From Software titles know that rushing into a fight will nearly always end in tragedy. However, in Bloodborne the new combat system, which focuses on parries and dodging, enables a high risk, high reward style of gameplay to be adopted. The city of Yharnam holds countless numbers of all manners of horrors to encounter in your journey, with the city slowly going more insane as the story progresses. The amount of enemy variety in the game should be applauded, with each new area you explore usually housing new enemy types that require new strategies to be adopted in order to overcome. Memorable bosses have become a staple of From Software games, and Bloodborne is no different. Boss types can be slow and crushingly strong, spell slingers, to lightning fast and able to catch you in a combo, with no 2 bosses feeing the same. All in all, I did not find this title as difficult as others in the From Software library due to my specific play style and preferences. Between the gorgeous world, grotesque and intriguing enemies, memorable bosses, and deep lore steeped in Lovecraftian influence, this game is a must play if you own a PS4.",10,2018-08-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user

hiltong55,"So let me start by saying that this is not generally the kind of game I usually enjoy playing so I guess my opinion is coming from an outsiders perspective to the genre. After getting through the initial learning curve I did find myself really getting into and enjoying many of the defining gameplay elements that make Bloodborne the highly regarded title that it has come to be. Let's start with the two things about the game I loved. First, the combat system. This is what melee style combat should be like in any game of this style. Difficult to master but feels very rewarding once you do. I liked how all the weapons felt unique (although my favorite was the ax because of its range). Your sidearm (if you used correctly) can be used to set up perry attacks which become vital later on in the game when you take on tougher enemies. Second, the enemies. There are so many different kinds of enemies and they all have unique combat styles. I found myself pausing every time I came across a new enemy solely due to the fact that I had no idea how they were going to attack me. In addition to the great grunt style enemies, the bosses are great as well. The art design of each boss is very unique and they all look terrifying. Also, not one of them is a pushover. They feel like actual bosses. Some other things that I would like to point out that are positives in my opinion. The atmosphere. It really has that gothic look and feel. The game's artwork looks great and if you are into this time early Victorian period (I am not) I could see how you could easily fall in love with this world. Also, I really liked how the game did not punish you by allowing you to pick up items even after you items on hand count was full. They just go into your stash in the hunter's dream (took me a while to figure that out because I'm an idiot). Lastly, I appreciated the fact that you could call on other players to get through a tough boss. Helps with the very sluggish pace that the game can present to players like me. Now let's get to the stuff that people like me who are not into this style and genre did not enjoy. Wholly crap is this game tough to figure out at first. Now I will be the first to complain if I feel like a game is holding your hand but boy does this game take that type of complaint to heart. If you new to this genre and style I highly suggest at least looking at some sort of tips for beginners guide on this game or you are going to be very lost and confused. I know many people who told me they couldn't figure out how to get past the first beast in the clinic (I did at least figure this out on my own). Just maybe a tad (no more though) of guidance would be helpful to new players. Next, despite what I have read in other reviews I found this game to have many bugs that (although many did help me) took away from the great combat action and allowed me to win via bs glitches. For example, the first fight or second in my case with Father Gascoigne he got stuck behind a dam railing in one of the corners and we could not attack each other via melee. I had to shoot him and thankfully I had enough ammo. This happened multiple time later in the game and allowed me to win and sometimes lose due to unpolished environments and enemy AI. Last and to me the most killer negative to me was the lack of a captivating story. Now I understand that a story is not really what this game is going for but for players like me, I need something more captivating than what this game gives us. You are just thrown into this world with little explanation and you finish with even less explanation as to why you did what you did. This game is definitely worth a try if you have never played a game like this but I do not see it bringing in a new audience of people like myself. It is definitely a love letter to the already established audience. I got through the main storyline and I think that is enough for me but I can easily see how someone who gets invested in this world could rate this game an 8 or 9. For me it is a 7. I liked it but did not fall in love with it. 7/10 good game for players like me.",7,2018-07-26,PLAYSTATION 4,user

jrdnnn,"My favourite PS4 game by a mile, and safely in my top 5 videogame experiences ever, Bloodborne is a masterpiece. The gothic world, the multi-faceted story, the rich combat system, the music, the level design, the horror elements, the RPG elements, the weapons, the boss designs, the atmosphere...everything is top notch. This is a game that has insurmountable effort poured into its production and I really don't think I can fault it. It's perhaps a little alienating to new fans, but this is true throughout all of From Software's games - the rewards within far outweigh the learning curve, and once you're comfortable, you're engrossed. I spent so much time reading up extra bits of lore in this game, and it occupied so much of my free time even outside playtime - a mark of a fantastic game. Of course, this game comes with the Souls series seal of approval in the challenge section but to be honest, this game is much more manageable than Dark Souls 1 and 3 in the respect that I think there are no unfair bosses. I managed to defeat every single boss (main game, DLC and optional), perhaps after many attempts, but always managed. It nails the ""tough but fair"" epithet. Some bosses are BRUTAL, and not necessarily all at the end. There's always a chance to strengthen yourself, learn the enemies' patterns, and come back victorious to feel pure ecstasy when you overcome a once-impossible task. I cannot recommend this game enough, and cannot overstate how much more there is to it than meets the eye. Small character side-quests provide emotion, extra boss fights provide more backstory, more level areas provide environmental expansion, and the entire package comes in a tight, bloodied, black gothic bow. The most complete videogame experience I've had this generation, mostly thanks to the astounding DLC - this is how you do additional content for games. The DLC rounds of the deep lore of the series so nicely and is essential to play, hosting 3 of the best bosses in the entire game. Beginning NG+ ASAP.",10,2018-07-11,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Ich bin begeistert von Artdesign, Kampfsystem, Weltaufbau & Co und mir gefällt sowohl das Prinzip der Zufallsdungeons als auch die Multiplayer-Komponenten für bis zu drei Leute: Ihr könnt mit- oder gegeneinander in Bossduellen oder Kerkern antreten. In Letzteren kommen auch fiese Fallen hinzu. Der Schwierigkeitsgrad ist leichter als noch in Demon's Souls, aber trotz des neuen Komforts und vieler Heiltränke, bleibt das Abenteuer je nach Spielweise nicht nur angenehm fordernd, sondern kann ganz böse überraschen. Freut euch auf Figuren mit teilweise mehrstufigen Aufgaben und tragische Konsequenzen. Die Ladezeiten, Kollisions- sowie Bildratenprobleme sind ärgerlich, aber dafür entschädigt die Kulisse mit teilweise verwunschener Schönheit und Bosskreaturen mit spektakulären Auftritten. From Software bleibt sich treu und inszeniert auch auf PlayStation 4 situativen Nervenkitzel in einer rätselhaften Horrorwelt.",9,2018-05-01,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Graphics are amazing, gameplay one of the best ive ever played, but i could not have so much fun cos the game wont forgive you by your mistakes. This is a game for hardcore users, you cant choose easy, normal or hard mode. The only mode is HARD, and if you dont like it, so its your problem. If you like casual games, rpg with dialogue, classes, magic, customization, STAY AWAY from Bloodborne.",10,2018-04-20,PLAYSTATION 4,user
BurninZane,"This game is absolutely amazing, and well worth adding to any collection. It is difficult, very difficult! But once you get passed the first Boss or two you will start to get the hand of the game mechanics, you find your feet and start engaging in the hunt. The level of detail from your character to the stages and the enemies are exceptional. The sound score is amazing! The sheer tension that game can bring is what makes it one of the best games i have ever played. Nothing beats the feeling of beating a boss that has crushed you many times before. Yes it is hard, but it is fair and very rewarding. A must have for any and every true gamer.",9,2018-04-20,PLAYSTATION 4,user
HTGamer,"Bloodborne is a masterpiece, made by the Dark Souls series creator Hidetaka Miyazaki. Bloodborne is set in the gothic 18th century-inspired world of Yharnam, where a bloodborne epidemic has plagued its citizens and transformed them into crazed monsters and grotesque beasts. Everything from the world architecture and clothing, to the enemies design and soundtrack, to the story and lore, oozes a horrifying atmosphere, like that of HP Lovecraft's novels. Bloodborne is a faster and more offensive-minded game than Dark Souls. Shields are mostly gone but in their place you got a gun to stun your enemies. When you take damage you have a short amount of time to counterattack and heal yourself with the damage you dealt, but otherwise you can heal with blood vials (unlike Dark Souls' Estus flasks, vials can be farmed). There are far fewer weapons than in Dark Souls, but each one in Bloodborne changes into 2 forms, and can be leveld up and customised with gems, giving them different buffs. Enemies are varied, ranging from humans to monsters and beasts, and when in numbers they can easily kill you, but the boss fights are the game's high point. There is no Ornstein & Smough standout, but the quality of the boss fights is consistently very high. As always you can engage in co-op and invasions. The main campaign is admittedly shorter than that of the Dark Souls games. To counter this, there are the Chalice Dungeons to explore, where you seek higher level gear (gems, runes and an exclusive weapon) and there are also boss fights unique to this mode. The Chalice Dungeons are another game on their own, and tie into the game's lore. The soundtrack is absolutely epic. There is a whole orchestra and choir, which produce a music that will both haunt and inspire you during your adventure. Bloodborne is one of the best games ever made. Graphics, gameplay, art and music, all of them converge in a holistic way to produce a masterpiece ****. There are two issues. First is the game's poor frame pacing which produces judder. Second, the story is awesome but it's unfortunately buried in the item description screens. There are many characters and little stories to be found but you are told nothing. You are only shown a handful of cut scenes but they are not enough to explain the plot. I recommend people watch fan-made Youtube videos explaining the game's lore and plot. Rest assured Bloodborne is a fantastic game. Please do yourself a favor and get the Old Hunters DLC expansion, too. It's not just more of the same. It elevates the game to an even higher level.",10,2018-04-19,PLAYSTATION 4,user

HENCHMAN,"I've never feared death...until, Bloodborne. This game is absolutely terrifying. Not so much scary but terrifying in the sense of knowing death is around the corner and will respawn you at the beginning. I often found myself taking breaks before the next section which I fell victim to multiple times to prepare myself for the battle and calm my nerves. There is no such thing as playing a quick game in Bloodborne, you finish a whole section or you don't. The previously mentioned points are parts of what makes this game great and so frustrating at the same time. It is the only game I've played as an adult that has given a true send of reward and appreciation for advancing. I picked this game up 2-3 years ago and quit because I couldn't get past Central Yharnam. I didn't understand the mechanics really, found it confusing. Despite that, I knew it was a good game so came back to it. In total, I've spent about 15 hours on Central Yharnam which includes accessing both sides of the bridge and killing those two fully transformed beasts. It will be many years before another game like this comes along. It's really not for this generation of loot/reward based grinders, although there are some from this generation will see the goodness that lies within. Gone are the days where you spend days on one part **** and your only reward is gratification, and you desire nothing else. This is a game about the GAME, not simply chasing after the next coolest piece of gear that will be worthless when the next drops. Finally, the artwork, textures, and sounds all blend together in perfect unison.",10,2018-04-15,PLAYSTATION 4,user

ElSeano89,"The word ""masterpiece"" is bandied about a lot in the user reviews for this game and with good reason, Bloodborne is one of the best games of this generation of consoles. Jaw dropping in scale, ambition and execution there isn't a dull moment from beginning to end. Stepping away from the slower pace of the combat in the Souls series, where you are rewarded for being patient and waiting for an opportunity Bloodborne actively encourages you, in fact almost requires you, to play aggressively. Lost health can be recovered in a very short window after taking damage by attacking the enemy back. As such it is in your best interest to be pushing the pace as opposed to waiting and pouncing. There is still need for a player to be smart and evasive being as there are no shields (or rather one shield bad enough to get the point across you aren't supposed to be using one) but the mixture of the fast pace with crisp, responsive controls makes for one of the best combat systems ever. Fights are entertaining even with basic level mob enemies but bigger enemies or bosses become breathless, frantic battles to the death. The combat is a perfect example of being easy to use but difficult to master and the level of satisfaction you get from getting to the level of being able to consistently parry enemies and just generally wreck the wide variety of creatures and abominations thrown at you is immense. The game design is second to none and makes a strong case for being the best FromSoftware ever made. There are an endless array of enemies and each feels unique to fight against and their design is incredible, iconic even. Boss battles abound of course and they would rank highly amongst all the bosses of the Souls series which is no small praise. The sound design, level design, graphics are all absolutely top notch. The world is varied and beautiful, full of little hidden shortcuts and nooks and crannies that beg to be explored. The boss battles are accompanied by fantastic, booming orchestral scores that make each fight feel like the climatic battle scene of the best fantasy movies. The plot is far easier to follow and interpret than the Souls games, they do a bit more hand-holding and cut-scene explanation and its a good thing because the lore and the world is expansive and interesting to learn about. PvP is expectedly brilliant and still heavily populated 3 years after release which speaks to the quality and replay-ability this game has, you'll rarely be waiting long to summon a player and doing so can make for some brilliant gameplay moments. But what I really love about BB is that it takes a few risks, it bucks convention. These sorts of games usually swamp you with weapons and armor choices to the point of saturation. BB has only 26 weapons however each one has two seperate ""modes"" so your short-ranged slash weapon at the press of a button can become a long-ranged thrust weapon. Each weapon feels noticeably different both between modes and between one another. Armor, or ""Attire"" as they call it is just that, mostly the differences are only skin deep. Some have higher resistances to adverse effects but there isn't really any ""best armor"" in the game just like there isn't really a ""best weapon"" it all comes down to your play-style and what you are good at. It is a risky move to mess with genre conventions like this but it massively pays off. It makes the game feel unique, even among its brethren of souls games. The difficulty is a slightly odd one for me, in the scope of Souls games only of course. Compare this game to anything other than a Souls game and yes, it is very difficult however amongst Souls games I really don't find this to be too hard. My first play through took me 40 hours and no boss ever had me stuck for much more than maybe 5 attempts. Compare this to DS2 DLC bosses that wrecked me maybe 40 times before I finally got by and you can see my point. For what it's worth I feel like I am ""better"" at BB than Souls, due to the aggressive play style and the fact I find parries easier and MUCH more powerful in BB than Souls. It is still vastly satisfying to progress through but I'm not sure it was as satisfying as some of the Souls series. Either way that is a minor, personal quibble and really that is the only flaw I can raise about the game. It is great in basically all facets you can judge a game by. The only reason it isn't a 10 for me is I've reserved that score for games I consider to be ""greatest of all time"" contenders and there is no shame of falling short of that. BB is one of the best games I've ever played and it is certainly amongst the best of this generation of consoles. It deserves to be played by way more people than it's already vast audience, I think the difficulty scares some people off but they don't know what they're missing. Once you break through that wall and ""git gud"" it is probably one of the best experiences you can have with a video game.",9,2018-03-25,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Der einzige negative Punkt meiner Meinung nach sind die Dungeons.

morrise,"Tried this game cuz was free on PS+, it started quite interesting, dark Gothic atmosphere and fun combat gameplay , but after some hours playing it became tedious, the logic of the game revolves around grinding over and over through the same environment and enemies to get prepared for boss battles, Fortunately a souls-borne experienced friend of mine helped me to get through the bosses. The story.. well not much to tell, just average, the biggest disappointing is how little content has to offer, if you're good you can speed-run it in one hour, that's ridiculous for a supposedly AAA game. Graphically is not impressive at all, the different areas of the game look almost the same except maybe the forbidden forest, what started as a dark and provocative atmosphere turned into a sequence of boring aisles ,stairways and town squares, in addition this constant stuttering or flickering, don't know how to explain it, it's really a headache. Best department would be the music it's amazing but it does not compensate the other flaws specially the lack of content, in summary this game is highly overrated to the point of being called a ""master piece"", what i really found was an average game with little content, great music and fun combat mechanic if you don't mind the grinding.",5,2018-03-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user

For those who haven't experienced Bloodborne and want to give it a try, but are intimidated by the negativity of those who couldn't handle the difficulty level, do yourself a favor and make up your own mind. Because no matter how many times I failed, Bloodborne always pulled me back for more. And I never regretted seeing it through to the end.",10,2018-03-12,PLAYSTATION 4,user
cemyildirim33,"Don't be fooled by the positive reviews. This game is not for the majority of the gamers. Read this review keeping in mind that I'm absolutely neutral. Never played any Souls games before, and never tried Bloodborne until it went free on PS plus. I still can not recommend it although not having payed for it. I can say that the game is not difficult at all, it's just unnecessarily missing so many things that would make it loved by more people aside from the ''veterans''. - There is no save option. No matter how much you progress, when you die you'll start from the last ''Lantern'' you activated, which are extremely rare to find (I played for 10 hours and only found one) - When you die, you don't only start from the BEGINNING of that level, EVERY ENEMY you have slayed until that point will be respawned. ALL OF THEM. Making the game unnecessarily dragging. You will lose ALL your money, which are required even in order to level up. (You use the currency in order to increase your stats, which level you up) -There is no map, and the environment can be confusing because it's not a small area and you need to find some shortcuts because there are no saving in this game. Which is a pain because every area there are a TON of enemies. When you try to escape them, the other comes and they suddenly surround you. - If you say ''no problem, I like me a good challenge'' after reading the things I mentioned above, keep in mind that there is no incentive to keep playing the game. There is no story. You just wake up in a hospital-like building. And if you talk to some NPCs outside, you can learn that it's the night of the hunt (whatever the hell that means). That's all. I mean why would I waste my time playing this and starting all over and killing the same enemies again? + The only thing I liked about this game is the atmosphere. It's dark, it's gloomy, it's serious. Which suits my tastes. But too bad the other things ruin this game. Conclusion: If you still are not convinced after reading this, by all means go and try the game. But try it now while it's free with PS plus. Because the chances are you will not be one of those minority of people who likes this game. Do NOT pay for it even if it's on sale.

Everyone, the Demons Souls and Dark Souls, has a hat on their heads. I love the art design, combat system, world structure & Co and I like the principle of random dungeons as well as the multiplayer components for up to three people. In the latter, nasty traps are added. The heaviness is easier than in Demons Souls, but the new comfort and multiple healing potions, but the adventure after the game is not so bad. Look forward to characters with several consecutive tasks and tragic consequences. The load times, collision and frame rate issues are natural, but in any case the gap with the number of confusing features and functions with spectacular jobs.

At first I felt a bit frustrated, because I did not know where to go, what to do and I was a bit annoyed by the fact that you lose all your echoes everytime you die (although you can retrieve them if you don't die again before) so this is the reason why I recommend, for the new players, to watch a tutorial on Youtube, it helps a lot. Once you understand better the mechanics of the game, how the storytelling works and how to cope withe the difficulty of the game, is really enjoyable. You will still die many times if this is your first playthrough, no doubt about that, but it does not feel too repetitive, since the playability is quite fluent and fun and, once you learn the movements of each NPC, quite straightforward. I am positively surprised by this game, still dying a lot though. A first i looks like a very unfair game and, for me, the boss battles are very tough, but for now I did not need to repeat them more than 4 times. The atmosphere is obviously Gothic and spooky which reminds me a lot to Sleepy Hollow, and I love that (although some NPCS can give you a bit of a scare when they appear out of nowhere). It has its issues, not too important from my point of view, within the technical side of the software, e. g. : dead NPCS swirl and move like jelly when you walk over them, it's kinda funny, but odd. In conclusion, I really recommend this game, although I understand if you are the type of player that gets frustrated very easy and do no enjoy difficulty, as good as this game is, it is not for you.",9,2018-02-03,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Kokoroket87,"A combat focussed RPG from the creators of Dark Souls, Bloodborne’s gameplay will be recognisable to those familiar with the franchise with a few noticeable tweaks. Set in the Victorian London Era inspired town of Yharnam, you play as a Hunter whom must endure the “Night of the Hunt”; an annual event where beasts and other monstrosities whom roam the streets are hunted down. Much like the Souls series, progress is difficult, and you will die often as you engage your enemies, but it is rarely unfair. Despite this it will be frustrating for some and rewarding for others. Successful combat is about recognising attack patterns and learning when’s best to strike or retreat. Each fight should be given great attention at first, even against the weakest enemies. Unlike Dark Souls, there are no shields in Bloodborne, resulting in brisker combat not dissimilar to a twin-stick shooter. In its place you have a firearm as support for your primary melee weapon. However, these are best used as a trump card to stun enemies. Defeating enemies will give you Blood Echoes, essentially the in-game currency that you need to level up. Boss battles can range from challenging to brutalising depending on your level as your progression isn’t entirely fixed – you can encounter certain bosses in different orders and not all are necessary to defeat to advance in the game. Level Design is labyrinthine, like a Metroidvanias stitched together via gauntlets of enemies. In other words, defeating a string of enemies may lead to discovering a shortcut allowing you the choice to bypass a section completely provided you endured and survived its challenges. This ensures the world feels like a connected environment rather than a series of levels. There are many secret passages in the game also that are difficult to find. The game takes pride in obscuring these solutions and your success in unveiling them will largely depend on your interest in the games lore and your commitment to decoding these mysteries. The narrative is told largely through NPC’s, the environmental design and some unsigned notes – some are direct, but most are cryptic. The rare cut scenes are intentionally vague and make the atmosphere mysterious and oppressive. In other words, don’t expect to sit back and be told what’s happening - the game wants you to earn that too. Even if the minor details are hard to follow, the overarching narrative is fairly clear by games end but greater curiosity in the worlds machinations will likely lead to further playthroughs given there are dialogue trees with certain characters that can exact different outcomes; denizens can assist you or hold you back depending how you interact with them. Aesthetically, Bloodborne is Gothic Horror; a Victorian setting of cluttered ornate architecture permanently clouded in dark hues, designs both graceful and jagged towering over you, creating awe and discomfort. A deliberate chroma-aberration filter along the frames edges is nauseating at first but can be accustomed to over time and ultimately gives the world an ethereal quality. Enemy design takes inspiration from HP Lovecraft horror fables; hideous designs equal parts fascinating as they are disturbing. They are the chief attraction of the game and you will likely find a least favourite (most effective at killing you) by games end. However, they are not the only enemy. Hunters roam the streets too – some are restrained but more often they’ll target you too. These fights are truly chaotic and require constant movement with little reprieve. They possess similar weapons to you and should be treated as Mini-Bosses. I should add hit detection is better optimised here too compared to Dark Souls, with consistent hit boxes and tracking enemies, although present isn’t as unforgiving too. These are big improvements, resulting in less frustration in death. I recommend this game highly on an objective level, especially if you like a challenge, Gothic horror and environmental storytelling. However, it requires a lot of time commitment to master, both in gameplay sessions and the regularity in which you play, so keep that in mind.",9,2018-02-02,PLAYSTATION 4,user

teemz22,"You will be addicted to this game trust me..... ONLY if you can ""break the wall"" so to speak. You have to get to the point where all the things in bloodborne just click into place for you. It took me quite some time, I was really close to giving up, but once you level up a few times, upgrade your weapons and just get better at the game, oh man, it's addictive. this game to me is more addicting than witcher 3, that's saying a lot. I can't stop playing it (level 54 now). all I can say, be patient with it, be really patient, if you are a casual and just want to pass time then bloodborne is not for you. + Atmosphere and graphics gameplay in general sound effects and voice acting (it's so good!!!!) the most important is the feeling of achievement and satisfaction which you don't get too often with games these days. - random glitches and some cheap deaths sometimes you get randomly stuck in textures F****ing FRAME RATE!!! this games begs to be in 60 fps, the frame rate drops can be quite severe and you will DIE because of them, A LOT, and people who say their games runs smoothly and they don't see any drops are obviously blind or in denial",8,2018-01-25,PLAYSTATION 4,user

phoeniix23,"I bought my PS4 in September 2015 along with physical copies of Destiny, Witcher 3, Last of Us and...Bloodborne. I enjoyed and completed all the first three games but when I got to Bloodborne, I traded it in at Gamestop after 5hrs of dying over and over and over again. I didn't get the rave reviews and fan service Bloodborne received. I hated it and couldn't understand how FromSoft could get away with such a crazy hard game with horrible design. That was in 2015. Fast forward to 2018, and after chipping away at my backlog of games (Horizon, Mass Effect Andromeda, Mafia III, Mad Max, auncharted 4, Titanfall 2, Battlefield 1, Dragon Age, FFXV, Deus Ex, Fallout 4, Tomb Raider, Hellblade, MGSV, Infamous, Yakuza, Doom) over the past 2 years, I find myself looking for a challenge. I came to realize, after completing all those games and enjoying their stories/worlds/characters, that all those games had one thing in common. They felt easy, like I'm not engaged. I enjoy a good story sure, but I always find myself looking to finish up the story quickly so I can move on to the next game backlog. I didn't feel these games respected my capabilities as a gamer, as the person controlling that joystick and buttons. So then I bought Bloodborne during a PSN sale. $17 for the complete edition. This time, I said to myself, I cannot trade it in since it was digital. I'll give it a proper go for a good 2 weeks max, and if I still hated it, then no more FromSoft games for me. I don't know what it was. Maybe my skills as a PS4 gamer improved over the past 2 years, or maybe I've been playing too many easy games that I actually enjoyed being challenged and dying with proper consequences (losing 5000 blood echoes to those damn crawling corpses), but I started to enjoy Bloodborne. I still ****, at first. Then I got the hang of the controls, of the momentum of my attacks/parries/rolls, the enemy movements. I kinda MELDED with my Dualshock and foe the first time, I felt myself shaking and blood pumping as I brought down the Cleric Beast on my first try!! In 2015, I died like a gazillion times to that ****. I saw the words ""PREY SLAUGHTERED"" on the screen and that's when it totally clicked for me and I plunged deep into the world of Yharnam. And I tell you, it's dark and beautiful. Mesmerizing. Every new section I entered brought a sense of foreboding adventure, of trepidation mixed with determined desire to overcome any challenge. Every boss I defeated brought a new sense of euphoria. And when I let success get to my head, Bloodborne made me crash hard back to earth. Lose the Fear, be overconfident, and you die in Bloodborne. Be a hunter, be alert and sharp, be at one with THE KIRKHAMMER, and I vanquished my enemies with glee. The perceived lack of story was totally refreshing as I wasn't spoonfed with exposition/cutscenes/poor dialogue. I had to pay attention to item/weapon descriptions, the looks of enemies and their behavior, world changes, environment design, bosses, etc. The world IS the story. And I loved it!! I dove into guides to learn more about the lore, and I discovered a thriving and dedicated community. I'm currently at Rom the Vacuous Spider, but I don't want to proceed as I want to enjoy this superb world as long as possible, focusing on optional bosses/sections and the Old Hunters DLC first. The beautiful thing about Bloodborne is even if you levelled up your character to what you might think is a high level, it can still kill you if you're careless or overconfident. This is the first game that made me DREAM about its world. I'm constantly thinking about strategies of how to overcome a certain section/enemy that it bleeds into my sleeping nights. Amazing, amazing game by FromSoft. I am crazy excited about Dark Souls Remastered, May 25, 2018. TLDR; if you are tired of easy games and want a proper challenge, play Bloodborne and embrace your hunter blood.",10,2018-01-20,PLAYSTATION 4,user

RealMuthaF,"Since I've lost the original fairly extensive text for some reason, I'll keep it brief this time. Before Bloodborne I played only Demon's Souls and I thought it was garbage. Bloodborne came out like 7 years later and it still stucks in the same departments - bad early PS3-era graphics (Not improved since Demon's Souls!), zero plot whatsoever, boring combat system (hit with one button and roll with another), and artificially inflated difficulty (Enemies have much health and damage, you don't. That's the whole ""challenge"".). I sincerely don't get when other annual franchises like Call of Duty and Assassin's Creed get (rightfully) criticized for being the same game over and over again, whereas this mucus gets a pass.",1,2018-01-20,PLAYSTATION 4,user
IanOD1,"I'm a little behind on the times with this one, but I LOVE this game, it's definitely my favorite RPG on PS4!! The detail in the architecture and characters is awesome, especially the monsters. The difficulty is very high, which I love, seems most games produced nowadays are way too easy. I feel like they're aiming at the dull, brainless masses, who follow celebrities like a religion. But if you want to make big money, that's the best way to do it, so I can't blame them. This game on the other hand, is very hard, not hard enough to make you give up, but right on the cusp. I'm almost done with the main game and, there're still enemies from earlier levels who can kill me fairly quickly, if I'm not careful. I can only hope they make another one, though it doesn't look like they will. I bought the complete digital version as well as the physical copy and digital DLC, just to add to the demand and hopefully convince From Software to make a new one. This is the only game I ever liked enough to buy the art book. I got the Japanese version, which is twice as big as the American version. The only complaint I have, is multiplayer can be a bit of a pain in the arse to use. When you ring the Beckoning Bell to ask for help, it uses Insight and, then as soon as you beat the boss from that area, the person is kicked from the game. Sometimes it takes a while for them to join as well. I like how they also add the possibility of adversaries joining to try n kill you and your partner. Overall I LOVE the game and the multiplayer issue is so minor I feel bad even mentioning it. Perfect 10 for me!",10,2018-01-10,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Ulfhednir,"First of all I have to say I'm a huge fan of the Souls Franchise. My expectations to this game were extremely high. I avoided consoles my whole life as a PC-Gamer. Long story, but in the end i bought a PS4 just for this game and it was definetily worth all the money. This game looks good from the technical point of view. But the mystic cursed dark world this game offers is so much more. It's just a Masterpiece in the history of videogames. The fresh setting of the victorian London plus cursed Darkness creates the same deep Atmosphere like the other Souls-Games. Sound fits to the dark mood in this game. The Movement System is a bit faster than in Souls but also rewarding. Next Highlight, like in all Souls-Games, are the bossfights. The Design of the Bosses is so wonderful and the mechanics are really diversified. The Playtime, especially with the really good DLC is, I would think around 50 hours for a first playthrough. The Game maybe is a bit frustrating to new players. You should have in mind that it's a part of the gamedesign that you will die. And you will often. To understand this helps a lot to perceive the uniqueness of the Soulsborne Games nowadays. They are different than most of the modern games. Also the storytelling is a point spoonfedded Blockbuster players will find ununsual or bad. Nearly all of the really deep and forked story is told just by descriptions of items you find and so there's much space for interpretation. Thousands of players are discussing the lore in forums, so you see it's not trivial or rudimentated. I know I compare this game very much to Dark or Demon's Souls, but it had to fulfill high expectations because of these highly rewarded games. I'm struggling to describe this unique Gametype to a person who didn't play a Souls-Game before. Get a PS4 and play this **** piece of misanthropic art and make your own opinion like I did. Enjoy your (maybe first) Souls-Experience. After that things won't be like they were before. Miyazaki (the gamedirector) changed my (gamer-)life with his games.",10,2017-12-15,PLAYSTATION 4,user

GRAPHICS +10/10 GAMEPLAY +10/10 ENTERTAINMENT +10/10 VALUE FOR MONEY 0/10 (only because I **** s*#t at playing it) Even though I was terrible at playing it I would thoroughly recommend it- unless you’re the type who can’t control their anger- when you die that’s it man, you start from the beginning- no save points- something which personally I wish they had included under a, “I give up” difficultly level.",8,2017-12-11,PLAYSTATION 4,user
stamito,"This is a fantastic game in a lot of ways. You can see it has been made by the same people that makes dark souls, meaning that the game will somehow feel familiar if you’ve played dark souls, but it is a very different game. We’re looking at one of the best ARPG in my opinion, excels in every level. First of all, general graphic quality is all right, you won’t see any superb textures and stuff like that here, but they are good. Anyway, that doesn’t really matter since the artistic side of the graphics is so superb, it doesn’t really matter. Artistically speaking, it is one of the most immersive, unique, mysterious settings I’ve ever seen. It has a gothic/horror feeling to it, which goes very well with the game and universe is set into. The enemies and other npc deserve special mention here, their design again is fantastic, with a lot of grotesque monsters around. Sound and music are also fantastic, it goes fantastically well with the game, amazing music and sound effects in general. To the gameplay then, for those who have played dark souls (DS) before, I think it’s fair to say that it feels a lot like it but much faster paced and aggressive. DS in my opinion is about waiting for the right moment. If you haven’t played dark souls, I’d say bloodborne feels a bit like for example darksiders, or god of war but variety of combos are substituted by weapons. Also BB is a lot more demanding, you’ll die much more easily, you need to have a plan and be careful, which is a main difference with those examples I mentioned. However, in terms of speed and how aggressive you should be, it is similar to those games. I feel the game has done a great job at making different weapons feel different (e.g. fast but low damage weapon, vs slow and bulky but very damaging weapons, differences in range etc.) and depending on your weapon you’ll want to equip different clothes and skills and increase different attributes. So it has a system, that without being very deep, it is deep enough for you to have different play styles. Comapred to DS, DS has a much higher RPG component that this one. So although BB is a ARPG, it is much more action than RPG in my opinion. Finally, my main criticism and the reason I don’t give this a 10, comes from the difficulty. For me bloodborne presents the right level of challenge, it is hard enough to make me give my 100%, but not hard enough to make me grind or repeat something a 1000 times. Most I’ve died against a boss was 3 times or something like that (with the exception of the DLC final boss, which was more in the range or 10-15). However, this level of difficulty is just too much for a lot of people. I do understand that high difficulty is part of the design of the gameplay here, so I think just making an easy mode would actually kill the experience. However, I do believe that there are ways to make a game easier, without having to make the game easier in itself. For example, just by adding the possibility of summoning allied npc’s in every boss (which you can’t do for a lot of them). Also, another thing that’s badly done and it’s going to sound contradictory is that the game gets far too easy towards the end; this is at least in the game of the year edition. I haven’t farmed at all in this game, and I haven’t died a lot (for a DS/BB kind of thing) and I’ve only lost my blood echoes (experience) once or twice. Having said that, the last few bosses (5/6 bosses) were very very easy because I was too strong. This, to a lower extent also happened to me in DS2, so it sounds to me like something they need to work on. This game getting to easy partially ruins the fun, I think they need to work on making sure the game stays demanding throughout the whole thing. I remember FF VIII did that for example, adjusting the level of enemies based on yours. Also think the story could be told in a bit of a more straightforward way, rather than so fragmented. I get the fragmented thing has a point and it builds on a mysterious aura, but sometimes the way you get the info is far too random (e.g. having to look at a specific painting in a castle mid game and having to link that painting with an item description 15 hours later to get some global view on an event is just too random in my opinion). For those struggling to make sense of the story after playing the game, I do recommend reading “the paleblood hunt”. It is a fan written book that throws light and links a lot of gaps you might not be able to link otherwise. I insist I would read it AFTER finishing the game, to avoid spoilers. Anyway summarising, this a superb game in all aspects, gameplay, art, lore. If you like ARPG (that are stronger on the action side of things), you’ll love bloodborne. However, this is a demanding and challenging game, if you don’t consider yourself good at games or ready to face a decent challenge , I wouldn’t go for it. You probably won’t enjoy it and just get frustrated.",9,2017-12-04,PLAYSTATION 4,user

MaxPayneIsGod,"FromSoft delivers again with their spin on a more aggressive and attacking oriented Souls game. Aesthetically BB is immaculate, from the environments down to the enemy design, everything has been created with a type of demented care which sets the scene perfectly. Sound design is beautiful, the music and the ambient sounds are sculpted around and into the experience. And yes those are babies crying. The story is as bizarre as it gets, however delving deeper is recommended, read and listen to everything. Bit by bit your piece together something quite unique. Overall the game is flawless and I can't recommend it enough. However, the Chalice Dungeons. I hate ""Challenge Rooms"" in games, I don't care what you say about the lore and the extra enemies and bosses. The Chalice Dungeons are monotonous, repetitive extremely unnecessary. By the time I managed to grind my way to the trophy for Queen Yharnam I was so OP the last section of the main game was trivial at best. From could've and should've made the dungeons another ""level"" within the main game. I for one will never touch them again.

gq_foine,"So a little history about my experience before I get into the review. I played this back in 2015 and couldn't get very far after a few hours and gave up... I didn't get why people loved this game besides the absolutely gorgeous scenery and graphics - best of what a PS4 can offer. Music and sound effects were amazing.. But no real story, unless you look for it and try to flesh it out. The gameplay just brutally tough and I couldn't get pass the first boss and so I quit..... BUT THEN- a couple of years later went by (2017) and I said you know what let me give this another try after playing Dark Souls 1 on PS3. I put the disc in nervous won't get very far again but I said you know what Dark Souls was tough but this one has no shield and I want a faster game pace. A few hours later I couldn't put it down. I finally got the rhythm and timing. And understood the battle mechanics. You do have to do a lot of grinding and didn't realize you have to level up a lot in order to be able to play through the bosses, and regular fights. But if you can get the rhythm and timing right this game isn't that tough. Yes, you will die a lot still because some monster lurking in some corner that you were unaware or expect. But that is the thrill of the game. This game is not for someone who gives up easily that is for sure. This game doesn't have much of story but what it does have is pure raw satisfaction when you defeat a boss after 100 tries and finally clear it. It punishes the weak gamers and folks who aren't able to adapt to the gameplay or battle mechanics. Now pushing over 45hrs this game is absolutely a masterpiece! I absolutely love this game because its tough, challenging, and makes you want to get better gamer. It can be super difficult but don't youtube how to defeat a boss. LEARN, ADAPT, AND HAVE FUN because this game surely does that. It makes me a smarter, better, and more intelligent gamer! It has some minor frame rate issues and hoping that the PS4 Pro won't have these problems. So here is how I broke it down in these categories: Graphics - 10 - the best of this generation - scary like Resident Evil, but reminds me of Castlevania Sound - 10 - Music is amazing with the sound effects the best I have heard. It's freaken scary! Game play - 9- but camera can be dysfunctional and wished the camera viewing should be fixed when battling. Story - 7 - very little and wished they would have explored the story more since it looks very interesting.. They should have developed the story to really enhance the RPG experience since the little of the story of the information they do provide is really good! Rating Overall - 9.5 - some minor bugs, virtually little to no story, and during a battle the camera can get in the way, But what it does have is absolutely amazing boss fights, great graphics, best gameplay, best sound effects and great music! in summary, I would absolutely recommend this game to people who are looking for a tough challenge. It has amazing battle mechanics, crazy BOSS fights, absolutely beautiful graphics and glorious satisfaction on conquering the game. I have much still to learn but I can't stop thinking about how to beat a particular boss or city. Be patient on fighting this is not a Hack and Slash. I am looking forward to Bloodborne 2- let the hunt begin! DLC - cost $20- it comes with one large new areas to explore with 5 new bosses. I am not believer in these DLC things since its just a money grab, but I supported the developer on this because I wanted to support the IP. They don't have Micro transactions BS like EA, 2K, Activision, Take Two.. UPDATE: I finally got the Platinum Trophy- The 4th Chalice dungeon (Defiled) was the most difficult! And now just cleared the DLC - 100%! Wow that was definitely difficult but rewarding!",10,2017-11-27,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Aginagala,"Bloodborne is a merciless, grotesque, unforgiving world full of devilish monsters that give you no heed, and I absolutely love it. You begin the game feeling underwhelmed, under powered and with an impossible task of clearing the game while following the impossibly complex and vague story, yet still interested in what you'll find next. Only to find yourself dying over... and over... and over. An almost replica of previous souls titles however Bloodborne feels more fast paced... you aren't given a shield and the only defense you have are your quick wits and strategic mind. Not recommended for beginners to the controls of using a console controller however great for developing getting used to where the buttons are. A stunning environment with impressive visuals Bloodborne is truly a special addition to the gaming community. This barbaric RPG will take punish you for getting even slightly relaxed as it's grueling experience is never ending and will most certainly keep you on your toes the entire way. A satisfying ending and extremely good replayability, Bloodborne is a must have game for any PS4 player, horror fan or someone who simply wants a challenge. A masterpiece of game development.",8,2017-11-13,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Combat was intense, atmosphere/environment dark and menacing. The whole weapon system and shop features could have been better. More difference between gear would have been appreciated. Towards the end I just wanted to get over the line but this is not to say that I haven't enjoyed the journey and on many occasions i was drawn back to it. Always a good sign.

670Gamer,"October 2017 Okay, unfortunately, after a year and nine months after first playing the game and not ever wanting to touch it again because it was so damn hard, I decided to give it another try. For some reason, a week ago, I felt that I should give Bloodborne another try and the challenge might slowly appeal to me and I can also use it to kill time. WOAH was I right, I don't know why I didn't give it another shot a year ago but now I am loving it and now understand why it is up there with the The Witcher, which is still my favorite RPG for the PS4. My initial rating was a 4, but I'm bumping that up to an 8. Why not 9 and 10? Well, I just find it annoying to continuously kill the same enemies over and over. I mean the game is hard enough and I am also learning that the ""map"" is huge (good thing). January 15, 2016. What I'm I missing here? I know people are saying you have to be patient and learn from your enemies, environment blah blah, but isn't that time consuming/boring? I mean killing those freaks is so tempting and I do want to use my badass weapons right? I really want to like this game because it was a Christmas gift, but during the 1st 2 hours of playing and having to kill the same bad guys over again after dying or progress to a certain part then die then have to replay the whole thing again from the same checkpoint which i passed 30 minutes ago.....that was very frustrating for me and had to change up and continue playing MG:PP, which of course calmed my nerves and made me feel happy again. Gosh, how about if I had to go somewhere right away and had to end my game? Let me guess, ""too bad start at the same checkpoint"". Anyone who rated this game 7 or higher felt this?? Great advice to help me continue the game is much appreciated. Thank you!",8,2017-10-05,PLAYSTATION 4,user

NoMoreShilling,"I've played every FROMSOFT Souls Game, from Demon Souls to Dark Souls 3, on all of them I have atleast 100h of Gameplay on each. Bloodborne is NOT a classical Souls-Game, the Gameplay is fundamentally different, it has the same approach of difficult enemies but the core mechanism how the game works and flows is different. Bloodborne is way more fast paced, armor doesn't matter that much, and you get rewarded for playing aggressive. I think the mindset that Bloodborne is the same as Dark Souls made it bad for many Dark Souls players. Let's come to one of the most important things that gets overshadowed most of the time in the current age. Art-Style. Bloodbornes art style is unbelievable amazing, all those details, when you enter Yharnem for the first time you can feel the Victorian influence. The armors look beautifull, the weapons make sense and the overall world feels creepy but on the same time mysterious. They used the perfect colors to give you that mysterious horror vibe. Later in the Game you can see that the Lovecraft books influenced Bloodborne. Gameplay wise it feels perfect, fluid gameplay with more than enough weapon choices. Dark Souls games tend to offer copypasta weapons with different names, while in Bloodborne every weapon is truly unique. When you find a new weapon you find a new way to play the game. Why 9/10? The Bloodgem farming is way to tedious, the chalice dungeons are a good idea but not executed well. (like most random generated stuff) Also the frametimes and framerate are a huge issues. The loading times got fixed fast and the framedips are no longer sub 20 but in the 30-28FPS area but the frametimes are terrible. But can you give FROMSOFT the fault for this?",9,2017-09-17,PLAYSTATION 4,user

whitewulf789,"If you're a fan of Lovecraft and Dark Souls, This is the game for you. I shall warn you, the game doesn't pull punches. For someone who played Dark Souls the first time using a shield constantly, it was a bit difficult to kick the habit, but once I kicked it, it sure felt good. The lack of a shield in this game is what makes the combat superior than Dark Souls, There is a shield but it's terrible. I also see there are many bad reviews from this game and I feel as if a lot of people couldn't get passed the first mandatory boss, Father Gascoigne. He's no pushover. Once I finally passed him after the 100th time the rest of the game went pretty smoothly. The fact that the weapons can switch into new weapons is awesome, especially since they can be integrated into combos. I do not wish to speak much about the game since I don't want to spoil things for people but I have one thing to say about the first mandatory boss, Don't Give Up!

Term,"-- Updated Review (From May 2015, Published in 2017) -- After playing this game beyond where I left off and following the ""git gud scrub"" guide, it's actually a 9. I know, I'm a moron for rating it so low to begin with, and I didn't give it the proper chance that it deserved because it's actually one of the best games that I've played, especially when you pay attention to the fine detail FROM included. I was not reading the item descriptions or deciphering the cryptic messages provided by NPCs, and there's actually a very deep story to be told here. I expected the game to spoon feed me details about the story, and have now come to appreciate the method that its done. The same goes for the gameplay, which is spectacular and detail oriented. The game is brutal, but extremely fair. I let that get to me during my original review. If you're greedy when fighting, it will punish you. In most RPGs, your stats progress you forward to success in combat; however in Bloodborne this is not the case. While your stats still matter and you can stack up ridiculous numbers with them, not following the correct mechanics of the game and hacking away at NPC's with no care will get you killed. Get ready to start over again - THAT is what put me off. But when you fully understand the mechanics, you'll start punishing the game itself for its poor moves against your quick dodging and smarter move set. They've released updates since my first review. These include improved load times, a better camera, a better frame rate and a completely new DLC for extra content. And on New Game Plus (I did beat the game in its entirety), the DLC is even more brutal. And I love it. This game is still not for everyone. It's a testament to a society that has a short attention span and a want (or need) for instant gratification - which the game will not provide. However, the gratification you'll get from pulling yourself back up after you've tried a solid 10 times and eventually overcoming an obstacle that seemed almost impossible is the most rewarding you'll find from any game. That was me when I left my original review, consider me converted to a higher expectation of difficulty and gaming experience. If you're looking for a real challenge - one that's fair to both you and the game, look no further than Bloodborne. It's a serious work of art. -- Original Review from April 2015 -- I really wanted to like this game. I really, truly did. The rave reviews are great. What it comes down to is this: - Bland, repetitive gameplay. - No storyline. There is literally nothing here. What am I killing? What happened in this bland town? What is the hunters dream? What am I hunting? Guess I'll never know. - The lamest attempt of difficulty. It's not a hard game, however it reeks of synthetic difficulty. It's not puzzling, it's not hard, but the amount of mobs, clunky controls and nauseous camera make it feel that way. - In-game camera from hell. - Clunky, uninspired controls that seem to have been implemented just to frustrate the player. - Extreme loading times. Considering the fact the developers added in all of this synthetic difficulty, it would be easy to assume they realized the amount of ""loading"" that would have to be done. Why didn't they cache the games resources in memory? Is this just another synthetic ploy to give the player a feeling of difficulty? Who know, but I'm sure the PS4 has more than enough to accommodate... Really just an uninspired, repetitive, slow/clunky hack and slash that has a cult following. It's a complete disappointment in my book, and I don't recommend anyone waste their time completing this game. Not as if there is any satisfaction of doing so, there's no story to be told. Perhaps if this game had an actual story. Or maybe challenge that isn't from the frustration of controls or number of mobs. Or maybe if this game just had feeling to it that didn't seem rushed and completely fake. Maybe then it would be great to anybody but soul fans. But, this one goes back to the store, and for the first time in a long time, I actually feel really good about doing that. A real disappointment for a console that had a lot of promise, but no games to go with it. Thanks Sony, really enjoying the PS4 so far. Hah.",9,2017-07-18,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Rgc,"This game is just great. Its gameplay is 10, I was very attracted that the combat is faster and intense compared to the saga dark souls. But without a doubt the best thing about this game is its artistic design that captivates you with its dark look and suspense. The soundtrack is amazing especially in the first boss where you put the hair of tip and the battle becomes more epic. The graphics are fine. The biggest mistake I can find the video game is the fall of fps in some areas (especially in the area where there are many fires lit). Also what annoys me more is not the game but the community that presumes that it is exclusive of the playstation 4 when they do not even buy it and they are not interested. In conclusion if you like a lot of games that offer a challenge like the game of yesteryear and recently the saga dark souls this is your game.",10,2017-07-04,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Scoutulambo,"Retrospective after two years: This game has a couple problems. It runs at 30 fps, which can be a problem for some people, and in specific areas there is noticeable frame drops, especially in Lecture Hall Floor 1. There are fifteen or so second load screens every time the character warps to a new location and you can't warp directly between lanterns like you can in some of the Souls games. The game has a high initial learning curve and when vials start getting low it can be a lot of pressure on new players who don't know good locations to get vials or who don't know to use some echoes to bolster their stockpile. The non-root chalice dungeons are somewhat boring once you've been through them once. Co-op can be somewhat confusing your first couple times. All this said, the combat in this game is tight, the bosses are varied and interesting, it nails the oppressive atmosphere many survival horror games fail to create, the root-chalices ensure you're rewarded for putting effort into the game, much of the game's story is told through visuals, each area's design and atmosphere work well together, and the game is incredible at creating tension. It's the best 3D action-adventure game I've played and is not too far off Link to the Past in quality. If you're looking through reviews to figure out if the game will be too difficult for you, you shouldn't worry too much. The game is pretty easy once you've gotten the hang of it (aside from some chalice dungeons) and the creators of the game intend for the player to struggle. The bosses are difficult so you feel better when you succeed. Play aggressive and learn the rhythm of the game's battles and you're in for a great time.",10,2017-07-03,PLAYSTATION 4,user
captainkane,"Bloodborne is an unimaginative, technical mess. From Software keeps rehashing the same ideas without fixing chronic problems that plague every Souls game. In this case, BB strips out all the great elements of Souls while leaving all the performance issues and bugs in place. It’s everything bad about the series crammed into one package. BB is not optimized. It performs poorly and looks merely average. Muddled textures, poor animations, and abysmal frame rates are just some of the problems. Adjusting the camera generates nausea inducing blur. The targeting feature is as glitchy and frustrating as ever. BB is the only game that’s crashed on my new PS4 Pro. From is nearly incapable of developing well optimized games. BB might have been passable on the PS3, but not on a powerhouse like the PS4. Frames are capped at 30fps and constantly drop into the teens. There are plenty of nextgen games that look slicker and run smoother. Lengthy load times degrade the experience further. BB reloads the entire game world after each death. According to From, this “reset” is necessary to completely flush system memory. Unfortunately, players will die a lot, so lengthy load screens are a major annoyance. Players endure two loads screens just to manage inventory. Players must transport to a specific location, enter a house, and access a chest to grab stored items. Then they have to transport back out all the while enduring loading screens each time they transport. Instead of simply accessing items, players are forced to waste minutes performing mundane tasks. This same process must be repeated to level up, buy items, and upgrade weapons. This probably explains BB’s terrible performance. Most assets are front loaded instead of being rendered as players traverse the world. So the engine renders unneeded assets at once creating a massive workload. There’s speculation From chose this route because BB couldn’t be optimized in time for launch, so it took the least time consuming approach. It ended up being inefficient and annoying. Combat is horrid. Players can’t block, so they must dodge and parry. But environments are either narrow littered alleys, or moderately-sized littered arenas. They don’t mesh with BB’s mechanics. Dodging is ineffective if players are banging against walls or tripping over debris. The janky targeting system further hinders combat because the camera cannot pass thru objects. It positions itself behind walls, barrels, and up enemies’ butts (no joke). Some bosses are maddeningly difficult unless players master parrying. It’s a high risk, high reward move which requires precise timing and moveset memorization. It’s so difficult, many Souls players don’t master it which makes certain fights move difficult than they should be. Combat suffers from clipping, poor detection, and animation glitches. Enemies attack thru walls and other impassable obstructions. Enemies continually attack players even if they lie stunned on the ground. Low frames and janky hit boxes foil precise combat. BB is full of cheap shots. BB forces players to spend exorbitant amounts of time farming for basic necessities. Instead of replaying bosses to learn patterns, players must farm the items needed to master difficult battles. If a boss kicks someone’s tail again and again, they will have to farm again and again. All the best gear and “magic” items are buried in the last third of the game. Players will need to be level 80+ to get them. Some items require an insane amount of farming to procure. This baffling design decision hampers build variety. And most of the magic gear is useless and prohibitively expensive to use anyway. As usual, online play is underwhelming and geared towards Souls tryhards. Lag, low player population, and one-sided invasions afflict BB just like every Souls game. From pushes multiplayer hard despite the low demand for it. The co-op aspect of BB is the worst all of Souls games. Gameplay-wise, BB is a big leap back from the maligned Dark Souls 2. BB strips out story, magic, blocking, hybrid builds, and weapons diversity. To compensate, From throws in underpowered guns which are only useful in a few instances. Guns can be used to parry, but that’s so dang difficult many players don’t bother. Players are left with unsatisfactory character progression, uninteresting enemies, zero build variety, and a so-so story. Replay value is low comparatively. So I don’t understand why it’s loved so much when DS2 exceeds BB in every meaningful way. Bloodborne is derivative and unpolished. The only positive thing I can say: It works. The series is CODesque because From pushes the same product with only slight variations. Replacing shields with guns doesn’t make it a novel series. For PC gamers, I recommend Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin instead. From fixed annoyances in the original DS2 while boosting performance and visuals. Plus, 60fps!",4,2017-06-28,PLAYSTATION 4,user

BLK99,"Este juego no es un gran adelanto en la industria, tampoco es un reves, es solo una copia mas de los dark souls, que siempre son demasiados planos y aburrudos, con historias increiblemente complejas y misteriosas, que son dificiles de seguir y con el tiempo simplemente se pierde el interes, aunque lo de descubrirla uno mismo es interesante, pero que no sea por cinematicas. Las mecanicas del juego en lo que se refiere a combate y herramientas son rusticas y primitivas es como jugar un juego de hace 20 años, hay cero innovacion salvo en el hecho de que esquiva mas rapido, es la unica diferencia esa y los tiros que hay que pegar practicamente a cm del oponente por que despues de unos metros no sirve para nada. Su atmosfera no es mi estilo, entiendo que haya gente que prefiera el gotico y lo emo, y la historia super depresiva con su infinita sangre, sangre y mas sangre, pero los niveles que son plataformas exageradamente adornadas no concuerda con nada, me refiero a una ciudad un pueblo, esta es la plaza estas son las viviendas el sistema de desague, que ciudad tiene una escalera de 50 o 60 metros, hay cosas sin sentido por todos lados. No quiere esto decir que los diseños no tengan su puente fuerte el hecho de que todas las plataformas esten conectadas es una indea genial, pero la forma en que corta el acceso a esas areas si me parece deficiente una reja, un pequeño muro, y en este punto quiero hacer el comparendo con un assassin creed en donde todo se puede explorar todo, Ademas si es una reja lo que me impide el paso porque no la vuelo en mil pedazos (el dia que eso pase en un vidiojuego sera increible) o me pueda colar por una ventana o pueda abrir la puerta que se me de la gana, lo unico que hace falta es ser un poco mas creativo en esos segmentos, ejemplo porque carajos una puerta de madera en el hospital no la puedo partir a hachazos pero si pueda romper cajas por todo el pueblo o criptas en el cementerio. una cosa importante no se puede cancelar un kombo, si el movimiento del arma se ejecuta en un lapso de 2 segundos no se puede interumpir, asi que me tengo que comer el daño de un enemigo habiendo tenido la intencion de esquivar, obviamente se generan dos formas una dar jugar golpes cortos y esquive o golpes fuertes y largos distanciados, eso y aprenderse todos los patrones del enemigo, no se puede solo improvisar no tengo que saber todos los movimientos y saber donde me puedo ubicar, es aburrido si se juega asi, me vi un gameplay un speedrun y lo unico que se hizo en todo el juego fue en potenciar el ataque con dos items y coordinarse con el enemigo, ninguno duraba mas de unos minutos, y yo me pregunto es este un juego dificil, no, es un juego simple con unas daños por los enemigos desmesurados con un gameplay obsoleto, es como jugar tennis con los pies, claro que es dificil, pero no por eso es justo o equilibrado, y no por ser dificil es un buen juego, queria que de verdad me gustara este juego y lo he terminado como unas diez veces incluyendo el dlc, que mejoro un poco con las armas pero nada mas. Hay un detalle mas y es que un golpe de un enemigo te persigue hasta el ultimo segundo, son solo pocos instantes que se tiene para esquivar, es como si estuvieran programandos para girar en cualquier direccion, aunque sea fiscamente imposible, pero a quien le importa verdad? no hay forma de esquivarlo de manera lateral siempre es hacia atras, incluso los jefes parecen ser unos p... trompos o licuadoras que reparten a diestra.",5,2017-06-22,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Un apartado grafico muy bueno, y es que a pesar de ciertos bugs en los enemigos derrotados por ejemplo, fromsoftware a cuidado muchos detalles, aunque cabe mencionar que hay zonas en donde la play sufre mucho en el partado grafico, mas sin embargo es aceptable, un sonido increible, unas bestias abominables, y muy pero muy rejugable, de hecho la partida Nueva partida +, es muy buena, esta traducido al español laitno, y vale la pena.

WorldRedbull,"Bloodborne is one of the many reasons why you should even buy a PS4 in the first place, and is the best game(In my opinion) of the SoulsBorne series. 1. The gameplay is fast paced action, and plays extremely well. You don't have shields, which forces you to dodge, and I like that about Bloodborne. Instead, you get a gun, which is used to stunlock enemies to perform Visceral attacks. A lot of the weapons feel different from each other when used, which means there's tons of variety to to how you can attack enemies. Guns however, should only be used for Visceral attacking, except for the cannon, which you can use to do a ton of damage to an enemy. I'd say it's probably the best combat system FromSoft ever made. 2. The world. Yharnam is one of my favorite game locations. It is based on the London Victorian era style of buildings and such. Everything looks really detailed and actually makes you feel like you're in that era. The only real complaint would be that the character models aren't that great, but they do their job well. The areas look different from each other, and while it still has the generic FromSoft poisonous swamp area, the rest of the places the game takes you too feel different from anything the Souls games ever did. 3. Difficulty. This game is ACTUALLY difficult. A lot of your navigation requires a form of strategy, and some form of planning, since you do not have a shield and cannot hide behind it like a little wimp. Enemies are placed in areas they should really be in, and nothing ever feels too difficult, except for the next topic. Also the DLC is the most difficult thing you will ever play in your life, and I recommend you prepare for that ahead of time, before tackling it. 4. BOSSES. The bosses in this game for me, are genuinely some of the best I have ever fought against. However, there are two bosses, The Witch of Hemwick, and The Celestial Emissary, that feel weak, and should've probably been replaced with something else. Despite those two, the rest of the bosses give you a great challenge for wherever you are in the game. 5. SOUNDTRACK The soundtrack is great. That's really all I can say. Go and listen to it. Bloodborne is just one of those games that is so good, it'll keep you coming back. The variety of weapons can give you a different experience with the game, the bosses are ones you'd want to fight over and over again, because they give you such a great challenge, and you never get tired of playing it. You should definitely buy this but be warned: It is one of the most difficult games in the 2010s.",9,2017-05-26,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Knightmare725,"Its still puzzling and frustrating to me that I find this game so unenjoyable. I am a huge fan of From Software and have thoroughly enjoyed every game that they made. This is still, to this day, the only one that I cannot enjoy from the franchise. To explain what I mean, lets say the game world is your parents and you are the child: In Dark Souls your parents are strict but loving. They dont spoil you in which makes the rewards all the more exciting. You are comfortable in the fact that your parents love you, even though they arent easy on you. Whereas in Bloodborne you have a stepmother who is a sadistic maniac who takes pleasure in your discomfort and will always find ways to torment you, no matter how well avoid her. The only way to get reward is by enjoying your role of submission to her twisted game. (I know this isnt a perfect analogy, but i hope it helps you understand my point of view). The game to me, wasnt difficult but too often made me have a ""I really wish I werent here right now"" type of feeling every time I progressed in an area rather than a common feeling that I got in dark souls 1, 2 and 3, and that feeling being ""I wonder what this place has to offer and not just pain and frustration"".",0,2017-05-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user
luckydutch,"Lots of reviewers have covered the awesome tone and gameplay of Bloodborne and they’re all right (it is baddass) but as someone who was initially put-off by the supposed difficulty of the Souls games, I wanted to make a point of reviewing it and saying: DON’T MAKE THAT MISTAKE. The game is a good challenge – you’re not going to breeze through the first level without dying like you might in other games, but it’s fair. You die often but it’s almost always because you were too aggressive and went for that one extra swing instead of dodging (you’re never killed by some random bull****) and the game is very clever about making dying part of the game. It’s not really frustrating to die – it never really seems like a big deal. I can get quite frustrated with games sometimes and with Bloodborne I’ve not once found myself raging, usually just finding myself saying “Nooooooo!” and laughing as my character bites the dust again. In a strange way, dying actually contributes to the nice flow to the gameplay which is so addictive. In the beginning it usually went something like this: I make a first foray into a new area, explore and get a feel for the enemies and layout, hopefully pick up a few items while I'm at it. Invariably I would die at some point and drop all my echoes (currency) but it's no big deal. I then take a second stab at the area and hopefully progress some more based on what I'd learnt. Eventually, I'll find one of the shortcuts which loop back to the lantern. This is great because now I can make trips into the area but more effectively get home to spend my echoes and gives me a faster route to some of the deeper parts of the zone and to the boss. There's a subtle repetition to it but in a thoroughly addictive way. Now, the bosses are a bit different and whilst they are still fair (people do no-hit, naked runs so you know there’s no RNG rubbish going on), some of them are very aggressive with wide swing arcs making them quite difficult. In every case I have been able to find a way to deal with them after a few tries, however. Worst case scenario, you do a few runs of your favourite zone to level up a bit more to help you or you can even summon an NPC or friendly player to assist you with that boss. There should never really be a situation where you face an obstacle that you cannot overcome with a bit of practice or levelling. Don’t be put off by the difficulty because if you like cool action games or RPGs like Skyrim/whatever, I’m willing to bet you would love this game if you tried it.",9,2017-05-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Captain_Chaos,"My experiences with the Souls series have run the gamut. After a disastrous experience with Dark Souls II almost put me off the entire franchise, a gamble on the third game paid off. As I understood it, III inherited some of its gameplay and mechanics from Bloodborne, a title I had initially overlooked given its PS4 exclusive status, meaning I would have no one to play coop with and no reason to resubscribe to Sony's money-grubbing. After a good experience with Dark Souls III and seeing an amusingly high number of Bloodborne cosplayers at Otakon 2016, I was inspired to get my hands on the title, and I'm glad I did. Almost everything about Bloodborne appealed to me. I believe it to be the best title in the series, though I cannot be certain having not played Demon's Souls or the first Dark Souls. Bloodborne trades the straight dark fantasy of its parent franchise for a victorian gothic-inspired setting, its knight's armors for leather coats and tricornes, the plain old swords for “trick” weapons with alternate functions, the arrows and magic for black-powder firearms, the undead for horrific, blood-addled mutants and its castles of dead kings for a doomed city at the mercy of cosmic-induced nightmares, all of which I found preferable for a long list of reasons. As a fan of leather, gunplay, creepy atmosphere, unnecessarily cool weapons (like the Threaded Cane, a weapon I loved so and found so versatile that I used it for my entire playthrough) and lovecraftian horror, Bloodborne was a treat for my aesthetic sensibilities. It also was a better fit mechanically for me, eschewing blocking almost entirely and instead forcing me to fight aggressively and in particular, master the art of stunning enemies with my gun to inflict the oh-so-satisfying visceral attacks, the key to success in a majority of engagements. I also enjoyed the rally mechanic, which allows the player to recover health they have just lost if they attack quickly enough. Lacking a Plus subscription, I was forced to face the terrors of Yharnam alone, a prospect I initially dreaded but eventually found agreeable, as it did away with what I feel is the series weakest and most aggravating mechanic: With no online connection, I could not be invaded and have my campaign play interrupted by some insufferable tryhard. And thanks to a post-release patch, I was able to summon NPC hunters for certain boss fights anyway. I could complain about the difficulty, but one does not play a Souls game for an easy experience, I suppose. There were some rather cheap deaths to be had, such as to the ridiculous Cainhurst NPC faced as part of Eileen the Crow's questline, who I was forced to cheese using poison knives, molotovs and whatever else I had on hand. A certain top-hatted, scythe-wielding hunter boss also posed some difficulty, making the final boss seem almost laughably easy by comparison. Oh, and the goddamn Winter Lanterns. Those things are straight up **** The biggest complaint I have is a obvious one. Where is the goddamned PC version? The quest for console exclusives continues to unimpress. I can only imagine how much more enjoyment I'd have gotten out of this game had I assistance from the crew of friends I negotiated Dark Souls III with, but alas, fun doesn't seem to be considered profitable. And neither is money itself, apparently, as I'm sure a PC version of this game would have seen considerable sales.",9,2017-05-20,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The change in DS combat system to fight more evasive, yet fast paced aggressive was the best choice. In this game it feels like a dance with blades. Combat never FELT so beautiful and addicting in any game ever.

Superwarx,"Este juego me agarró por sorpresa cuando lo compre y no se porque no lo hice ya que nunca me llamaban la atención los juego de la saga souls hasta ahora (excepto un poco en la casa de un amigo pero eso fue muy poco) , empezare con que la ambientación que he visto en un videojuego, los gráficos son decentes, el lore es muy interesante,el sistema de combate es muy bueno, jugué un poco a dark souls y mientras en ese juego el combate era más calmado, en bloodborne es más rápido y frenético pero no se siente que es un combate sin sentido y que solo consiste en golpear, me gusta decir que el combate es igual de profundo, siempre hay que saber cuando peleamos y nunca hay que confiarnos o si no ya conocen la famosa pantalla que aparece al morir. Las armas que podemos usar están muy diferenciadas una de la otra y son divertidas, aunque no se puede jugar de mas maneras como en dark souls y no se siente tan variada, cumple y te deja satisfecho. Lo que no me gusta aparte de que no podemos jugar de maneras muy variadas, es el modo multijugador, el sistema de las campanas puede ser aburrido al no encontrar otros jugadores y tardando hasta más de media hora en encontrar a alguien pero más allá de eso el juego es de los mejores para ps4, si todavía no lo has jugado y tienes ps4, esta es una compra obligatoria.",9,2017-04-21,PLAYSTATION 4,user

kizt,"From the same company that developed the Dark Souls series came Bloodborne. Let me start by saying that I have only played the first Dark Souls because ultimately comparisons will be made and my experience with Bloodborne will be based on Dark Souls because both games have a similar feel to it. Just like Dark Souls, Bloodborne is pretty minimalistic when it comes to storyline. The lore is deep but it takes effort to construct and understand it. This may be good or bad depending on your preference but this was a big deterrent for me with Dark Souls. I am also not a big fan of games that are challenging for the sake of being challenging. However, unlike Dark Souls, Bloodborne is a lot more forgiving. It does not require as much precision, health items are abundant and it has a mechanic that allows you to claw back lost health by being more aggresive. The biggest draw for me though is the world/level design. From Software have done a fantastic job with it. The gothic design and atmosphere is amazing and it made me want to keep playing just to find out more about the world. The sense of progression is also excellent. It may take a few tries to move forward sometimes but persevere and you will be rewarded with checkpoints or shortcuts. Bloodborne is a game that requires you to get better as you die again and again from your own mistakes. It can and will get frustrating at times. It is not everyone's cup of tea, that's for sure, and it is generally not the kind of games I like to play. I did, however, enjoy the game to completion and will look forward to the sequel.",9,2017-04-02,PLAYSTATION 4,user

HerrKapitan9,"Bloodborne is a master piece of our generation.... Everything nails it! the tone, the setting, the enemies, the story, the amazing trick weapons mechanic, that its simply a work of art. Considered as part of the Soul Series, this game has everything you want, and things you don't even know you wanted. The setting is this decayed scary and fantastic majestic city called Yharnam, so glorious and omnipotent as it is twisted and grotesque, filled with amazing vistas and detalis of its dark and almost evil secrets, simply put is one of the most compelling and beautify environment design i ever see anywhere. Most often giving you so much more context of the game, the night of the hunt and the world in general. The enemies and bosses are excellent !!! both in their design view point and their sense of danger, all of them are lethal and as the city itself, their design tells a story too, a story that goes so well blended with all the lore of the game, Boss fights are often terrifying, challenging andi have to say, very damned rewarding once you beat them! Some times alone and other with the help of otherhunters thanks to its multiplayer components. Another part of the game that is huge is this concept of Trick Weapons, these are fundamental to the over all gameplay and pace of Bloodborne and as all mentioned above, fits perfect in tis world, with this mix of gruesome lethality and smart mechanics. There is so much personality in the weapons you can use in the game and they are a lot of them! its a delight to see them in action. Overall, this game is a masterpeice, the lore and story as typical as the souls way, is hidden in the game, items, descriptions, etc, but is a very great story to be learned. The gameplay is almost tactical, with a frenetic pace that favours offensive play, but that punish you heavily if you don't respect the opponent you are against (other enemy hunters are the most wild and crazy fights in the game). Its a total challenge and it worth every second of it, lots of love and talent went into this game and it shows in the best way.

The graphics other than the character models themselves look great, the Gothic style they went for looks really dark and Victorian like. The music is as good as the souls games but the combat is what shines. Most people dislike dark souls because it's too difficult or they don't like being defensive but with Bloodborne, you get rewarded for playing offensive and it's easier in difficulty and for people to get into. This is a must own for PS4 owners and if you enjoy the souls series and haven't got this game, you need to.

Ledge_Pls,"Absolutely and without a doubt the greatest game of all time. In my own opinion of course. The combat is the culmination of years of perfecting and tempering already one of the most well designed and truly challenging 3rd person 3D combat systems every created...where player freedom, control and interaction with the player character is second to none. The quickstep and speedier gameplay has exalted the souls combat formula to a Godlike level of enjoyment in even the smallest **** true versatility, collage of attacks and combinations of just a single trick weapon will dazzle you with each and every satisfying, blood soaked slice into the flesh of your beastly grotesque enemies...Coupled with a world building skill that stacks up and towers over even some of the best games and an unrivaled and majestic attention to detail and atmosphere that has created one of the most intriguing, horrifying and exhilarating Victorian settings of all **** world, combat, atmosphere, music and sound design, story are all 10/10.... A difficulty that is completely and totally unforgiving and harkens back to an age when games were about overcoming a challenge rather than giving you a seemingly empowering cushy avatar to carry you through an big epic story..... and in that world the Souls games and especially Bloodborne are a shining star casting light upon a new era that enriches your soul with satisfaction upon REAL accomplishment rather than simply coddling your ego as you're spoon fed. But even that virtually pales in comparison to the absolute triumph of creating and delivering one of the best Lovecraftian pieces of art Ive ever had the pleasure of experiencing. For that alone the game is 10/10, truly nailing Lovecraft is quite possibly one of the hardest things to do in writing, because only a handful of people in the world have the skill needed to create the atmosphere and macabre fear of the unknown LET ALONE translate into visual media in video game no **** to mention the fact its a souls-like made by one of the best visionaries in his field Miyazaki-san is takes it to a level I had not thought possible in a video game because the souls formula is the best gameplay Ive encountered in my years since playing Legend of Zelda as a child.

Broyax,"Voici donc la suite de la série des souls (qui soûlent) ! et dorénavant nous aurons les Bouseborne qui cassent les burnes. C'est à peu près la même chose avec quelques petites différences : le personnage contrôlé est agile désormais et répond docilement aux ordres même si après 3 esquives seulement, il est déjà fatigué ! les monstres eux ne sont jamais fatigués... en plus de réapparâitre sans arrêt. L'ajout d'une arme à feu dans une main tandis que l'autre tient le coupe-coupe standard est une bonne idée pour sonner les ennemis à défaut de les tuer vraiment. Enfin, les décors font penser à l'époque du 19ème siècle anglais mais ici uniformément gris et délabrés, tarabiscotés et sinistres. D'un goût assez douteux et répétitif (presque aussi répétitif que peut l'être le 'gameplay'), tortueux et sinueux, ces décors ont malgré tout leur touche personnelle. La technique est en sensible progrès depuis les derniers souls sans être extraordinaire pour autant : il faut dire que tous ces environnements sombres constituent un parfait cache-misère. Mais revenons au jeu en lui-même : assurément plus jouable que les Souls si on fait abstraction de la caméra qui soûle (on revient de loin et ce n'est qu'un TPS d'amateurs après tout) il est tout aussi punitif et complètement à l'ouest dans sa gestion de la difficulté : un pauvre monstre peut enlever la moitié de votre barre de vie d'un seul coup et dans ce ""jeu"" où l'on passe sa vie à mourir, les temps de chargement scandaleusement longs achèvent de vriller les nerfs bien comme il faut. C'est fait exprès évidemment ! parce qu'il y a une demande masochiste d'une population blasée et désoeuvrée qui viendra rouler inévitablement des mécaniques à son premier 'boss' tué au bout de la nième tentative... et cela malgré toutes les larmes pour y parvenir. Car on recommence, on recommence, on recommence... jusqu'au par coeur ! c'en est risible et désopilant. Navrant également.

Ivan665,"Playing the game since 12/2016. Almost 2 years after release. I was wary, because I played DS2 before it, on PC, and I was dissatisfied by it. But I took the risk and got bloodborne. And I dont regret it. DS2 graphics were more like late PS2, early PS3 graphics, but Bloodborne's graphics are pretty good, even today. I must say this, because while gfx are not the most important thing, they are still a major factor. I havent played DS1 because of its PS1 graphics and clumsy controls on PC, and im yet to buy DS3 GOTY edition, so, to be tuthful and objective, I can compare it only to DS2, which I dropped about halfway, because it was boring. Bloodborne is the better game, by far. Graphics are nice, its aging well. Sound effects are well made. OST isnt great, but its well above decent. Atmosphere is one of the best, if not the best, of any game that Ive played, ever, and I have played alot of games, Ive been playing games since 1998. The immersion that this game's setting gives you is an absolute killer. It takes you in its gothic embrace right from the start, and you dont want to be released from it. Its better than Soul Reaver's and Devil May Cry's ones, something I thought was impossible, at least not in the near future, when I played those games. While DS2 had this generic feeling, something lacklusterly bland like ""Knights of the Temple"" mixed with Dungeon Siege. So boring, so uninspiring. Gameplay, the most important part, is much more engaging than DS2's combat. While in DS2 combat feels alot like turn based JRPG borefest, Bloodborne combat requires split second decisions and input, every second. Which is something that I welcome in a 3rd person hack and slash RPG. Animations are immensively smoother over DS2. Item system is not great, and not a typical RPG ""loot and equip better gear"". Its ""unlock gear and upgrade it alot"". So the weapons diversity is not great. But its not bad either. The weapons are not many, but they are very unique, they have 2 modes, and on almost all weapons the tricked, 2nd form version, is alot different than its 1st. And you can equip 2 weapons on your character at a given time, so essentialy you are fighting with 4 weapons + 1 pistol. And you have a few tools with various effects, ""spells"", that consume bullets, not mana. This opens crazy combo possibilities. Which are very satisfying. Stats system is on the bad side. You cant see exactly how much damage your weapon will deal in both of its forms, the stat screen only gives you an average. Nor what type of physical damage, and the game has several types, blunt, thrust, serratet, holy, etc. When you equip armor, you cant see the % redutions to damage it gives you, only a floating number, that means nothing without a way to calculate it. There is only higher and lower number, but how much reduction it gives is unknown. Which is stupid. Same thing with character stats on level up. There is no map, even after you beat an area/boss and loot every corpse, stone and trunk in it. This takes a bit from the immersion. On one side its good, because the level feels alot like a maze during the first go. But after completion levels are familiar and super easy to navigate, so a world wide map after completion would definetly increase the immersion. Story is not great, theres no denial. You happen to be in a bad place at the wrong time. there are e few dialogues but lore is very scarce. Everything is so vague that you quickly stop caring for it, and just beat the monsters and enjoy the great environments, which is good but still... more lore would have been nice. Thre is grind in the game. Once you get the hang of the combat mechanics and pace, the non bosses and non mini bosses are just filler. They can still 3 hit you and kill you, but they dont. You can simply reach a boss and be unable to kill it no matter how good you are, if your level is too low for it. Well you can, as I have on a couple of occasions, with trial and error (and dieing) you learn the boss moveset by heart, its animations to the frame, which takes some time, so youre better off grinding a few levels, which is faster, coming back, surviving a few hits and beating the boss, which still offers a very good challenge. So there is grinding, naturally. Bosses are the best thing about this game, thats why theres so many of them. With few of them, the most gigantic ones, there are camera problems. You just cant see the whole boss while hacking at his limbs, and you dont know what its doing and when its swinging. Luckyly for me, my TV has zoom out option, but still the could have just fix the camera for these bosses. One more problem and the last issue that I noticed. half of the weapons are in the DLC, locked behind a paywall. No problem for me, I got the GOTY and didnt have my PS4 until recently, but still... Anyway the game is great 9/10 for sure. If they want my 10/10 for Bloodborne 2 they have to improve on the exsisting RPG systems of the game and add more lore.",9,2017-03-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user
kriptomanki,"Bloodborne will appeal for those who jumped out of the window playing Dark Souls 3 and couldn't bear retrying a boss 150 times. Difficulty wise It's a watered down version of Dark Souls 3, but besides that an almost perfect game from FromSoftware's arsenal. DS3 fans might find it too easy. I recommend the Old Hunters DLC, which will bring their dose of daily suffering a reality. The best try or die action adventure ever released, not for the weenies, crybabies.

Take your time to learn how to parry with your gun as soon as possible and make sure to be on your toes as there are enemies hiding to surprise you throughout the game. The first time I played this it took me hours to unlock the first short cut I truly did **** at first, but now I've platinum the game and I have to say it's probably my fav game of all time, now. If I had to give any criticisms it would be that 1. I'm not that keen on the chalice dungeons but they are optional, and 2. I'm not a fan of the lantern system. In dark souls you can rest at the bonfires and easily farm items, where as in. Bloodborne you have to go back to the hunters dream and then back to where you were to replenish your blood vials.

SimonD00,"Wow, just WOW, this is easily on my top 3 games EVER. The combat is super fast and actionpaked but at the same time not so fast that you can't react. The bosses are all a big challenge but that is what makes the game fun, overcomming the difficulty. One thing I was happily surprised with was the story. In the dark souls series it's realy hard to understand the story without putting alot of time and effort into it and that's a good thing for alot of people, but bloodborne hits the sweetspot for me. You need to put time and effort in to understand every detail of the story but even without doing this you have a pretty good sence of what's going on. The only thing in this game that could be considerd a negative is that you character isn't as costomizable as in the dark souls games but for me personaly this is better because you don't get overwhelmed with stuff. So this is an easy 10/10",10,2017-03-08,PLAYSTATION 4,user

KingOfBurrito,"After completing the Platinum trophy for Bloodborne and experiencing all the game has to offer, it has shown itself to be a grotesque, punishing yet disturbingly beautiful game, which, despite its often crushing difficulty, remains mostly fair and balanced with only occasional minor departures from the established fairness. The strengths of Bloodborne come from its haunting atmosphere, along with shocking environment and enemy design, bolstered by extremely tight, responsive combat that makes a fresh departure from traditional, methodical Souls combat. The game also features an imposing soundtrack, adding a new layer of exhilaration to each boss encounter. The only issues I found with the game were occasional unfair fights, where the normal skill and reflexes needed to survive are replaced with luck, with difficult-to-dodge instant kill attacks being implemented. That being said, such issues are mostly only present within the optional Chalice Dungeons, and as such are unlikely to be experienced by most players. Despite the occasional unfair moment or drop in framerate or multiplayer matchmaking issue, Bloodborne delivers an exhilarating, horrifying journey through your deepest fears.",9,2017-03-04,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Omar_El_Azzouzi,"Bloodborne di something extremely cleaver for the genre. I'm a very big fan of the souls game and Dark Souls is one of my favourite games of all time, but Bloodborne, it suprised me. In this review I'm not really gonna talk about the story or anything allthough it has a more to your face story than Dark Souls, I'm gonna talk about one feature in preticular: the shields. Now in the Souls franshise shields have taken a really important role and it seemed pretty much essential, but it wasn't. Now this genre of gaming is not really appreciated by everybody, but BloodBorne was and I'm gonna explain why. There is two ways to play the souls games: The defensive way and the aggressive way. The aggressive way is the way to go either you're good at the game or not and I can say that as a long time fan. when someone recommends to their friend to play Dark Souls, they always recommend the defensive way wich is very repetitive and boring, so that person does not like the game any more after they played over an hour or two. That's why the aggressive way is better, it has more risk. If you play the defensive way, you're allways gonna use a shield. But what if there is no shield... From Software understood this problem very well and they thought that removing a feature from a game is not a good idea, so they made a new IP wich had the same gameplay as the Souls franchise with no shields so that people would allways take the aggressive approche (the way the games were supposed to be played). And thus Bloodborne was born (pun intended). And people loved it! So they wanted more. So they bought Dark Souls 3 and played the same way they played in Bloodborne. And they loved it. That's why it's the most highly rated in it's franchise. That's why I give this game a 10/10. I really recommend you play Bloodborne even if you're not a fan of the genre.",10,2017-02-28,PLAYSTATION 4,user

MorganDavies,"I've seen a lot of reviews on here that are slating the game because of its difficulty. I honestly can't see why. I've never played any games in the Souls series and I have never played any action-RPGs either so I bought this on a whim while it was on sale. I had been made aware that it was difficult so I gave it the benefit of the doubt. A few hours later with no progression and I thought that maybe it just wasn't for me so I left it for almost a month. Then after that time period I decided to give it another chance, and I'm so glad I did. I blasted through the game in a week and have a hard time not thinking about it. The art style is absolutely gorgeous; the character design is grotesque but beautiful and very innovative. Of course, there are some basic enemy archetypes (trolls, men with swords, etc.) but they are fuelled with the unforgiving difficulty. It's definitely a hard game, no argument there, but it's not difficult to the point where it's purely impossible. You will definitely see the ""You Died"" screen a lot but every time you see it, you'll be filled with just a little more knowledge and you will learn from your mistakes, and there are no drugs in the world that match the satisfaction from seeing the ""prey slaughtered"" screen after slaying a boss you've spent hours on. Also, the world design is so atmospheric; it's eerie and suspenseful and it will have you sweating bullets. For the most part, it takes away all of the typical jumpscares and replaces it with gross enemies that are hidden in plain sight, but it can't help but to throw a random enemy at you in the darkness. Overall, this game isn't for those who just want something that you can pick up whenever; it requires attention and know-how. It's challenging but not inaccessible; there is a steep learning curve but it's a game that's based around trial and error. It's definitely not everyone's' cup of tea but as someone who has never liked games in this genre, I was surprisingly captivated by it.",10,2017-02-28,PLAYSTATION 4,user
WarAlanmon,"Excellent RPG and well driven history. Great progression system of the character and the weapons. Extremely challenging, but the game rewards the exploration of the player and its really fair. Great bosses (there are exceptions like The Witches) and great lore of some of the characters. Many and different side quests also rewarding and beautiful landscapes of the places. I want to give a special mention to the soundtrack of the bosses fights and the design of them because some of them are fast and others are slow but really strong and you have to adjust your strategy to beat them. Anyway they will kill you in an instant if you distract or make some mistake. Also the sound and lighting of the areas is one of the best I´ve ever seen because they help to create the tension. I can´t give a ten because in some areas like the woods the frames drop a bit, but its no big deal comparing with the rest of the game.",9,2017-02-27,PLAYSTATION 4,user
beeryoghurt,"The return of Gaming. Wow. This game can make you swear, cheer, cry, and jump around the room flailing your arms in the course of a meager 10 minutes. Where most games nowadays try to tell a story, Bloodborne just gives you the reins and says: have fun. The game shows similarities to From Software's Dark Souls series, which are renowned for its high difficulty, excellent level design, and memorable boss fights. This game is arguably even better: from the Pre-industrial European setting to the combat, which is significantly different from Dark Souls. Bloodborne is inspired by H.P. Lovecraft's horror-fiction. This game sets this tone perfectly; grand Gothic churches, large clocktowers, carriages, and old gargoyle statues create an almost pittoresque world. Story telling is minimal, which helps add to the mystery and sense of danger in the game. From opening grand cathedral doors to ascending a ladder; you know one wrong move can result in death. The level design is, as expected, excellent. After traversing a level, a shortcut reveals itself, giving you easy passage to the lantern (bonfire), and with it; safety. The combat can be quite difficult in the beginning. Shields have all but dissappeared, making a defensive playstyle not really an option.. Side-stepping and getting in your opponent's face is the way to go: the game rewards you for being agressive. Nothing beats the feeling of a succesful visceral attack. I found myself dying at the first boss over and over; he is even considered one of the easier bosses of the game! Still, i was persistent and decided to 'git gud'. After downing my first two bosses, the game really 'clicked' for me: I was still dying occasionally to bosses, but after each defeat, I was asking myself what went wrong and how to improve. The game teaches you how to play along the way. Dying is just a part of the process forcing you to play more intelligently. The game gradually gets easier as you (and your character) get stronger. Nontheless, boss battles remain very challenging and rewarding. By the end, you'll greet death with a smile.",10,2017-02-26,PLAYSTATION 4,user
SuperMe,Bloodborne is an excellent game however it has a brutal learning curve which requires perseverance to overcome. You will die and replay the initial section of the game so many times you'll lose count and your commitment will be tested. You are punished for dying by what feels like a long re-spawn loading time and having to fight your way back through the same enemies you struggled to defeat the last time round. There is no quick save and re-spawn points are few and far between. Rather like Tom Cruise in Edge of Tomorrow you get a little better each iteration until eventually you succeed. Like a plane climbing through bad weather you punch through and into brilliant sunshine. The game remains hard but now you are competent in the mechanics it's a joy to play. You may chose to revisit the early section that caused so much frustration but this time your foe fall with consummate ease. It feels like redemption as you carve your way through the same enemies you previous struggled against now barely taking a scratch. Don't give up on this game and the reward will be many hours of fun. Update Shortly after writing my review I got bored with the repetitive nature of the game and had a few days off. I never went back. It's feels like a chore playing the game and a stressful grind. I play games for fun and when they stop being fun I stop playing.,7,2017-02-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user
HashZ21,"Bloodborne is what a game should aspire to be, fulfilling combat system, great level design and interesting world with mysteries in every corner that motivates a sense of exploration that the game supports. This is the best way for any studio to experiment with a few basic design ideas. Bloodborne build off the souls franchise while establishing it's own identity. Set in the beautifully macabre world of Yharnam, playing as a hunter was one of the most horrific and empower experiences on this generation of consoles. The bosses are generally well designed with a variety of types and sizes. The world itself feels alive in no small part due to the level of connectivity between areas. The game looks absolutely beautiful, from the Gothic castle, to the lake , woods and more. Now there are some issues that must me mentioned, the pre-patch load times show a lack of polish, there is a smaller weapon and location variety as compared to dark souls and the story is kept in the background. Some of these are more disclaimers for new comers, the lack of variety contributes to a streamline approach (not the same as dumbing down). The story is lovingly crafted (get it) and the world is genuinely a delight to explore. The combat system is massively satisfying and lends to great variety of combat styles and the sense of souls progression is alive and well.

BlakDak666,"I very rarely give games a 10, because a 10 to me is a groundbreaking, wonderful and stunning masterpiece that sets out its goals and nails them to a T. Is a 10 perfect though? No. Far from it. In fact, I do have some criticism for Bloodborne, but it is so minute and small, that it is an easy gloss-over when you consider the good it brings to the table. I want to note that I have played every Souls game (except Demon Souls) for over four years, but I try not to be a fanboy about things I like and objectively look at this game as a critic. Pros) 1) Environments are absolutely mesmerizing, beautiful, creepy and graphically well (aside from a few hiccups or textures). Yharnam is a Gothic-style city that drips with exploration and atmosphere that feels engrossing as ever before. 2) Combat is refitted, packed up with adrenaline and lets go of the weights of multiple armors, weapons and abilities to create a refining point of control and intensity. Enemies are ferocious, agile and brutal as ever to you, making you approach them with caution and read their moves down to avoid damage and more importantly death. The use of health regain by attacking offers more quick reflexes and encourages more fast thinking strategies that makes combat a frenzy of fun. You will die often though, so do not be fooled that this game is easier for you. 3) Bosses. Some of the best bosses I have ever seen in video games. You could say some are not that great and you would not be wrong, but some bosses (especially in the Old Hunter's DLC) are so well done in strategy, music and setting that it was one of the few games to make me cry. Not because I was sad, but I was so amazed by how powerful some of them were. Truly gripping to my soul as a fan of the series. 4) Music. One of the best soundtracks of any kind of music (gaming, rock, rap, country, etc.) I have ever had the pleasure of hearing. It uses orchestrated music and intense macabre style to make fights special and memorable. Even the decent boss fights have a good soundtrack to them that makes encounters great. If you are a music lover or do not want to play the game, listen to its tracks and be blown away on how well composed it is. It is worth your time. 5) Lore is really interesting and compelling. The Soul series is great at delivering lore dwelling incentives (not storytelling, big difference), and painting the realm of Bloodborne's world is special and fantastic. It can make amazing theories and discussions still to this day on reddit or discussion boards. It is insane, depressing and beautiful, all wrapped with a blood-soaked bow. 6) Weapons. I would argue that having less weapons is more in the context that making memorable and powerful weapons feel better than the overload of weapons in say Dark Souls 2. Each weapon transforms into a different variant when you ""trick it"" and some are cooler in others, but yet offer different approaches to combat that do not make them useless. Some might say the rifle spear and few other weapons are inferior to the Chikage and Ludwig's Holy Blade, but they are at least good and above average and neither a worthless weapon. The DLC weapons also make some of the coolest transformations the game will offer you and feel like a BAMF doing it. Cons: 1) Difficulty. If you are recurring Souls fan, this will be a breeze for you. Enemies will stagger easily and very few will give you a real challenge. Parrying bosses alongside regular enemies can be easy. As for brand new Soul players, this game will be a literal hell for you. A true test of skills and knowledge that will pull you out of the comfort zone that games tend to give you and make you die over and over again. You will fall off ledges, you will get killed and lose your echoes forever, you will be confused on everything. Do not be afraid though! Try to overcome and I promise you it will reward you with hard work you put into it! 2) PS4 exclusive. If you play Dark Souls on the Xbox or PC and are hoping Bloodborne comes over, it will not and never will. It is only on PS4, making those that don't have one pressured into buying it. I understand money can be an issue, but if you can you will not regret it. 3) The game is shorter and (even with the Old Hunter's DLC), you can beat it in 15-20 hours. I can see some seeing length and content an important deal, so I will not deny that it does feel short. But the lack of size makes up with a huge quality boost in atmosphere, bosses and much more. 4) PVP is hardcore to the invader, friendly to the host. If you are a huge PVP player in the souls games, this game will be hard for you to get on board with. Host has more advantages than invader and lag is there (and it does ****). If you like challenge, try it regardless but be warned that some deemed it inferior to DS1 and 2. Despite this issues, Bloodborne is still a master work of art. It delivers an experience that is unique, refreshing and refined. A game worthy of a 10/10.",10,2017-01-30,PLAYSTATION 4,user

However, once I'd discovered the masterpiece that is Dark Souls 3, I was craving more of the same. I very quickly realised I was wrong to dismiss this game. It delivers just like DS3. The choice to remove shields and add the ability to rally back your health is a master stroke! Two aspects that are not masterstrokes however are: - Having a finite health source, therefore farming is a thing, a really tedious thing - Having to teleport back to the hubworld before teleporting again, just make it one step These two points caused too much frustration to give this game a perfect score, but it deserves a lot of praise. The creatures fit very well with the story. The story is sparse but the lore is really effectively at developing the mysterious setting. This game creates an incredible atmosphere and has the player in awe, fear and euphoria throughout.",9,2017-01-28,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Leo_Manzano,"Bloodborne is the new franchise of Fromsoftware directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki creator of the games of the Souls franchise. While Bloodborne is undeniably a game of the Souls franchise he brings his own style and attractive. The game brings many elements of Darksouls as the intense difficulty that provides a sense of accomplishment when we finally managed to pass from a difficult part, the bosses of colossal size and all mechanical part of level up and attributes of the characters, but what really makes Bloodborne incredible Are not their similarities with Darksouls but rather their differences. Among these differences one that already calls attention right away is the combat from the beginning the game will teach you that if you want to survive in Bloodborne you must be aggressive. At the same time that the player can not be afraid to attack the creatures that devastate the city of Yharnam he also can not feel too confident because any carelessness can be mortal no matter how powerful his character is. Also another thing that draws attention and all the Victorian style and a way of horror worthy of Lovecraft where the horror lies in beings and forms incomprehensible to a mere human mind. The story of the game follows the line already used by Miyazaki in his previous games being told through the description of the items and the interpretation of the dialogues with the NPCs providing a different interpretation of the plot for each player and bringing much to explore in the game. As for the technical side I can only say that the art direction and sound of the game are amazing provided gorgeous scenes and memorable track during the boss fights. Finally we came to the conclusion that Bloodborne is one of the best if not the best exclusive of Ps4 that brings hours of exploration and engaging combat that can extend even more with the new game plus, so if you and fan of the Souls franchise this game will You please and if you did not play or did not like Darksouls give Bloodborne a chance because with his fast and aggressive fighting style will vitiate you.",10,2017-01-26,PLAYSTATION 4,user

kingkiller1001,"I'm late giving a review, game is almost 2 yrs old, but for this 41 yr old gamer this was his introduction into From Software. Boy oh **** took a day for me to declare that this was the greatest game I've ever played PERIOD...This is an absolute masterpiece to the point that to date I've created 4 characters and have a total playtime (between 4 characters) of 1,000 hrs...ingenious implementation of PvP and/or Co-op to a Souls virgin. Between the blissful combat, The Lore- straight out've Lovecraftian masterpiece of Chutulism, This game (IMHO) could've only been done right from one developer (FromSoft) and only from one Director (Hidetaka Miyazaki) could this game been seen. There's a reason it sold 1 million copies the first month of release (unheard of for a PS4 exclusive) after a week in I purchased Dark Souls 1, 2 SotFS, 3 (for both current gen consoles)....A fricking Masterpiece",10,2017-01-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user

phantomlord,"This was my first From Software souls/borne game and I was amazed at how fast it reeled me in. I can 100% see how some players might be very put off by Bloodborne and its Dark Souls counterparts but like many people have said before, overcoming the difficulty is insanely rewarding. The game is very very good at pacing and keeping it interesting. The level design, bosses and the score are insane. The weapons and their transformations are among some of the most inventive I've seen. Everything looks very masterfully created and handled with care. I was amazed at how quickly the game pulled me in and made me feel compelled to play. 2 months ago I had never played a Souls/borne game and now I feel like I could be a Bloodborne spokesperson. I have never played a game that made me all shaky and anxious during boss battles. During many of the later boss battles my heart was pounding for minutes after the boss fell and PREY SLAUGHTERED appeared on the screen. I found myself thinking of the game constantly and wanting to ditch all other responsibilities to sit down and play. Bloodborne is now easily in my top 5 games of all time.",10,2017-01-16,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Dukery,When you play a game you want to be entertained. You want to have a good time and feel good. This crap on the other hand does everything to bring you the exact opposite. When dying on a boss (they are ridiculously difficult) you not only have to walk a long time to get to them again. No. You are standing there without the items needet to defeat them. So every new try you first have to farm the items. Again and again. This is punishment of the highest level. Can not recommend this game game to anyone but masochists.,0,2017-01-13,PLAYSTATION 4,user
gusman,"After a ton of hours (180+) played on this game I must admit I was totally wrong. It's really a master piece. It has a very deep history, but it's not told to you as usually a gamne does, the universe is really well fitted and it's usually described through items. Also, the difficulty is really high, but that at the end is what does you to feel so good when you kill a boss... So, after playing this I had to play all the souls saga, and I'm really happy as I became a souls fan.",9,2017-01-12,PLAYSTATION 4,user
BrunoZibordi,"This was my first souls game, and also the first game I got a platinum trophy. It really hold my attention for months, with it's brilliant level design, magnificent orchestrated soundtrack, fast-paced gameplay and beautiful art direction. I never wanted to play a souls game because I'm not a defensive shield and sword type of player, and Boodborne brings the opposite of that, as it rewards you when you play fast and aggressive, and gets you killed when you get too defensive. Most players will need some time to adapt as it has a very specific concept of gameplay, with no mini-map, few checkpoints, and the way you are most of the time totally clueless about what is going on, combined with it's hardcore battle system in which a simple mistake can and will get you killed. But the difficulty works in a way that every progression feels like a real achievement. It's challenging, but not over-challenging in a boring ""can't progress in the story"" way. Another great point for me was the aesthetics chosen, pretty much different from the medieval design of Dark Souls. Bloodborne's visual concept draws influence from Victorian Age gothic horror, and HP Lovecraft's cosmic horror. The game feels a lot like a nightmare, with its city of dark alleys and impossible architecture. Most of the time you don't know where the enemies are hiding and it compels you to pay attention to the environment which is great because the art direction is really beautiful and the level design is made in a way you easily memorize your path through the areas. Definitely a must have if you're into this specific kind of game, which will not please everyone. The DLC ""The Old Hunters"" is amazing, and brings a lot to the game in therms of possibilities, lore and challenge.",10,2017-01-11,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Vicjo,"The first impresión of bloodborne was that the game was a insane, I died constantly for hours and I didn´t get go forward, but little by little you go learning to dodge, to attack in the right time, shortcuts that allow find news zones, and each dead serve for improve, in summary is a game challenging but very gratifying. The graphics and especially the artistic desing is awesome, you can stay watching the landscapes for minutes. The gameplay at the beginning is rough but once mastered is a lot of agile and fun. In my opinion is the best game I´ve played in ps4 at the moment, the only one that keeps trapped until that you pass the game.",10,2017-01-09,PLAYSTATION 4,user

No, thank you. I do not read for the love of pain, nor do I game for the love of frustration. If I purchase a product, I should expect that it be made to function for me, not that I should be made to function for it. A game developer should, in turn, make a game suited for the average player, and not exclusive to the exceptional elite. This is what difficulty settings are for, so that those who wish to test their formidable skill against more challenging obstacles may do so.

ozcomz,"I had fun reading the negative reviews. I played about one hour of Dark Souls 2 on the PS3, so I'm hardly a Dark Souls fan by any definition of the word, yet I love this game. Some say this game is too hard... some say it's hard for the wrong reasons (bad controls, bad mechanics)... some say it's repetitive... some say the story is lacking... some even say it looks like a last gen port... After playing for about 15 - 20 hours at level 30 now, I feel like I can write a review on how I feel. First the difficulty. It's hard, AT FIRST, but becomes easier after the learning curve. And that's what those negative reviews culminate into; people who couldn't get past the learning curve of the game. I would say the learning curve for this game is between 6 - 10 hours, depending on how good you are. That's not bad considering games like Monster Hunter with a 20+ hour learning curve. You will die, A LOT in those first few hours, the story will feel lacking, and the controls will seem clunky. After hour 8 for me, I got the hang of finding shortcuts, and I started to understand what the story was about... Just encountering new enemies gives you an understanding of the story in this game. It isn't heavy on the cut screens, and I'm still learning about the world, but it rewards you if you pay attention. I absolutely LOVE the challenge this game offers. I don't find it repetitive, I find it rewarding. The feeling of finally defeating a boss you died 10 times trying to kill fills you with accomplishment... The frustrations turn to joy and you feel like you can really celebrate going into the next part of the map. Having to fight enemies that respawned before getting to the boss gives you some time to cool down and plan your next strategy before your next attempt. After the learning curve, the controls feel INCREDIBLY intuitive and comfortable. I feel like so much thought was given into designing the difficulty of this game. The balance is right for the experienced and hardcore gamer who will find what's been missing from their game library. In comparison, most games these days feel like you die just because you've taken too much damage, but in these types of games the difference between life and death can be in how you time your dodges and attacks, or proper use of items. The world is beautiful and dark; it looks every bit like a current gen game. The game has a very warm color balance to it, with the early dawn sky appearing as a bright orange and red. The levels and characters emphasis the gothic nature of the game, and add to the realization that something went terribly wrong in this world, further enhancing the story. Like I said, it rewards you to pay attention to these things. My load times are quick after the updates with my 7200rpm hard drive. I never feel like load times are an issue with my updated drive. This isn't a day 1 glory review, this is an objective review from a player who had put in the hours to beat the learning curve... A player who pays attention to the world to fully grasp what the developers were trying to tell me about the story... And a player who waited 18 months before buying the Complete Edition of Bloodborne for $20... A player who usually doesn't enjoy dark games and has never really played a Dark Souls game. This game isn't for casual gamers, and some negative reviews say that's a problem, but that adds to the uniqueness of games like this. If it were easy, would it be fun? Or would it just be another game to beat and put back on your shelf? I ask you, fellow gamers, why do you game? For me, it's for an experience like this, that will keep me coming back to prove I've got what it takes to overcome. An experience I look forward to, for the lore, for the challenge. This game made me interested in games like Dark Souls, and I very much look forward to playing Dark Souls 3 for the same experience.",10,2016-12-29,PLAYSTATION 4,user

ABOGANGSTER81,"Bloodborne is a master piece, it´s one of the best games you will play, his graphics, weapons, beasts, the most difficult and best bosses you are going to find. The gameplay is very similar to dark souls, the difference is that they quit away the child an that make you to play more aggressive, and i think that is better than dark souls",10,2016-12-15,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Archulysses,"Story - As synopsis, Bloodborne centers on the Hunter (which is you) in his fight against a plague which turns those infected to mindless and ferocious beasts that occurs in the city of Yharnam. In addition, in finding the secrets and the source of such epidemic. The story telling of Bloodborne is like all souls series is unconventional. They wont tell you the story in game nor give you clear details on what's happening around you and it can either be good or bad depending on the player. As for me though, Id say it is on the positive side since it encourages players to read the description of each and every items, weapons, armors, etc. in the game and in that way give their personal understanding and theories regarding the state and what's happening in the world of Bloodborne. Though i have slight reservation since sometimes i get out of place or confused in its story and kinda a hassle to read everything in game. Therefore, A score of 9/10 deserves this spot. Gameplay - Like all Souls game, this has alway been their home turf. The gameplay overall is amazing, it is strict, challenging but fair. I loved how the developers managed to make a slow approach style of gameplay of the souls series to an aggressive and fast paced approach of Bloodborne. It is challenging and a new fresh experience for its hardcore fans. The bosses is what really the cherry on top of Bloodborne, even though some can be quite easy, majority of them are all memorable and challenging that depending on your skill, may put you to rage but gives you that hard earned satisfaction upon beating them. The weapons is also one of its best assets in that regard that they can transform to a second form which you can use in different situations in game. That is the true reward for beating them. As to the multiplayer aspect, I loved how they changed the backstab system of this game to repel cheating players. A truly masterful execution that deserves a perfect 10/10 Graphics - What really got me to love this game firsthand is its theme and environment. The gothic horror-esque world of Yharnam to its scary forest, sewers, cemetery, school, etc. and even abandoned snowy castles exists in the game which gives you the players that creepy feel before going to that area. In addition, The monsters of this game are for me one of the most grotesque but all coolest designs i have ever seen in my gaming life, majority of them are all scary and creepy. Add that to the fact that the weapons and armors (or cape/coats) are cool and awesome design. I really loved it. My main issue in the game though is even though everything is pretty, the graphics of the game is not really that impressive and its fps is just a constant 30 fps which drops occasionally in fights. Regardless, still a pretty game to look at and scary too. Thus, I will give a score of 8/10 for this. Music and sound - As to music, its average for me. I cant say it isnt good but i cant say its bad either. However, the sound of this game is what really lifts it up too, the voices of the characters even if they all have few dialogues are great and also the scary sounds and screams which the monsters and the beasts of Yharnman makes in the game which adds to that uneasy feeling for the players. It is a job well done in this aspect. Therefore, a score of 9/10 also gets this spot. Total average = 9.00 Another great game made by one of the best developers Japan has. Even though everyone is used now to the gameplay of the Souls series, FromSoft still found a way to give us a new experience and freshen up its gameplay in Bloodborne. I loved their effort and creativity to dwell in a gothic horror theme. Miyazaki is really a genius in world and environment design. I really hope that they continue to be this great as developers and not let fame get over their heads. Thank you for a very good game.",9,2016-12-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The graphics are great, little performance issues, great soundtrack, fun combat, the transforming weapons are great and original, the combat is fast paced, great fun and feels pretty fair mostly. The DLC is great and fixes a lot of the issues the game had at launch such as a lack of ability to farm materials. I highly recommend it. My only real gripes for this game was the broken multiplayer. The bell system was just completely broken. But it has been kind of fixed now. It is passable. Also the chalice dungeons are incredibly boring and monotonous until you get to the original bosses.

This is a re-textured version of dark souls II, but who cares? It's a fun game! Let's start with the story, so you're this all powerful hunter that goes around yiffing the **** of ugly-ass monsters. Most of the bosses are clever and fun to fight against, some of them are just awful and will just frustrate you (like that jerk who wears a cage on his head... that guy made me throw my ps4 controller and now one of the grips is a little bent) Oh you better believe this game is hard, it'll piss you off. I started yelling at the game (especially the blood starved beast and Moon Presence) calling them words I will not repeat in this review, and I'd say 60 percent of the time, when you get hit or killed, it's your own fault. There are enemies with insta-kills and some craptastic frenzy ability, but usually once you defeat them, they're done forever. This game is not a walk in the part. Don't let the goofy looking weapons fool you, along with the relatively easy start. This game is about being the best guy ever, or getting your **** knocked off. The graphics and environment are gorgeous. Is this a perfect 10/10? Hell no, all the 10's are **** **** ""from software"" fan boys that probably haven't played the game, and all the 0's are **** **** ""xbox"" fan boys and every critic giving this game a 10 are lying to themselves.

Overall a fun game with plenty to enjoy including those gimmicky dungeons with half HP and other quirks to keep it challenging.

Tselel,"Story/Campaign - Now, we all know Bloodborne doesnt really give the game's story outright to the player. But if we had time and put some effort in reading the lore in the description of various items, weapons, armors, rings, etc. Then you will now how rich the lore and story of bloodborne **** make it short, it tells the story of a hunter (which is the protagonist) who visited Yharnam to find a cure known as paleblood for his unknown illness but the problem occurs that the Paleblood had side effects which makes the ones who use it to become beasts. It is now your role as a hunter to hunt the beasts of Yharnam, find survivors and look for the main source of the problem while also fighting your bloodlust to become a beast. It is cool and I love how Fromsoft made this kind of storytelling. A good 9/10 score. Gameplay - This is the real strength of the game and a real killer (literally) for the gamers out there, warning: IT IS NOT FOR CASUALS OR THOSE WHO WANT TO ENJOY A GAME. Its fast, difficult and the enemies are all aggresive and could kill you fast if you dont know what to do or you dont plan ahead. What I really love from this game is its weapons which can transform to two forms or other uses like can be buffed or can also be used as a gun, etc. The bosses are difficult but beatable and awesome fights will come your way. A masterpiece but brutal gameplay for me. A very good 10/10 Graphics - Now, The game's graphics especially the environment are all good. I love how Yharnam's design has a gothic horror theme about them, and you will also pass some different and terrifying places like a large forest with a lot of snakes, a former church dominated by beasts a school which is hunted by its occupants and different nightmare which you will encounter grotesque and horrific monsters. My only issue is its frame drops when in intense fights and also how the armor of the game are alike with each other which lacks divisibility. Still though, a great 9/10 for me. Sound - Well, the sound of this game really puts the chills out of you esp the sound of thos ****, i really hate those **** themes are all ok and good but all in all no song nor theme really made me go wow or gave me memorable moments. A good 8/10 for me. Total Average - 9.25 From Soft really did a good job of making a Unique Souls-game type with making it faster and encourages more aggressive gameplay rather than hide in a shield and take it slow approach of gameplay. I really am happy how the souls has impacted the gaming industries and put that classic ""difficulty"" back in the discussion. A true masterpiece to me.

evilghost666,"The best souls game period. Combat is fast and fluid with no more turtling behind shields and really upping the ante by allowing you to regain your HP by being bold and viciously attacking. The level design is better than any game I have personally played. The scenery is lush, haunting, foreboding and masterfully crafted to confuse and lure you deeper in the labyrinthine tunnels and traps. Oodles of trap doors, secret passages, mystery and allure... This game really will **** you in. The creatures are as hellish and eldritch as you can imagine and the horror aspect on this game is played up more, evoking some genuinely scary and tense moments where you just dont want to turn the next corner and see whatever horros await. A perfect balance between white knuckle fierce gameplay and eerie, spooky horror. BUT BE WARNED: This is a souls game and honestly, especially with the DLC release, is probably also the hardest of the souls games (makes DS3 look like a joke).

Ishi123,"Bloodborne. Bloodborne, Bloodborne, Bloodborne. Bloodborne is my favorite game. Ever. Of 15 years of playing video games, this is the first that I can point to and say ""that one is my favorite"". Bloodborne, though a step away from Dark Souls in combat and setting and lore, feels right at home with its Souls brethren. It's dark, it's grotesque, it's genuinely terrifying at times, and it's absolutely wonderful. The areas are as stunning as the graphics that create them, and the combat is slick, fast, and oh, so satisfying. Some Souls veterans found the transition from the slow, cautious approach to the fast, aggressive, in-your-face style of Bloodborne to be grueling, but I took the transition quite well, to be honest. I fancy this game's combat more than the Souls method of doing things. Instead of being cautious and waiting for the enemy to make the first move, you are constantly encouraged to take the initiative and drop enemies as quickly as you can. Be fast and be aggressive. Even towards the game's many original and well-designed bosses, this is the key to success. You have to juggle watching the enemy's moves, reacting in time, and taking every single opportunity to attack in your head simultaneously for every one of these drawn out battles. You can't afford to watch them and learn them, you have to learn them while you're on the attack. Don't let them push you into a corner; get them before they get you. The enemies are unforgiving, even more so than in previous titles, due to the faster nature of the combat. If you let them take the advantage, it will be difficult to get it back. The story of Bloodborne is equally as entrancing. Just like the Souls series before it, the story is told through the experience, with very little exposition, encouraging exploration of the world in order to piece together the story. From werewolves and mad villagers, the story descends, or ascends, depending on who you are, to eldritch horrors and Lovecraftian nightmares, as you begin to uncover what the world around you truly is, all the while questioning if you should go further, and every time being unable to resist delving deeper into the nightmare. The game's level design goes back to the Dark Souls style, with large, open-ended areas and few places of reprieve, but plenty of shortcuts that loop back in and around each other adequately enough. The largest area of the game has a single lantern for safety, and going through that terrible place all the way to the first shortcut, emerging on the other side to see the lantern there was a moment that made me jump out of my seat with excitement, and gave me confidence to keep going. Just as Dark Souls was, this is a game about honing your skills. The enemies will get much tougher, but so will you. You will evolve to meet the challenges ahead of you. From those first tentative and nervous steps out onto the bloodied cobbled streets of Yharnam, you will become a lethal blur, steel flashing as you cut into your enemies and watch them fall around you by the end of the game. You will learn to take things methodically, but at the same time quickly and efficiently, a phrase that makes more sense should you play the game. Bloodborne successfully blends in caution and aggression in a way that no other game I have played has, and it's a beautiful sight to behold when you duck under the lunge of a rabid werewolf only to slide into his side and let loose a flurry of your own, felling the beast in a matter of seconds. All-in-all, this is my favorite game in the Soulsborne series. It's refined without feeling stale. It's fast and aggressive without feeling overwhelming (most of the time...), and it's beautiful and horrifying at the same time. If you are a fan of the Souls series, and hell, even if you aren't and just have a PS4, this game is a must buy. Just like Dark Souls, it's a game that will punch you down into the ground and tell you to stay there, fully expecting you to get right back up and refuse to do so, and it will reward your perseverance with a rich world and story, satisfying and high-paced combat, and a true feeling of accomplishment that is only worthy of the greatest of Hunters.",10,2016-10-27,PLAYSTATION 4,user
DragonBorn-,"This is surely one of the best games ever made. It's horrible, brutal, unforgiving and IT HATES YOU. Bloodborne is not for the faint hearted. Its overall difficulty is that bad its nearing on the ridiculous. It took me 10 tries just to beat the first boss and looking back after completing it, it was the easiest boss of the game! My advice to anyone playing it is don't give up! The game is so rewarding the further down the line you get and once you finish it, you feel like you've accomplished something which is just stupid because its only a video game! Bloodborne like all From Software games rewards patience. You need to study your enemies movements and attack patterns. Knowing when to strike and when to parry. You COULD just go all out **** you won't last 5 seconds. You will soon realise this game hates you and does everything in its power to kill you! Play it properly and it is one of the finest gaming experiences you can get. The sole reason this game doesn't get a 10 is because the graphics are the only point in my opinion where i feel the game can improve. But its that good i don't care. 9/10.

AnimeKing,"Fun, punishing, pissed me **** part of the game. Graphics, looks ok the cut scenes did look pretty well Sounds, not off but nothing that stands out Gameplay, It's just like Dark Souls series but without a shield, if you choose there is a shield in the game but just 1, you off hand a gun for damage and stagger use. you will need to dodge a lot. The weapons have a normal version like a sword but they alternate version or bigger version can attach, add magic, or extend to give you more power but slower some times. Overall, If you played Dark Souls this 1 will be a slight adjustment but the same punishing feel and ""Get Gud"" attitude is still there.

kgartner,"I have completed about 30+ titles on the ps4 ranging from the uncharted series, gta, assassins creed series, fallout 4, the witcher, COD series etc.... and after playing 3 - 4 hours of Bloodborne, I came to the conclusion it is the WORST game I have played. Reading all the high reviews on this website and the high scores, I spent a few hours going through forums and trying to find out what the hype was about. What am I missing. Most websites said that you need to be ""patient"", ""expect to die a lot"", ""get past the first 20 - 30 hours and you will love it"". I have played 30-40 hours (I have had an operation and laid up on the couch) and I came to the conclusion it is the WORST game I have played by a long way. Dont believe the hype. It is for a gamer who doesn't mind doing the same levels and killing the same creatures over and over again to the point it is painfully monotonous. For example, the save points are only available after killing a boss. After dying probably 30 - 40 times (remembering all creatures respawn once you die or go back to the hunters dream) trying to find the boss, getting shortcuts and exploring the level, the distance to get to the boss is probably 1 - 2 minutes average after completing the shortcuts. So every time you die trying to beat the boss (most of the time you die frustratingly) you go back to the start and spend the 1 - 2 minutes killing the exact same monsters on the way back to the point again. It is that tedious. You end up killing the same creatures over and over and over and over again. And it is always fun (sarcasm) when one of the creatures that you have killed what feels like a million times, suddenly does this unexpected move and kills you and you have to start all over again.... Then there is also the headache of when you will be 90 % of a way through a level and have a high level of blood (used for upgrades etc... and you lose them if you die) so you have to retrace your steps alllllll the way back to the starting point to go to the hunters dream to use them. But when you go back, all the creatures you have just killed have respawn. And when you find something new, it is generally unimpressive. Upgrading the character is slow and tedious. Bosses are frustratingly hard. I keep on see in reviews that it is a game that forces you to be patient which I think they mean by doing monotonous and tedious things hours and hours and hours... I dont find this fun and I find it strange that people think that this is what qualifies as a good game. I gave it a one star as the graphics and atmosphere are really good. But absolutely everything else just lets this game down. It is a bit late putting in this review but I wanted to put the warning out there to anyone else looking at buying it at this later stage. Save your money. Buy a good game from the many other titles out there. Glad to get that off my chest.",1,2016-09-27,PLAYSTATION 4,user

brothers54321,"Its time this game got an honest review it deserves and earns. Don't just automatically assume any game with critical acclaim is a quality title. I write this review as I lost 2 hours worth or ""Blood Echoes"" after already becoming sick of the game from the 3 hours worth of ""Blood Echoes"" I lost the last time I played. The game isn't like a good RPG where you gain experience at a decent pace and have realistic opportunities to save your progress. No instead you are constantly tensed up fighting enemies that give you virtually no experience to work with which you can instantly lose because the enemy difficulty level is ridiculously unforgiving. I've played video games for over 15 years and usually a game with an unbalanced difficulty level and unfair challenge is regarded as a failure. It isn't fun to spawn, walk 20 steps, encounter a group of eneimes you can barely beat if you tease their aggression radius, then walk 20 more steps to die to an enemy ambush you could never have predicted, then spawn again in a panicked attempt to get all the levels you grinded for, and die again without ever recovering them. Why is it then that the Bloodborne and Dark Souls series gets a pass when no other game does? That's not to say its all bad, as the combat is uniquely satisfying when you can actually stand a chance. Its really the only thing that kept me coming back to give the game a second chance. But then I'd instantly remember why I couldn't stand the game again, because I'd walk the same 20 steps I'd walked 10 times over and die again. I'm sure there is something I'm missing that might make the game more enjoyable, but if there is its too cryptic for me to find and thus again would be bad game design. I get that a game needs a challenge to be fun, and I'm sure for many Bloodborne is the pinnacle **** challenge they have been waiting for. But if you are like me and only have so much time to devote to gaming each day and prefer games that you can actually progress in, you will probably just feel frustrated and cheated out of the money you spent. However if you enjoy walking down the same corridor 10 different times doing the same thing till you get lucky and progress, Bloodborne is perfect for you.",5,2016-09-15,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Trust me, i have been gaming for almost 30 years, have played almost every game under the sun on PC,console and handheld.

The graphics/art style is quite nice and could be reason enough for some to want to play it. I never encountered any ""hit box issues"" and the character movement was quite smooth.

MerodeTalks,"Bloodborne is a very solid game. It's one of the few games I felt empty a few days after finishing it (I missed killing bosses). Bloodborne is a game that concentrates on gameplay aspects and if you're not careful you might not notice story at all. It reminds me of old-school games that used to be very difficult and haven't had 'objectives', 'markers' and all other stuff pointing you in the right direction. There are vast sections you can ommit if you're not careful. At least half of bosses are optional. Graphics and audio are very good and style is very memorable. Framerate wasn't the issue and was smooth. Keep in mind I played the game with the latest patches. This game gives you clear objective - go and kill bosses. Most of them are difficult and I was shouting and swearing a lot. This might have shortened my life a few months but it feels so great once you kill a boss you've been trying to kill so many times. By the way, some mobs (other hunters) are more difficult than 90% of bosses. Some areas in general are more difficult than most bosses. If you don't have patience or you don't have means to let the pressure off when losing, please don't bother. You'll save yourself much stress.",8,2016-08-10,PLAYSTATION 4,user

windxtravelerx,"I never thought i would say this, but for the first time ever i've played a FromSoftware game and i just hated it. Having played from Demon's Souls to DS3 i thought that this game would be awesome, and it is, to some extent. The graphics are beautiful, the atmosphere is quite good and the gameplay is quite fast, however this is the biggest flaw in this game. The combat is more frenetic and everything is fast, except you. Your character is still a slug compared to other enemies or bosses that can in quick sucession attack you 4-5 times without leaving you space to roll or evade their attacks. Also, this game forces you to fight against multiple enemies the whole time, something that the much despised DS2 do all the time. It's annoying and cheap since you can only lock into one enemy at time, you can't use lock on and hope to attack everyone without any problem, you might get lucky but most of the time you'll end up dead quickly because all enemies in this game are ferocious. Also, your character is just a blind moron that misses his/her attack almost everytime unless you're using the lock on. So most of the time when you have to fight against mobs you'll end up hitting the air more than the enemies themselves. The bosses in this game are boring and yawn-inducing. Not even one of them are actually interesting, which is weird since From never had a lot of problems with boss design. The game also stripped down a lot of RPG elements from Dark Souls or Demon's Souls. Gone are the weight system, the poise and etc. You can still level up your char but you'll end up investing only in three attributes: Vitality, Endurance and Strength because the other attributes don't really make a lot of difference to your character's overall stats. You also have less armor, weapons and items overall, which is disappointing and it feels just a lazy job from FS. You pick one weapon and just keep with it until the end because it's not worth to change it. Of course that the Trick System adds a more interesting interaction with all weapons and also add some strategy to this game. There's also magic, which is called Arcane here, but i never used and as far as i'm concerned is really gimmicky and just ridiculous, it doesn't work like it works in DS or Demon's Souls. The game is quite short and the journey itself is quite forgettable. I'm sure that most people don't ever come back again to this game after finishing it once or twice because of the length of the campaign, the scarcity of weapons and armors and etc. You can't create dozens of different builds because of the attributes limitations. The only thing that you can change is your weapon, the rest is just unecessary unless you want a big challenge playing with an only-arcane build or only-firearm build or **** thing that this game does quite well, though, it's killing you with cheap deaths. The sensation that i had while playing this game, specially at the last half of it, is the same feeling that i had while playing DS2, which is not a good thing. Simply put, the game starts quite hard but because the enemies are just too strong and the fact that BB forces you to use the ""parry"" attacks (here know as visceral attacks) makes the game harder and just an annoying festival of hit and miss attacks with wrong timed-shots happening almost everytime. After a while you start to upgrade your weapon and the firearm becomes almost useless to a extent. But after halfway throught the game you'll start to see something changing: Enemy placement. It seemed that FromSoftware wanted to use the same strategy as Yui did and decided to just place a bunch of enemies everywhere just to kill you over and over again. You'll start to see how hard the game becomes out of nowhere. You'll be surrounded and destroyed by 2 or 3 attacks from 4 or 5 enemies at once. This is not an exaggeration. If you pay attention to the game you'll see that almost never you'll experience framerate drops, but at the end of the game this will start to happen almost the whole time, because of how much enemies the developers put into a single area, just pay attention and you'll see. With a short campaign, uninspiring bosses, frustrating gameplay mechanics, less weapons, less armor, less optiions, less RPG and more hack and slash and cheap deaths, BloodBorne it's an annoying brat who wants all attention and everytime you have to let it win because he wants. It's a bad game and i'm reallyyyyy disappointed to spend my money with this game and its DLC. Just stick with DS3 on your PS4 and you'll be fine.",3,2016-08-08,PLAYSTATION 4,user

It's level design, while not as intricate as in Dark Souls 1, is masterfully crafted. The combat is smooth, challenging and rewarding, and the bosses are, for the most part, utterly outstanding. The sound design is beyond perfect, with one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard, superb voice acting, and just sounds in general that will make your blood freeze. And last but not least, the lore is the most well written and depressing in any game ever, and delving deeper into the mysteries of Yharnham and the healing church, makes each encounter much more satisfying.

Provided you can manage the somewhat steep learning curve and a generally high difficulty, you will enjoy this game. Yes, it is difficult and unforgiving but it is also fair. The world looks gorgeous, the level design i found to be a little short of genius. The enemies the small and the big ones are all as menacing! My advice to any new players, is to be patient, grind for blood echoes to level up, learn the enemies movements and attacks, time your gunshots properly and you will feel like a god once your get the hang of things or when you defeat a difficult boss. All in all this is a great game. Good replay value = good value for your money. 9/10",9,2016-07-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Jellybean15,"Bloodborne is a fantastic example of how to take Dark Souls core mechanics and change them up enough to create something great and unique at the same time. Bloodborne may wear its inspirations on its sleeve, but it has taken those inspirations and turned them into a great game capable of standing on its own. When it comes to gameplay, Bloodborne is largely still dark souls at its core. You use the shoulder buttons to attack, you must carefully dodge enemy attacks, you lose any experience gained if you die, and you respawn at fixed locations in the game. However, Bloodborne takes these mechanics from Dark Souls and modifies them, giving Bloodborne is own unique feel. First, the speed in of Bloodborne’s combat has been turned up considerably from Dark Souls. You and the enemies both move much more quickly, which in turn supports fast and reactionary gameplay. The slow, deliberate dodge rolls of Dark Souls have been replaced with consecutive quick dodges that take up far less stamina, and any health lost can be regained for a few seconds by attacking your enemies. The act of learning how to be aggressive and cautious simultaneously is a little hard to wrap your head around, especially for gamers who are used to the purely cautious gameplay of Dark Souls. However, once Bloodborne’s combat clicks for you, it’s incredibly fun. Next are the weapons. While there are fewer total weapons in Bloodborne, each weapon comes with the ability to transform into something different with the press of a button. The Hunter Axe for example, is a simple one handed axe, which specializes in quick attacks with a narrow range, but can be transformed into a two handed axe capable of dealing slower and more powerful sweep attacks to help deal with crowds of enemies. Every weapon has the ability to change into something different, and in turn gives all weapons a variety of attacks and strategies. Bloodborne has also changed the way it handles critical attacks. Now labeled visceral attacks, the player is able to stun and follow up with a critical hit on nearly any enemy. This can be done by hitting enemies with charge attacks from behind, parrying enemy attacks with your pistol, or – in the case of bosses – doing a high amount of damage within a short amount of time. While I miss the backstabs of Dark Souls, this gameplay helps Bloodborne feel unique, while also paying homage to its inspirations. One of my favorite things about Bloodborne is the idea of the Hunter’s Dream, a hub world where you can level up, buy/sell items, upgrade weapons, and access your storage chest which contains any excess items you couldn’t fit in your inventory while out in the field. This storage also replenishes any items you lose upon death, meaning no items picked up in the field go to waste. Also, the act of summoning an ally into the world is no longer dependent on maintaining humanity. Instead, you use insight, a limited resource used to summon allies into the world. While I like this (especially considering I had more insight than I could get rid of), it would’ve been nice if Dark Souls did a better job properly explaining how this mechanic works. Of course, like every Souls game, Bloodborne is not without its slip ups. Bloodborne prides itself on being hard, but it isn’t always done well. One particular level midway through Bloodborne sticks out due to its cheap and unfair design. Enemies are purposely spawned behind you with no warning, leading to many cheap attacks/deaths and many moments of rage. Luckily, there is only one level in the whole game like this, and it doesn’t manage to take away from the experience. However, what does take away from the experience are the issues plaguing Bloodborne in its entirety. The camera has always been a weak point in the souls games, but in Bloodborne, the increase in speed has only made the problem worse. With Bloodborne’s focus on fast speed, the camera often moves erratically, which can confuse you or even cause you to dodge in the wrong direction when the camera suddenly turns. The camera also manages to get caught behind objects on a semi regular basis, often obscuring your view. However, this wasn’t a problem I found to be a common cause of death. If anything, it just made the tension higher. Overall, Bloodborne is a fun, rewarding experience for anyone looking for a good challenge. However, its change in speed is something Souls players might have trouble wrapping their heads around, while simultaneously making it appeal to players who aren’t particularly fond of the Souls series’ slow movements. Overall, Bloodborne manages to succeed in copying mechanics while changing them up enough to make the experience feel different and fun in its own right.",9,2016-07-07,PLAYSTATION 4,user

There are far less weapons and builds in the game than dark souls but I feel each weapon has unique move-sets and fun to use. I beat the game over 10 times with different builds and still play it here and there. I do feel the main game could be longer and the pvp could be done better, but the changes in the combat are so good to overcome the game's shortages. on the other side, this game has my most hated boss in all the souls game, fxxk u Micolash with your spamming magic and everything involved in this boss design. Still love this game!!!!",9,2016-06-28,PLAYSTATION 4,user
nosebeagle,"i know, I wasn't a fan of the Souls games, so what am I doing playing Bloodbourne. I have been a gamer since youth and I love gaming. I guess when a game gets a lot of acclaim I have to give it a try. The game is awesome looking. I can't say the camera angles have improved much in gaming as there are still weird angles making some boss battles more difficult than they should be. I will say now that I will most likely not finish the game despite the great story and epic goth scenery. I am giving it a 7 due to, no shock here, the inability to adjust difficulty. You either live video games or you use them as brief escapes from an otherwise busy life. If you have a job and a wife or girlfriend, you likely don't have time to devote to games like this as the difficulty level requires many many hours of gameplay in order to ""git gud"". It is obviously the preference of the game designer, but I think the old school approach of having an easy mode that is truly easy is a way to make your game more accessible to the middle-age gamer that is limited on time. I know I would love this game if I could just relax with it for an hour a day and get into the groovy graphics and storyline, but since that is not an option I feel that I can not truly enjoy the experience. Like I said, the decision to add easy mode is up to the developer, however I would think From would want to sell as many copies as possible and I know many casual gamers who won't touch Souls or this due to the extreme difficulty. I know fans of the game say that From is staying strong for not adding an easy mode, but is that really true? If you want to get your booty kicked, then you will choose normal mode and let the booty-kicking begin. At any rate, I love the game. I watch videos of the gameplay just to enjoy the story and killer graphics. however, a 7 is where I am parking the rating. I did not like the Souls games, and this is enough of a departure from them to have me interested. I never really felt into the story of the Souls games - which I also did not finish for reasons listed above. This game is different. It is easy to see why it is receiving such acclaim.",7,2016-06-26,PLAYSTATION 4,user

mybrainhurts,"45-year-old gamer here who has never played a Souls game. I see a lot of reviews on how this game is only for Souls fans with lots of time on their hands, and I was hesitant to try Bloodborne due to difficulty warnings. Regardless, I gave it a go. It is up there with Journey as my favorite game I've played. It is difficult, but by no means impossible. You do have to be willing to explore and learn about the items you pick up. Numerous times, I called on someone to help - whether finding the summoning lantern for AI or using the bell, mostly when I was just stuck on a certain boss. However, no matter how frustrating a boss would become, the reward of defeating it (even with help) was unlike the feeling of any other game. I also searched youtube for quick advice and strategy on particularly challenging bosses. When all was said and done, I wanted to replay it again immediately, and take on some of the bosses I used help with on my own. As many reviews have said, you have to be up for a challenge when you play this game. If you like to speed run a game or choose difficulty levels, this game isn't for you. However, if this old guy can do it, so can you. It took me months to play (family man), but I loved ever second of this beautiful f*cked-up world.",10,2016-06-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user

hugotokok,"What a beautiful ""monster"" this is. Probably the best video game in recent years (one of the best ever). Bloodborne keeps and slightly evolves the excellent and proven game play concepts of ""Souls games"", while with its settings, visual concept and sophisticated, intriguing story finally nails it completely, making it the bets From Software offering to date. Again the real winner here is that lovecraftian-macabre-gothic-horror visual concept, that suits ""souls-like game"" the most, easily surpassing the dark-fantasy concept of ""Dark/Demon Souls"" series.

glypheye,"I year late, and this casual gamer finally found his huevos and decided to launch headlong into the creative conception of FromSoftware's notoriously difficult handiwork. I then spent the next several hours riding the line suspended between frustration and fascination. The only thing that kept me from tossing in the towel was reports of finding that threshold across which the scales tip and progress through this marvelously crafted gothic world gains momentum. I found **** crossed **** am glad I pushed my poor little ADD-impaired attention span long enough to discover the ""why"" of how beloved this game is to those already familiar with the magic of the Dark Souls series. I embraced the repetitive **** absurd distances between ""check **** dismay of having one's carefully horded stash of blood echoes vanish time and again. The whole brutal process seems ""bone building"" in a way that's a new experience for this casual gamer.

GiantSwords,"Bloodborne is very, very close to being a perfect game. Fans of the Souls series get everything they wanted out of it and more, while newcomers to Fromsoft's work become instant fans. The boss, enemy and environment designs are nothing short of incredible, the combat is the best in any Fromsoft game, and the plot, although shrouded in mystery and available only to those willing to explore, is the most interesting and compelling I have seen in a long time. It is far from perfect, however. While some effects and areas are genuinely gorgeous, the attempt to create stark, foreboding environments often creates bland, grey areas that are easy to get completely lost in, especially considering the somewhat maze-like level design. Additionally, the blood vial healing system is massively inferior to the Dark Souls estus system. There is really no point in being able to purchase/farm healing items if the amount you can carry is capped, and so the lack of early-game healing items makes the beginning far more difficult than it needs to be. Much of the difficulty of the first boss stems from having to farm blood vials before every attempt, which isn't a factor of difficulty so much as frustration. Despite its flaws, Bloodborne is a true triumph, made especially impressive by its experimental nature. It, and its associated expansion, are worth every penny.",9,2016-05-18,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Lycria,"As being a new player in the ""Souls"" universe, i was somewhat intimidated by the difficulty i have heard time and time again, but needless to say as soon as i bought a PlayStation 4 I went out and got this game. If you are new to the series as I was, do not let it intimate you. It is a fantastic game that anyone who loves HP Lovecraft or difficult action games must try. I had played the game about a year after its release so i was unable to play with others much, but even so the single player story is fantastic...even if a bit cryptic. It seems to play homage to classic games such as Zelda and Castlevania where the game does not tell you everything and respects the player enough to figure it out with the clues provided. The Key is to speak to everyone and explore everywhere. The story is pretty good, though for myself i had to look to other sources (forums and wikis) to learn more about what was going on since stated above it is somewhat cryptic, but it is addicting. I wanted to know more about all of the characters, both the good and the bad (evil). The gameplay is what makes this game great. It is very precise and accurate. You cant spam your attacks here because if you hit your attack 3 times, you will be attacking 3 times. You need to take things slow and analyze the situation. Enemies have attack patterns and have windows for you to attack them. Watch them and learn there moves and soon you will be a legendary hunter! Some of the few issues with the game id say is the camera for one. Its fine most of the time, but some of the faster bosses will zoom by you and you will lose them quickly just for them to run you over a moment later. Another issues is some of the areas (especially places with multiple enemies in one area) will test the limits of your PS4. Framerate dips and chugging moments make things difficult if you are trying to stay alive. Another slow point for me personally was the chalice dungeons. They reused some bosses from the base game and really didn't add much for me. I only went through them for the trophy. Overall it is a fantastic game that should be picked up if you have a PS4, its in my opinion one of the reasons to own a PS4. 9/10",9,2016-05-16,PLAYSTATION 4,user

You will feel no better sense of accomplishment then when you complete this game in full. I wouldn't recommend this game for anyone that is reliant on save systems to get them through games; as this game as very few checkpoints and some areas are particularly brutal to get through.

Depending on your overall tastes as a player, it will either aggravate you or make you feel more challenged (personally, i got invested more). Definitely, the best game of 2015.

I played about 10-15 hours, got even a couple of bosses down. Then I could not find the way to progress further. Lost about 1-2 hours of my time trying to find the right way and re spawning. Then it became uninteresting and frustrating (Like what the hell am I doing here? Why did I even spend money on this? Why am I not playing anything else? Is there any indicator of what I should do? Why didn't I watch a video of it before i bought it?) Anyhow, there is no story (only trash and junk hidden in some items), Game sounds very stale, graphics and scenery feel harsh (animated stuff that is a little far away is pixelated) I can't understand the many positive reviews.

A new parry system is also implemented no more shields here you have the option to use a gun and shooting your enemy right before an attack stuns them allowing you to do a parry visceral attack. Trick weapons are also introduced meaning the weapon has 2 forms take the blade of mercy one small sword that can be turned into 2 deadly fast daggers very quickly or the chikage a normal katana at first but coat it in your own blood and with the sacrifice of a small health loss over time strengthens the weapon and adds range.

While I will finish the game eventually I'm actually more interested in just starting over again. The difficulty of the game is quite fair. It's not an easy game that you'll just blow through, but it's also no where near as hard as what it's made out to be. If you can pick this game up on sale for $20 or less, don't hesitate.

mrwarcriminal,"WOW WHAT AN AMAZING GAME!!! Everything about this game is addictive, fun, exciting and frustrating. OH MY GOD it will undoubtedly piss you off several times however when you finally get past ""that point"" its sheer exhilaration. Ill start by saying I have NEVER played a Souls game and really dont like or give them much of a chance or even an opportunity. Dont remember if I've watched a Souls advertisement. There was something about the Bloodborne atmosphere/look that made me pay attention. I bought the game in Feb 2016 & started playing shortly after. The first two hours was very confusing. The first several hours was soul crushing (my soul). Regardless, it was fun and I had bought The Old Hunters DLC with a discount code so i wasnt going to throw money away by giving up. And that was **** GIVIN' UP. If you're interested in the game you'll gonna have to do some work to ""get it"". Ive been playing games since the late 70's and I can play whatever's put in the system. So my pride was hurt after repeated ""YOU DIED"" splashed on the screen over & over & over & over & over etc. etc. etc. The game is worth learning how to play. Its not gonna take the typical 20 to 60 minutes to figure out. After i had passed the first three bosses i began to get better and in-grove with the play-style. This point was roughly 10 hours into the game; i know it seems like a long time but that time frame isnt unreasonable. The game gives you no real direction or instruction. So as you discover (sometimes by accident which is perfectly fine), realize or look-up (dont do unless you're stuck for at least an hour otherwise you're cheating yourself) where to go, how to use an item whom to speak with or tactics in boss fights; these things are a natural gaming high you seldom find in any other game. Bloodborne is a gorgeous, dangerous, frustrating, rewarding, large, high replay-value game that will quickly let you know if you're not paying attention. Not for a light hearted play secession.",10,2016-04-21,PLAYSTATION 4,user
TheOneWinged,"Normally I don't do this, but Bloodborne is a game that deserves to get reviewed. First of all, I never played any of the previous installments by myself, but I heard and read much about them. One of the reasons I write this review is because lots of people tend to review games like BB very superficial, which is a shame because these type of games need a lot of attention and dedication to fully understand and to therefore enjoy them; like you propably heard before: this game isn't ment for 'casuals', both on a difficulty level and on an intellectual level. I've played 300 hours of PvE, but never did PvP, so please keep that in mind. It NEEDS to be said that BB is more a spiritual sequel to Demons Souls then Dark Souls, as lots of people are pretending wrongly in their reviews, as it has more concepts familiar with the ones of Demons Souls (Hub area, visual style, fewer weapons) then Dark Souls'. But without further ado, let's begin this Review: (1) [Story/Lore: 10/10] At first it seems like there is no story in BB, but that is wrong. In the Souls series, everything is part **** story, or lore, as it is called; from observing the locations in the game carefully, reading item descriptions to NPC dialogue; it's like a complex mosaic that needs to be put together, but when you do, you will experience one of the most breathtaking, well thought and mind-blowing stories the medium video game has to offer, as BB perfected this art of unconventional story telling and exceeded the previous installments in this manner by being more like a book you're not able to read every sentence of; therefore you start filling up the gaps with your own imagination. (2) [World: 10/10] Much like in Dark Souls, you will discover parts of the world which connect late-game areas to early-game areas, creating a believable and connected world. The atmosphere of the game is so dense and powerful that you will be **** in the world of Yharnam as soon as you enter it. In addition you will be surprised by the variety of locations the developers put into the game, unlike others pretend in their reviews: at the beginning it has a gothic look with many cathedrals but the further you progress, the more different locations you will encounter, from an abandoned village to rotted Woods, an university, a snowy castle into finally entering horrific nightmares. (3)[Characters: 10/10] An often unappreciated quality of BB. From the doll, other hunters like Eileen and Djura, the townsfolk you can interact with, to Master Wilhem and Laurence to even some of the bosses like Father Gascoigne, Micolash and Gehrman every character has an own little tragic tale to tell and every one of them has been crafted masterfully and feels unique and very different from each other. And on top of that, every one has other ways to deal with the doomed state of Yharnam and differ in philosophy; it's just like in Majora's Mask, where you can feel the hopelessness and dispair of each individual character differently. (4)[Graphics: 7/10] Solid graphics, nothing spectacular, it's a console-exclusive game. Although people were complaining about framerate issues and long loading times at release, patches took care of these things by now. BB suffers from chromatic aberration, that's an effect where the colors outside of the display-centre get blurred and rainbow-like, it's not a big thing but while there are some people having a problem with it, I never realized it myself and in a weird way, I think it fits the game, as it makes the game more 'dream-like'. (5)[Visual style/Music: 10/10] The developers lovely designed every nook and cranny with almost obsessive detail. The victorian look and feel pared with the twisted nightmarish influences of lovecraftian-gothic-horror make Yharnam one of the most, if not THE most refined, polished and unique video game world ever created imo, in contrary to the world design of Dark Souls, which follows a 'scheme A' of a medieval/fantasy/'Lord of the Rings'-style world design. If you are into Horror and/or Castlevania or Dracula, this is the game for you. There isn't much music in Souls games which sort of adds to the lonelyness/dispair themes but the music that is in the game fits in perfectly. Some of the tracks like 'The First Hunter' and 'Moonlit Melody' are some of the most memorable and beautiful pieces of music in all of gaming. (5)[Gameplay/Controls: 10/10] BB is much more aggressive then previous installments, getting rid of the shield completely, replacing it with a handgun. It's almost like Miyazaki made fun out of his older Souls games, leaving hints in the game like the description of the wooden shield mentioning how ineffective it is to turtle behind shields. The fighting now more feels like dancing with your foes: it is just beautiful, well balanced but unforgiving. Although BB doesn't have as many weapons as DS, it doesn't have to: there is at least one weapon of every archetype, and they are much, much more complex.",9,2016-04-20,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Trubills,"Bloodborne is a polarizing game, owed to it's relationship with Dark Souls (a notoriously hard franchise). I have not yet played any of the Dark Souls titles (yet), so my review can serve to enlighten those who are approaching Bloodborne with no knowledge or experience. This game can be beaten with any combination of weapons, armor, etc. that you choose to use. The more you choose to find out, the easier it may become, but it is not a requirement. I beat the game primarily using a weapon I received at the start. This eliminates the grindy nature of RPGs where new equipment is required to tackle later enemies. Progress depends on how cautious and opportunistic you are as a player. The game rewards those who learn from their mistakes and cautiously engage their enemies. Mistakes are punished severely. This is the key to appreciating this game: when the consequences matter, each move you make comes with tension and uncertainty. This is what makes Bloodborne fun and terrifying: your deaths actually come with consequence, as opposed to an irrelevant blip in your gaming experience. If found myself slowly exploring new areas, fearful of the horrors I might find myself confronting. Likewise, combat can be thought of as true to the spirit of the game. When faced with vicious beasts, one must be fast and hit hard in order to dispatch monsters that would otherwise tear you apart. The thrill of being caught off-guard by previously unmet enemies makes combat frantic and instinctual, necessitating a careful balance of ruthlessness and cunning. The learning curve is steep. Some may be put off by the prospect of repeated failure, however, this risk is integral to tying significance to each and every fight. Anyone who has played this game understands this- think of any time when you were as low on health along with the boss you've lost multiple times to, how you felt when they were SO CLOSE to being bested, how great it felt to land the finishing blow before being struck down yourself. This tension is rarely created in today's dumbed-down videogame landscape and makes for a rare experience. Likewise, the plot of the game is not given for you. Many players take for granted the story ****, letting it be bottlefed to them without investing any effort in figuring out the story for themselves. This mindset would make this game disjarring, and is why you see many reviewers claiming there is ""no story"". There is as much story as you try to discover- if you put in zero effort, you will be rewarded with zero information. However, once you figure out a little of what is going on the game blossoms into a nightmarish horror of fantasy and intrigue. This is the only game I've come across where I've spent multiple hours of my free time trying to learn the lore and mysteries of Yharnam. On it's face this is a game about slaying werewolves, but the reality is much more insidious, should you gain enough ""insight"". A collection of nonsensical events becomes interwoven into a mythos much deeper and darker than anyone would imagine. This game is not perfect, as no game is. However, this is absolutely a title that cannot be missed. It is one that players will be reminiscing about 10 years down the road, and is a true classic worth buying.",9,2016-04-17,PLAYSTATION 4,user

lamashu,"Gran juego, lo conoci por primera ves de la mano de mi hermano cuya idea de comprarlo fue suya, y en base a verlo jugar me empezo a atraer su estetica gotica y lugubre, su dificultad elevada y el reto que propone (no eres rambo, empiezas en el fondo de la cadena alimenticia), la banda sonoro y los ruidos aterradores y los EPICOS jefasos. Luego al jugarlo afianse estos sentimientos y me encontre con otros como el que aqui no eres bueno por tus items, sino la habilidad adquirida luego de tanto morir, te sientes orgulloso con eso, acompañado de una gran rejugablidad como son desbloquear los 3 finales y completar todos los calizes. Por que no 10?, algunos aspectos graficos (tirones y bugs molestos que me en ocasiones me costaron la vida) y el hecho de no entender la historia, sin lugar a duda no comparto para nada la idea de mantener en secreto la trama (genial)del juego, por lo que hay que verla por youtube u otro lugar.

R4v3n0iD,"Es un juego esencial en el catalogo de cualquier poseedor de una ps4 incluso para aquellos poco experimentados en la saga Soul. En este juego se a optado por una nueva mecánica de juego que nos invita a movernos mas rápido y actuar mas ferozmente, lo cual marca una nueva forma de jugar que bien afectaría incluso en Dark Souls 3. A diferencia de sus hermanos, el grupo de Hidetaka Miyasaki (el genio detrás de esta entrega) a optado por contar su Lore de una manera diferente a las otras entregas, utilizando el entorno mas que contenido textual, esto genera mas inmercion en el jugador, lo cual te integra mas en la historia y te invita a desentrañar esta misma. Ademas incluye una perfecta ambientación Gótica Victoriana, que hace sentirnos indefensos y pequeños gracias a las grandes estructuras y la oscuridad que hay detrás de ellas, si a esto le adicionamos los horribles monstruos y sus intimidables jefes, las calles de Yharnam se tornan turbias y terriblemente desesperantes para aquellos inmersos en el juego, metiéndote en la piel de un cazador que quiere salir de esa pesadilla a toda costa. A pesar de estos aspectos innovadores Bloodborne no es perfecto y muchos están de acuerdo que pudo haber sido mas, como por ejemplo: haber tenido mas variedad de armas y armadura (aunque con el dlc The Old Hunters se aumentan estos), mas longevidad en su duración (también aumentado en su dlc xD) y una mayor calidad gráfica que pudo aumentar aun mas su inmercion en el jugador. Pero el mayor error cometido por este juego es ser uno mas en la saga Soul, pudo haber sido una nueva IP pero optaron por hacer un juego con animaciones y perspectivas recicladas de las anteriores entregas de la saga Soul, pudo haber marcado tendencia y haber creado su propia saga pero... Bueno es gran juego y se nota el amor y empeño que pusieron en este. Por ello le doy un 9 ¡Buen trabajo From Software!",9,2016-04-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user

yoyo321,"Buenas, el Bloodborne me parece un gran juego, no es un simple hack and slash, es muy importante saber cuando golpear y cuando esquivar. Si vas apretando botones sin sentido te matarán enseguida. Al principio se hace algo difícil, tanto por la exigencia del combate como por el poco nivel que tenemos y no podemos subirlo hasta que avancemos lo suficiente. Pero una vez que pasamos esa primera barrera, ya no se hace tan difícil o mejor dicho tan imposible como parece en un principio. Luego el truco esta en ir subiendo de nivel poco a poco para vencer a los enemigos que antes no podías. Si te gustan los juegos con un toque de dificultad y que cuando te maten no aparezcas 2 pasos atrás, te lo recomiendo, pero si te desesperas a la primera de cambio, este no es tu juego.

Some people claim the game is hard, but is not. The little bit of story the game has, makes no sense and I hate the sometimes you are next to a wall or something similar and an enemy can hit you, but you can't. The hit detection can be iffy.

HamboneReviews,"Bloodborne is a masterpiece **** and I believe it is the current best game on the PS4. The combat in this game is unmatched by any other game and once you get the hang of it it turns from slow and steady tapping to fast and furious decimation. The setting is beautiful and mysterious and there are times where you just have to stop to look around you, even if it ends in you getting a sneak attack from behind. The monsters are wonderfully designed and the Bosses take that to the next level. The music is wonderful and sets the mood for even the most tense battles. Chalice dungeons add more difficult content to a game that is already supposed to be hard and are quite fun to run through, seeing more enemies than what the main game offers including some very nasty bosses. Bloodborne is a game that I recommend anyone try even if the genre is not for you.",10,2016-04-12,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Hack,"Bloodborne is a self harm simulator from the sadistic **** that created Dark Souls and Demon Souls, it's unlike any game I've ever played before and it's by far the hardest. It was so hard at points I honestly didn't think I'd finish it, and I nearly gave up entirely on more than one occasion but I'm so glad I didn't. There's a decent difficulty curve throughout the game although a couple of the bosses were noticeably harder than the rest. You do have the option to farm and ""out level"" bosses though so if you do find yourself stuck and at the point of wanting to quit you can farm for an hour or two and make the fight a little easier. The game does fall short technically though, with the worst frame pacing I've experienced so far which makes the game feel choppy throughout, you can watch Digital Foundry explain this issue on YouTube. The game will also freeze at times when the frame rate tanks, this is less common but happens enough that I feel I should mention it. By the end of the game I didn't feel the choppiness as much although it was still there, I had just gotten somewhat used to it. On the positive side the graphics are nice and the art style is brilliant, and there's a huge array of mob types which all look fantastic. The audio does a great job of making the game very creepy and atmospheric as well. Should you play this game? Yes, if you have patience and don't mind dying over and over. It's definitely not for everyone and I think you have to hate yourself a little to finish it but it's an enjoyable journey if you make it to the end",8,2016-04-11,PLAYSTATION 4,user

yepes,"I was so amazed by how quick I got addicted to this game when I initially got it. It was all thanks to a friend that used to share play with me. This was my first Souls game, and I really enjoyed every second of this game. What I loved the most about Bloodborne were the terrifying, unrelenting and incredibly difficult boss encounters. Imagine trying to slay 3-4 hours the same boss, and when you finally defeat him, there's no better feeling in this universe after you see the ""Prey Slaughtered"" pop up, that's what defines a From Software game. After I beat every boss on NG+6 (including DLC bosses), I realised how big this game was, and how fast I gained skill. I personally feel satisfied with myself after I did all the holy chalices, and defeating every single boss in the game on the hardest difficulty. Not to mention the epic PvP battles that maintains the replay value alive. This game deserves more than 10. Hats off, Miyazaki-san.",10,2016-04-11,PLAYSTATION 4,user

minion12,"First let me say that I am a complete novice to Souls games and before starting to play Bloodborne I had absolutely no experience with this kind of games. My purchase of this game was mainly influenced/caused by gameplays, that I watched on youtube. So I had an idea about what I was getting myself into and I was curious, if I would be able to face the challenge. I have to say that beginning of the game was extremely frustrating for someone like me, as I had to learn the hard way how to handle my character. I kept dieing in maybe 10 first locations without being able to proceed any further. Every mistake I made due to my lack of skill was punished heavily and I had to start all over again from the beginning. I have to admire From Software for their clever level design. Each boss has something specific to teach you (the hard way), so that you could proceed further in the game. Especially the second boss Father Gascoine is extremely frustrating and beating him requires to obtain specific skill. On the other hand beating such boss(es) is balanced with great reawarding feeling. I deeply disagree with negative reviewers who say that Bloodborne is extremely difficult and unfair game. Bloodborne only punishes players for their own mistakes such as lack of caution, overconfidence or lack of game skill. As for me I have to say that 99% of my deaths were caused by my own mistakes. When you overcome frustration of first several (for me it was about 8) hours, you will find yourselves enjoying the game immensely. I have currently beaten about maybe third of the game and I find it to be an immersive and reawarding experience. Before buying the game, I would recommend you to watch some walkthroughs to get an idea of what lies ahead of you. Remember this game give you NOTHING for free.",9,2016-04-08,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Mamal,"Pros: +The game world and the lore +Level design +Variety in weapons and armor +Exploration feels rewarding +Enemy variety +Epic boss fights +Superb presentation +Soundtrack +Chalice dungeons +It's big and it doesn't feel like a grind +Unpredictable in many ways Cons: -Camera and locking system can still get in your way -No class variety which reduces the replay value. You can invest either in Arcane or Bloodlinge skills but even those don't make the builds feel that different at all. -Only a handful of quests -Some quests and tasks are vague, you get little to no hints and you might miss them very easily. -Quests pretty much have the same results in most cases. Conclusion: I had an absolute blast playing this game and it has been the only captivating exclusive title I have played on the PS4 so far.

starburns,"Bloodborne is an incredible re-imagining of the souls series. So long are the days of tanking behind a massive shield and and poking the enemy with your weapon. The new combat style revitalizes the genre and makes players take the play-style they came to know and master, and throw it out the window for a newer sleeker design. At first glance this could make a few gamers mad, but this isn't dark souls and no one ever said it was. The art design and landscape of this game are marvels on their own and only give the game that much more individuality from the souls series. The Victorian era theme mixed with the dystopian setting blend together for an environment that we haven't seen before in a souls game. To partner with this Victorian theme, the garb worn by the hunters of Yarnham works perfectly with the speed and swiftness of the combat. If you were one to hide behind a shield like Havel's great-shield or Artorias' great-shield like i did in past games, then you're in for it when you first turn this game on. The sheer veracity of the enemy NPC's and the unforgiving nature of any souls game mixed with a lack of shield options and heavy armor means that tanking is not an option, so you better learn to adapt quick, or the world of Yarnham may just swallow you whole. Although Bloodborne does not have near as many weapon options as its predecessors, all the weapons feel unique in there own way and have a new feature introduced that none of its seniors have, which is weapon transformation. Weapon transformation makes that one handed axe into a much larger two handed great-axe, at the cost of your ability to parry with your side arm. This risk vs. reward combat style is a fresh new re-imagining to the souls series that knocks the ball out of the park. All in all, I have platinumed this game and have beaten it 7 times, as i have all the previous souls games, and i can say without a doubt that bloodborne is just as good, if not better, than any of the games that have come before it, except dark souls of course, nothing will ever beat that. =)",10,2016-04-01,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Zidane_Mina,"Do not approach this game in a casual fashion. You are going to die, a lot. But with each failure, comes the experience: eventually you shall slaugther whichever prey you rise your blade against. Bloodborne is branded with the now worldwide famous ""Souls Hard"" kind of gameplay, but this time the combat is fast paced and the game pushes the player to be agresive instead of hiding behind a shield. Make no fear, for the inclussion of fire arms did not turn the game into a 3rd person shooter, as some feared, for the uses of fire arms are well accounted and cannot be spammed, and given their damage output they're more fit for counteratacks than direct weapons. Level design is exquisite, and so the bosses and characters. Adrenaline will rise during the 50-60 hours gameplay, and the Soundtrack during boss fights will add to the pressure and epicness. Visually, the game looks stunning, with an artstyle that remembers victorian era London, medieval architecture, Lovecraftian mythos and horror themed enviroments. Bloodborne is an unique experience, and a complete one at it, with huge amount of content and secrets to keep you hooked even after the credits roll. And now, there's a DLC out there, wich further expands an already deep game. Give Bloodborne a try, and please do not dispair, for not many people think it's a walk in the park.

On the surface, there werent as many 'classes' to choose from in comparison to other soul games, but once you get into the game you can focus on arcane to add a bit of magic. Combat is a refreshing twist to typical souls game. You need to be more aggresive here and the game rewards you for doing so, but not to the point where you have to button smash. Visually, the game looks great. Locations are varied enough. Game design gets full marks, exploring locations is rewarding, and pvp is good fun.

Zen-Zinxe,"Bloodborne is a nightmare that never ends. It's very different from Dark Souls, the spiritual predecessor. In Dark Souls there's a large focus on loot and character builds. In Bloodborne your success depends not quite so much on your build, but more upon your skill. It plays like Dark Souls, basically the same formula, except it's almost more pure. What I mean by that is that the game focuses on the basics of hack n slash combat and making that have more depth. While Dark Souls 2 in particular had a ton of content and weapons and spells, weapons follow an archetype moveset and there aren't that many truly 'unique' weapons. Bloodborne is the opposite. It is a fairly short game with some of the content that is easily overlooked if you are casually playing through. In Bloodborne there are no weapons that aren't unique. There are some that are similar, but every weapon you can use has its own unique moveset that has more complexity than Dark Souls ever had. Bloodborne has way less magic than Dark Souls and it does not work the same, the game wants you to make a build centered around a weapon and a firearm/secondary weapon. Magic is a supplementary after thought to make things more interesting, not the focus of a characters build. In a certain sense Bloodborne feels more limited in almost every way than it's predecessor at a glance, but there is a truly impressive depth to the weapons in the game which shifts the focus away from loot, and more on your skill with the weapons. While it is difficult at first, it becomes much less unforgiving when you begin to understand the nature of the game and how everything works. Bloodborne is a journey into madness, a dark beastly nightmare, a test of patience and skill. Behold, a Paleblood sky! Make Contact.",9,2016-03-13,PLAYSTATION 4,user

THE MUSIC is by far one of the best soundtracks that I've ever heard in a video game.

leaveit,"It's like Dark Souls, but set in Die andere Seite by Alfred Kubin, the parry mechanics make no logical sense even from a game design standpoint, there's practically no blocking anymore, and the entire thing takes place in some mixture of the Undead Burg and Anor Londo. Everyone is talking about blood, which is to say souls, insight, which is to say humanity, and beasts, which is to say hollows, all the time. This is the unspoken fourth game in the Souls series, and it would be an exaggeration to say that the series has ever learned any lessons from its past. The combat is more or less identical to Souls games of the past, with a few caveats. Turtling is no longer an option so everyone is rolling everywhere all the time, especially since there is an expendable (i.e. less renewable than stamina) resource used to parry. The armor is all essentially worthless and doesn't contribute significantly to poise or resists, much like in Dark Souls 2. There is dual wielding, but your offhand weapon actually has less functionality than a shield, so this is a step backward resulting in ""timing battles"" of either roll-slashing or standing slightly out of every single character's swing radius, moving forward 1 millimeter, and then attacking, rinse wash repeat, or else actually using the parry system which revolves around trial-and-error exploration of every attack animation in the game, because it is only at a certain point that a bullet to the face will actually stun someone, and that point is when they are 1 inch from hitting you. ""Just like real life."" Other than this the combat is straight out of last decade, playing something like God of War but where you can only take a hit or two before being presented with a 45 second load screen and then retreading your steps like every Souls game. The setting is lauded by fans as being deep and unique but in fact is just Dark Souls in an, ""oops we dabbled with magic now ancient gods are dreaming a hell world for us"" setting, not unlike various other popular titles like Dragon Age or Grim Dawn, both of which had releases numerous years before this game even began development. The fans will call the setting ""Lovecraftian"" as a buzz word, even though the concept of elder and forgotten gods feeding off of human existence predates Lovecraft (for example People of the Pit, published 1918), and they probably haven't read any Lovecraft to begin with. I guess it's supposed to be a favorable change to the more traditional sword-and-sorcery appearance of Demon's Souls and Dark Souls, but this is at least the 10th game I've played chronologically that is set in a Steampunk Victorian-esque setting (most of the Castlevania series, Final Fantasy 6, Thief series, Amnesia, Dishonored, Grim Dawn, off the top of my head) and the 6th game featuring Lovecraftian monsters (Alone in the Dark, Quake, Eternal Darkness, Call of Cthulhu, Grim Dawn), so it's not exactly the path least tread for me. Even Pathways Into Darkness by Bungie features a ""dreaming god"" aspect without resorting to story elements reminiscent of all of the developer's other games. Not impressed. Multiplayer is no surprise, and operates almost precisely as it always has in these games. Fans will talk about how PvP isn't played up as much in this game, even though it's practically the same thing as always, just with fewer griefers coming in and ruining your game for you. In my opinion this is something of an improvement, though I still prefer hitch-free co-op and not performing arcane rituals inside and outside of the game to have any semblance of multiplayer. I have awarded this game 5 points to represent the utter banality and mediocrity I perceive; the re-use almost verbatim of all gameplay mechanics from the Souls series to date, the extensive art assets without inventing anything, and various technical annoyances - wildly varying framerates, connectivity problems, long load times - endemic to the series that have not and probably never will be resolved.",5,2016-03-09,PLAYSTATION 4,user

VagueShape,"A good game, but a bit light on the itemization and playstyle customization options. This installment plays much more like a pure action game that offers light RPG elements. A bit disappointing since one of the biggest draws to this series was how customizable your character was in past installments. People came up with some very interesting builds. Now its just a lot of gun parrying, even the final(sort of) boss can easily be gun parried to death and in fact its the best strategy to beat him. The atmosphere is immaculate and the general story is passable, but as with all Souls games it really doesn't have a strong narrative. Most of the accepted story is written by fans on wiki websites. The Chalice dungeon is a mundane excuse for end game. They make you play it some to get your platinum trophy but after you get that there isn't much reason to ever go into the chalices again. They aren't fun, or even interesting. Its the most basic and mediocre dungeon crawling awkwardly tacked on as ""end game.""",8,2016-02-25,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Ps4isawesome,"I have played dark souls but never completed it because it didn't click with me if you will. Although with bloodborne I had one of the most amazing experiences on the playstation platform. Knowing that this was a difficult game, I knew I was going to die.... a lot. This game gave me an extra urge to have the momentum to defeat a boss. It gave me satisfaction when I killed a boss and I completed the game, I felt joyed when I completed a ""Souls"" game for my first time. Not to mention the gothic style of the game which was beautifully crafted alongside the gameplay. Also the nightmarish creature models were an excellent touch to the game by giving the game a bizarre beauty behind it. Therefore Bloodborne, although with minor hiccups in frame rate and glitches it's a fantastic experience that gave me and will probably give u the satisfaction to complete the game, no game is perfect but certain ones like this get a 10/10 because of how enjoyable it is.",10,2016-02-18,PLAYSTATION 4,user

PainsMyName,"Bloodborne is an EXCELLENT game. I'm sure most of you just want a brief synopsis of whether or not this game is for you, so I'll try to keep it short. If you are an AVERAGE gamer this is a 10/10, easy. If you are an FPS only type of gamer this is most likely a 4/10 game. I personally think everyone should give Bloodborne a shot and try it. It's the type of game that makes you feel like you're on drugs or gives you that exciting, thrilling, Christmas feeling . This game has a rich environment filled with a variety of enemies to fight and a boss waiting for you at the end to kick their ass after getting your ass kicked a few times. This game also has rich customization. You are able to choose from a variety of weapons, all weapons are viable and can be upgraded, unique and stylish fancy armor pieces, more for fashion. This game also features character creation, which is honestly sloppy and requires a YouTube tutorial on how to make a lesser monstrous playable character. (It's possible to make a super hot female or male character for those of you that are wondering) Lastly there is a level up system in which you can rank up through killing enemies and choose which stat to improve between Health, Endurance, or Special Skills (Strength, Dexterity, Arcane etc.) to become more powerful. The only downside to this game are the Chalice Dungeons. (Optional Grindfest) The story leaves a lot of un-answered questions but is rich in lore. This game isn't hard, it just takes getting used to like any other game. All in all this is a very memorable game and a game I am very satisfied with.

fijiboy,"bloodborne is so good. If you are new to the souls series, this is the place to start. I tried playing darksouls about 2 years ago and quit early on. I am now currently playing dark souls and am almost at the end because after beating bloodborne I now how the confidence to beat dark souls. bloodborne isn't necessarily easier in all aspects, its just more accessible and more straightforward than darksouls, most of the things that frustrated me about dark souls were how getting from one place to another could be absolutely tedious cryptic. bloodborne on the other hand is much easier to traverse but still offers a challenge that feals a lot more fair. the combat is much different and is extremely well fleshed out but wether its better or not depends on your preference for either calculated or aggressive gameplay because the combat is much faster and aggressive in bloodborne. the art design is breathtaking in this game and looks a lot different than any of the other souls games and I think is a lot more creative not to say dark souls isn't a good looking game. I could talk along time about the great things about this game but to some it up, I couldn't find a flaw in this game besides wether or not the learning curb is worth struggling through for you personally to get into it.",10,2016-01-28,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Captain_Shorty,"Bloodborne is a fantastic game that contains immense detail, excellent lore/story, and some of the best combat systems and controls I have ever seen in my life. I was a Souls virgin until I got this game. I struggled very much when I was in the beginning of the game, as I could hardly get my bearings. If you are like me, then you will struggle very VERY much in the beginning, but just persevere and promise me that you will conquer the first two bosses, and after that, I am positive you will be in love. After hours of exploring, memorizing, practicing, and raging, I defeated the second boss, one of the best moments in my gaming life. See, since I have played Bloodborne, I bought Dark Souls Scholar of the First Sin, and it is certainly harder, but in Dark Souls there is a pattern: ""I hate this game, I hate this game, I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!"", whereas in Bloodborne, ""This is cool, this is cool, this boss is rough, this is AMAZING!!!"" See, even i Bloodborne is difficult, it makes you love it with its in depth characters, the environment, and overall level design and atmosphere. PROMISE ME YOU WILL BEAT THE FIRST TWO BOSSES!!! THEY WILL CHANGE YOU ENTIRE VIEW!!!! Now for the actual game review: Graphics: 9/10 When Bloodborne first released, it held frame rate issues and long loading screens. Now, the game is perfect. With great graphics, hardly any frame rate issues at all, and short loading screens! Design: 10/10 One of the greatest designed games I have ever seen! Better than The Last of Us and any Bioshock! Level layout and design is phenomenal, and the satisfaction of finding a shortcut is amazing! Everything is just perfect! Sound: 10/10 Sound contains great balancing, unique noises for each and every thing in the game. You will hear you characters heavy breath, and will shudder at the sound of blood being poured around a very nearby corner. Game play: 10/10 Controls are absolutely perfect, and the game play is smooth, quick, fast, and overall fast-paced action. I don' know how to describe it!!!! Overall Quality: 10/10 Bloodborne is perfect in nearly every way. With nearly 800 hours sunk into this hunk of pure awesomeness, I still don't know how to describe it. I am now all over its reddit, discovering lore theories and making lore theories, and always helping my fellow hunters hunt the beasts of the night. It holds an amazing base game with great storytelling and intense battles with enemies and bosses, in depth and very interesting chalice dungeons, great cooperative play, and decent pvp. It is a great game, open world with enemies everywhere, but if you get this game dear hunter, remember...a hunter is never alone.... psn :Cpt_Shorty528 (.......join me!!)",10,2016-01-26,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Viron,"This is difficult to review, because the recommendation is comes with a lot of caveats. It's like deciding whether or not to get your ass waxed, it comes down to preference. Okay, now to distance myself from that Metaphor a bit by explaining some of these caveats. The first is that if you like the Souls games (Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, etc) or games like them then you will probably enjoy this one, that is if you aren't married to the combat of those games. The other is that if you haven't played or heard of those games because you don't come on the internet much, or talk to people who pay attention to video games, you can still like this one as long as you have a tolerance for learning. Another is for those who aren't into reading or those who like they're story/plot/whatever info dumped on them in a ""As you know..."" speech, than you probably won't like this game. Really a lot of it just comes down to how much you want the GAME to hold your hand? Because for the most part it doesn't, after the first two bosses you are pretty much left to your own devices on how to deal with what is happening in the twisted world presented to you. Really I'm only going to talk on the gameplay because it's better not to give away too much of what is really going on by discussing the setting or the story. So if you've played a Souls game you sort of know how the baseline goes: You have a thing that does damage in your hands, you use it on bad guys to hit them to death, collect their juicy essence to buy things like level ups or items, and enemies hit hard and when you die you drop all of the essence you've collected on the ground. Even that last part isn't exactly the same, when you die an enemy in the vicinity may pick up your stuff and you have to go kill them to get it back. Now what is really different is the combat, gone are the days of rolling around in plate armor at the speed of a tortoise, NOW EVERYTHING IS FAST FAST FASTFASTFAST. Quick stepping through enemy combos is very necessary to become proficient at this game, so you can smack them while they are past you or cooling off from an attack. Aggression is key, there is no shield to protect you from hard hits, (there is a shield and as expected in a world with beastmen it doesn't really do **** if you take a hit you can rally off of that hit and regain the health back if you land enough hits, further encouraging you to be in the face of your opponent. With attack combos and weapons transformations, which transform the weapon into a different for that usually unlocks a different move set or more damage in some cases, you can find a weapon to suit your play style fairly easy. There are ranged weapons, along with ranged damage items, but they mostly serve as the parrying device for this game wherein you shoot just before the attack hits you leaving them open to a devastating attack. It is like a QTE, but without the button prompt and not necessary for success, though it does make the game easier if you just don't feel you can dodge well. The game will tell you these things and then make sure you know them as you reach the first mandatory boss, making sure you have a grasp on them before advancing further, the first optional boss will also teach you how to survey an opponent's weaknesses based on their appearance, such as which arm is dominant in attacking with a weapon so you know which direction to dodge. And if all of this is still to hard for you and you just want to coast along undisturbed by the bosses challenge you can always summon other players or NPCs that will help you till death of them, you, or the Area boss. That's all I feel like talking about that, the rest should be learned from playing the game. There is other stuff too that detracts from the fun, sometimes the game feels too easy, but if you just got done playing DaS 1&2 it probably would feel easy. The logic behind some of the enemy hunters is really stretched seeing as most have 6 times your health pool while still chunking you with a high health stat. But overall, great game would recommend. Hopefully the PC will get a release some day far in the future so more people can enjoy it.",9,2016-01-17,PLAYSTATION 4,user

It is too difficult to get through a short area in the game to have to start over from scratch every time you die, needs more save locations.

Darkly_Tranquil,"From Sortware and game director Hidetaka Miyazaki have delivered a masterclass in game design in the form of Bloodborne. This Lovecraftian gothic horror action RPG excels in every aspect of game design you could consider; from the gloomy foreboding aesthetic of its visual design; it's intricate interlocking level design that eventually grows into a single connected open world; to its tight, responsive, and brutally challenging combat; and it's haunting, melancholy soundtrack. All these elements combine to create a game that is incredibly atmospheric, while simultaneously being a joy to play. Visually Bloodborne is spectacular, with it's extraordinarily detailed environment design evoking a distinctly **** feel, and it's creatively grotesque menagerie of misshapen humans, beasts, and tentacled horrors are strikingly reminiscent of Doctor Jekyll & Mr. Hyde, Jack the Ripper, and H.P. Lovecraft. Of particular note is the skilful use of lighting and shadow effects, which cast the environments in gloomy shadows and pale moonlight, providing plenty of places for adversaries to lurk and keeping the player constantly on edge for an attack at all times. The soundtrack is just as effective, adding tension to the gameplay experience. The haunting classical and choral melodies that play in the background during exploration add to the atmosphere of escalating dread, then give way to bombastic orchestral scores during the climactic boss battles. But it's in the area of gameplay where Bloodborne truly shines. The combat system is fast paced, brutal, and unforgiving in its difficulty, but also elegant in its simplicity and responsiveness of its controls. Battles are hectic and demanding, with enemies often attacking from hidden locations or in packs, requiring fast reflexes and use of the environments to overcome them. Bosses offer a whole other level of challenge, with each featuring unique and powerful combat abilities that must be overcome. Effort, practice, and determination will be required to defeat them, as any mistake can be fatal. The only real criticisms I can level at the game are technical ones that are most likely the result of the limitations of the platform the game is running on. There are frequent frame rate drops throughout the game, but they are especially noticeable during hectic combat sequences with many characters onscreen, and when the game is trying to render panoramic views with long draw distances. The loads times are also rather long, even with the later patches, and as of patch 1.09, you can still expect to wait 25-30 seconds to load into areas, depending on their size and complexity. One can only imagine what Bloodborne would be like if it could be played on a high end PC that could do it justice where the PS4 clearly struggles. Having said all that, I feel that I should point out that Bloodborne is not for everyone. If you are easily frustrated by difficulty, or have an aversion to excessive blood, gore, and horror themes, this game is probably not for you. But if you are up for the challenge, Bloodborne is masterfully crafted game that should not be missed.",10,2016-01-07,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Catfish444,"I am a 45 year old lifelong gamer that has played games since Atari 2600. That being said, I was attracted to this game because of all the hype around Dark Souls and how difficult it was. Having never played Dark Souls, this was my first foray into the realm of hardcore console gaming. I loved this game! I did not find it so hard that it was unbeatable and I really enjoyed having to learn the strategies to beat each boss. I am currently on my second play through and still enjoying it. This game is tough and challenging which gave me a serious sense of accomplishment when I finally beat that boss I had been trying to defeat for days. I can see how the style isn't for everyone, especially for older gamers that do not want to spend the time required to master the game. It does take time. I currently have about 150 hours played into the game and that took me about six months playing when I had the time for it. I liked the fact that the main story was shrouded in mystery and even after finishing was left thinking ""WTF was all that about?"" I didn't give the game a 10 because of the multiplayer aspect.

(My favorite game) There is not another game out there that makes you feel as rewarded as bloodborne does. Towards the end of a boss fight, my heart is beating out of my chest and im at the edge of my seat. The gameplay and combat is truly phenomenal. The graphics and atmosphere are out of this world and made me want to explore every corner of the map. The music score is amazing and fitting to the dark atmosphere of the game. Many have said the story is nonexistent and that is one of the many things i actually love about this game. The story is allowed to be interpreted by the gamer. Throughout the game, i tried to figure out and hypthesize about what was going on. Who is the Cleric beast and whyd he turn into a beast? What turned these monsters into this? Why is Yarnham plagued by these beasts? There is a huge sense of wonderment and i love it. The only thing i could knock points off about this game is that the online is sketchy at best. However, i think the game is a better experience if played alone so i dont think i can dock points for that. Playing with another person in my opinion ruins the experience.

Greg2212,"This game have me hope for this industry, right when I was about to quit gaming entirely. Amongst all the Bethesda, Ubisoft, EA cancer, a From Software MASTERPIECE has risen. If one includes the Old Hunters DLC, this game simply cannot receive a different score than 9/10 or 10/10. The Atmosphere, animations, soundtrack, enemy design, pacing, story, world design, bettle system, are all absolutely amazing WHEN COMPARED to other games released today. This is the game to buy a PS4 for, this is the game that will be remembered 10 years from now - not Fallout, not Fifa, not that **** COD cancer, but this magnificent work of **** art.",10,2015-12-28,PLAYSTATION 4,user
ValheruBones,"Bloodborne is in truth, one of the best games I have ever had the pleasure of playing. It isn't a game for the faint at heart, or for someone expecting a game that holds their hand as they skip along trying not to break a nail - having said that, if the player is up for a challenge and fights the good fight long enough, it pays back your diligence in spades. It has been a very long time since a game has had me crawl out the other end of a brutal boss fight, heart pounding in my ears, and adrenaline coursing through me... only to exclaim ""I did it!!!"" as pride swells at the two simple words displayed on the screen pronounce....""Prey Slaughtered"". Truly a must have for any PS4 owner who wants to be a part of the consoles history.",10,2015-12-28,PLAYSTATION 4,user
iCSiMarcelinmBR,"Bloodborne is as glorious as it is grotesque, a harsh and unyielding exercise in getting battered mercilessly while feeling encouraged the whole painful way. While very much a Souls game through and through, the switch from methodical and slow progression to a faster, ultimately more savage environment provides just enough of a twist to give it a wholly unique feel, a more empowering journey, for both the player and the opposition. Bloodborne is something truly special – a barbaric horror RPG that will giveth and taketh away in perfect measure, wrapped up in a perverse world that will refuse to let you go!",10,2015-12-26,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Avengerx33,"Unfortunately I only read the positive reviews before I bought this game. Although it has some cool visuals the game play ****. First of all the control layout is horrible and there's no option to change it other than some axis reversal and camera options, but even the camera options don't allow for controlled viewing in play mode. The same button is used to lock on to a target and to reset view to forward, which makes some fight scenarios next to impossible to negotiate. Second, the responsiveness of the buttons is terrible. The directional button is overly sensitive while the attack buttons are sluggish. If you don't time an evasive hop perfectly, one hit from an enemy could render your next five attack button taps useless. Next, there is no direction to the story line or how to use items, features, and upgrades. After finally upgrading equipment several hours into the game, I noticed no changes in game play and continued with the same crap. Finally, there is no consistency. The final straw for me was when I figured out how many hits it took to kill a particular standard enemy, then came back and noticed it started taking almost twice as many hits to do the same thing.This was after some upgrades mind you. So I started a brand new game and noticed no more difficulty with a fresh character. Some say the game is too hard, but is it? I've been gaming since Atari 2600, and I have played many hard games on many platforms. When a game is hard, practice makes easier. With this game success is a strike of luck after long term repetition (Oh dear god the repetition!). If you like playing the same thing over and over without a clue as to what your goal is and seeing the same crap after painfully long reloads, then this game is for you. The people who gave this game great reviews should create a fund to reimburse the rest of us for our hard earned dollars. I would be embarrassed to give this piece of garbage to a friend.",1,2015-12-25,PLAYSTATION 4,user
jsands7,"Bloodborne is a solid 8 or 9/10; I'll round down in this case. My background with the developer is that I played Demons Souls but not either of the Dark Souls. Bloodborne is everything you've read and everything you'll expect. Sometimes a bit punishing but not the hardest thing I've ever played. I probably could have avoided some wrong turns and lost time if I had asked somebody or pulled up a guide but I wanted to experience it and figure it all out for myself. I did find that I had to grind a bit at times (or at least, decided that the risk/reward worked more in my favor if I stopped progressing and grinded). Some people would question the game design a smidge if they feel like the game requires/leads them to stop moving forward and grind. When I completed the game, I did an extra dungeon or two but decided I'd had just about enough of Bloodborne and I stopped. It is a solid experience but after the time it took for my initial campaign completion, I have no interest in playing the DLC or jumping back in.",8,2015-12-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Extremely challenging but it rewards you for your hard work 2. It's creepy as all hell 3. They tell you nothing. Seriously, nothing. Skipped three bosses on my first play though and got rare items on accident. 4. Leaves a lot to speculation which causes a lot of badass community theories 5. Every weapon morphs into another weapon which is awesome for having to change your fighting style on the fly. Amazing game! Must have!",10,2015-12-22,PLAYSTATION 4,user

dark_heart89,"Bloodborne is a step in the right direction for from soft. It offers an amazing atmosphere and a addiction to its lore and gameplay that will invade your dreams. The game is like a sword, while some swords are made off balance and will tire you out from poor craftsmanship, bloodborne is very well balanced and only gets better and improves the experience as you do. the main draw that will help you is the more fluid and down right amazing combat. It makes every hit feel weighted and that each hit matters between life and becoming the next monstrosities meal for the day. Im writing this review very late I know, but I wanted to take this year and really drink in the whole game and play through it multiple times to give anybody who reads this a fair and honest review on what this game is like. I wont lie this game will get frustrating and you will die many times, but please don't let that deter you from it. The game will feel overwhelming but believe me when I say this if you stay and persevere, you will see the difference in your playing ability and reflexes once you reach even the half way mark. You will see the accomplishments and feel successful, which is something almost no other game in todays market can give you. The enemies are some of the most disturbed, brilliant, and violently mutated creatures imaginable. The weapons all feel different and each have there own strength and weaknesses. People call this and souls games niches, I respect there opinion, but believe differently. I feel these games don't get the credit they deserve because people think there time sinks. Do these games take patience? Yes. The thing people don't understand is, that the patience is learned through playing the game and you don't even realize your getting it. The environment is so damn beautiful and at times you will catch yourself marveling at the scenery and even gazing out into the distance to see areas you have or can visit in the game. The world feels alive and actually interconnected. Then there's the story, I wont go into detail for spoiler reasons, but come on people what happened to imagination and actually working for our stories instead of hand holding. Bottom line is there is a very deep and rich lore in this game and if you take the little bit of time to read the items and be observant, believe me you will see the story and all the characters that are unfortunate enough to be stuck in the world with you unfold. I will go back to my statement about this game being a sword. Just look at like this. the fluid and almost dancing combat is the point of the sword. The creatures, music, and weapons are the balanced blade. Then the world itself and the lore in it is sturdy handle. When put together you have a masterpiece sword able to cut through the garbage of todays AAA gaming and breath new life into gaming and the underrated horror genre of video games.",10,2015-12-19,PLAYSTATION 4,user
PortalSMBX,"Bloodborne, created by FromSoftware, is beautiful, and dark. If your looking for a story that keeps you hooked you will find it here, however keep in mind that this is a FromSoftware game, you will actually have to look for the story and yes it is worth it. Game play is an important part of any game and it is perfect here. Every single button press, dodge, attack is all controlled by you, if you die, which you will a lot, its your fault. Its all on you to face new enemies, which have great variety, learn the enemies moves and adapt. Once again you will die a lot and after dying by a specific boss over and over and then defeating it is one of the best feelings in the world. The world is vibrant and filled with many different characters, which you can decide the fate for. Many sidelines can be completed and each offers a different take on what you do and how you do it. The world looks beautiful, especially when the fateful blood moon comes out. The game has a total of three endings, each completely different from one another. Their is also a great leveling up system with different attributes. Vitality for health, stamina for running time, skill for defense, attack and discovery, strength for attack power and speed, bloodtinge for gun damage and arcane for the different magic items you can find around the game. The game has a great variety of weapons each with their own combos and play styles and its fun to find new ones every singe time. The game has 13 bosses some optional, some not and many other bosses in chalice dungeons. Chalice dungeons are optional dungeons in which you make a chalice ritual which creates a dungeon which can be randomly generated or not. Three player coop is a big part of this game and is fun, every time you find a new area or fight and kill a boss, you obtain insight, using a beckoning bell can call upon random people or people with the same network password as you. Insight however also affect the game, after obtaining 10 insight the game gets harder and harder and harder so insight is a blessing yet also a curse. Weapons can be upgraded with many runes and certain shards you find around the world and runes can also give players a boost. Finally 4 factions exist in vanilla game and each one offers its own advantages in pve and **** all Bloodborne is a polished game that is cared by FromSoftware and is fun either single player or multiplayer.",10,2015-12-18,PLAYSTATION 4,user

3Potatoteers,"This is a very good game, if it was not made by FromSoftware, I will give it 8 or 9, but the more time I spent with it, the more I missed Dark Souls, the more I hate Bloodborne and the more I am worried about Dark Souls 3, it just makes me sad, because I know what I used to love has gone permanently. Now you all know how good the game is, I will just focus on the part I don't like. 1. Healing. Healing is fast and you have 20 blood vials at the beginning, and you can regain health for a short period of time after you get hit by fight back. It sounds cool at first, but soon I find the Dark Souls approach is superior. Why? First in Dark Souls you don't have to farm healing stuff when you get stuck, which is annoying and not fun at all; Second, in order to keep the difficulty of the game since you can heal fast, they either one shot you or gank you or attack non-stop like rampage, unlike Dark Souls where enemies are brutal but not crazy, and you have a shield to learn their attacks. The more you played Dark Souls, you get more confident, because enemies attack with a rhythm, you are rewarded by spending more time with the game, but in Bloodborne? The enemies are very hard to predict, and since you can regain, you can just trade with them with a strong weapon like Holy Blade. 2. Attire. Attires in Bloodborne are all about fashion and nothing else. They may have different stats, but really don't matter that much. There is nothing excitement about finding new attires in Bloodborne. Does it look ugly? Yes, then throw it away. This is so not RPG but FashionPG. 3. Weapon. Yeah I know lots of you love Bloodborne for the intricate weapon attacks, R1 combos, transforming attacks etc. But what is the best attack? Holy Blade charged R2. Hand Axe charged R2. Chikage transformed R1. Action game doesn't have to be intricate, it should be simple and elegant, it is more about timing and strategy, and know your enemies well. 4. Weapon upgrade. So little materials to upgrade the weapons. In Dark Souls you have alternatives like boss weapon, fire weapon, black knight weapon, dragon weapon. In Bloodborne? One blood rock per game, and no alternatives, that is...good. 5. Gem system. You wanna PvP? No you can't, because you don't have the best gems so they can one shot you with 50% V.attack and 3*27% gems. Go back and farm like a farmer! Thank you FromSoftware. 6. Chalice Dungeon. Could it be more boring? And instead of showing brilliant level design, they decide to deploy crazy hard enemies but no rewards for you, is that supposed to be funny and I supposed to admire that? 7. Cheap battle design. Most hunter NPCs have large health pool, they can heal, and they hit you with two or three hits, and they gank you. It is so cheap I just don't bother fighting with them. 8. Horrible camera. When you encounter a large enemy, man, the camera is **** you can only see its **** covering you monitor. 9. Poise. Anything staggers you. And you can't tell if an enemy has poise since there is no heavy armor in this game. So you better use Holy Blade charged R2... What is worse, when you get hit, even by a large boss, you are not knocked down, so you get some i-frame to reposition yourself, no you get staggered so they can combo you to death, and what is even more worse, you DON'T have i-frame when knocked down! It is annoying, I think they design it like this because of the fast healing. 10. Sound effect. Lots of bosses in this game roar or scream, they just ruin the boss music. It is torture to the ears. **** what is the point of making boss music when all you can hear is beast screaming? 11. Way too short NPC quest lines, some of them just ended. There is no one touches you deeply like Solaire. They are just too short. 12. Cheap boss fight. Boss fight should be hard, yet fast. When you die, you know you make a mistake, you know you can make it next time. There is nothing fun when you have to fight a boss for more than 10 min but make a small mistake and get one shot killed. There is nothing fun when you quickstep like crazy and drink blood vials like an alcoholic. Seriously, Bloodborne bosses have too much health and it takes too long to kill them, it just makes don't want to fight them twice. I fight Four Kings for god knows how many times and still enjoy it, but I will never fight defiled watchdog, defiled amygdala, or loran dark beast ever again. It seems to me FromSoftware is trying hard to create hard games instead of fun yet challenging games. They use RGN and crazy bosses to make the game longer to hide the fact that they don't have as much to offer as Dark Souls. The DLC for instance, the content is little yet the bosses are crazy, but you know what? People love it, they praise how beautiful the bosses are designed, but to me, it is just a prove they don't put much effort on lore and NPCs and new maps and cool level designs. They simply deploy some **** boss and people love it.",6,2015-12-06,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Merfy,"Bloodborne... I love this game it is spectacular, challenging, brutal and probably the hardest game I have ever played(Never played DS1 or DS2). I've put over 100 hours into the game at this point, the DLC was incredible and the chalice dungeons add a substantial amount of content towards the late game. The whole game looks amazing and the combat is very smooth, its also fair to say that I have witnessed some of the most vile creatures to ever grace gaming during my play-through, this game oozes originality its a masterpiece. However I can understand that it is not going to suit some people, it might just be the difficulty or the style of game itself, either way Bloodborne really blossoms if you dedicate yourself to getting better at it. Its easy to say **** this before beating the first two bosses but persevere and the game will start to shine. Overall I give this game a 9.5/10, the reason I take away half a point is because I would love to see a Hunters Arena in the game to allow PvP to reach its true potential(Ranked Play), also a similar setup for Co-op like a Hunters Hub/Social or something along those lines. Other very minor flaws were enemy placement not changing and I thought it would be so cool if From Software were able to incorporate dismemberment into the game for ultimate brutality. Had a great experience with Bloodborne, its one of the best games ever made and easily my 2015 Game of the Year.",10,2015-12-06,PLAYSTATION 4,user
CynicsGaming,"Reason I gave this a 10: To counter all of the unnecessary troll 0's this game doesn't deserve. REAL SCORE: 9.5 So I literally made a Metacritic account just to review this game and a couple of others. As I scroll down the user reviews, I see 0's being given by people with the sole reason that the game is too hard! What do you guys want!?!? You are the ones that are crying that games now are too casual yet a game that is difficult is released and people are giving it 0's just because you couldn't beat the first boss? Really? I got rekt by the first boss 17 times but I learned and this game rewards you for it! And this was my first time playing a FromSoftware game. The graphics are great. The amount of detail put into everything from a small puddle to an enemy is phenomenal. The gothic art style is a great welcomed change. With a naturally scary setting and horrifying creature designs, this game is easily one of the scariest games Ive played that isn't even considered a horror game. The story is vague and cryptic but for those who put the time in to piece it all together will be thoroughly satisfied. Weapon variation is great but I would say weapons like the Tonitrus are rather weak due to Arcane being a relatively weak stat. That's why I took .5 off. Stat balancing wasn't too great despite this being a RPG. Bloodtinge and Arcane are relatively worthless in the story and are only worth investing in if you play PvP a lot. A couple of bosses were easy to beat *cough* Witches of Hemwick* but bosses like the Blood Starved Beast are arguably some of the hardest bosses of all time. Constant defeat can be angering but Bloodborne is never unfair or has cheap enemies that can cheese you over. Every defeat was due to you not adapting to the enemy. I bought this game when it was released, and it has become one of my favorite RPG's of all time. Since Stat. Balance is key in an RPG though it did lose a point",10,2015-12-01,PLAYSTATION 4,user
SEAPIG5,"One word to sum up this game would be pointless...Granted I didn't play this game for long and people may say 'oh you just didn't give it enough time', however after a few hours of playing I want a game that grabs me from the start. Secondly people complain about games been too repetitive all the time and hate them for it but somehow this one is exempt from that point of view? No, not to me. That might be the aim too but I just don't get it. Finally, the enemy **** only thing in this game that strikes me as good design - that's purely the reason it doesn't have 0 - is the first boss (Don't know its name and wont waste any more time finding out). I mean at one point there was a giant flightless crows attacking me, where is the creativity in that? Speaking of creativity the lack of it is another way I'd describe this game.

YoJiEx,"Bloodborne is very misleading. You see stellar reviews from both users and critics which is totally rare. This lead me to purchase the game (digitally) which i soon regretted....immensely. It’s not the difficulty that got me though... First of all, I've never played Dark Souls so have no background on the story. If you're not a fan of the series or familiar with the story you will have a lot to catch-up on through online channels. The good news is this game is mostly loved so there are fantastic communities that will help you. Difficulty: I'm not afraid of hard games at all (I grew up on Megaman and Ninja Gaiden, among others). The game is challenging and grindy but also sort of forgiving; you don't seem to lose items when you revive and progress (other than enemies) will mostly stay the same from where you died. It's a HARD game, not for casuals, so just be aware. I like challenging games so this wasn't an issue for me. What I disliked: As soon as I started the game up, I noticed that the graphics were dark mostly pretty, however, it was not graphically impressive to me; it seemed rather dark and much of the environment, while shiny and having a nice gothic feel, seemed more like a set than an impressive 9+ score modern gen game. This is the first game on PS4 that I’ve played that I felt like I was playing a previous generation ported game. The character’s clothes, for example, are totally static. They don’t seem to move or interact like I would expect. Part of this is that Japanese game design style but to me it just feels like corners were cut. The second huge issue that I noticed immediately was when I started walking and heard the horrible pit-pat-pit-pat sound of the footsteps. These are generic PS1 sounding footsteps... I thought maybe it was just a joke and I would stop hearing it however it wasn't and soon that pit-pat was driving me nuts. This game looks and sounds like a last generation Resident Evil game. The story: I initially didn't know what was going on despite reading all of the clues in the game. There is an assumption of knowledge about the game that I missed. After reading online and clicking on absolutely everything, I finally figured out the very basics and was able to get my weapons and move forward. I fought and killed the first enemy and laughed out loud at how horrible the physics of this game are. You have got to be kidding me with this game! The enemies all die exactly the same way and then collapse into a blobby heep; like the enemies have jello for bones. Despite these frustrations, I pushed on with the game and soon ran into the challenges that I had heard about; the enemies soon are very difficult but that is doable with patience and practice, however, the horrible game design, audio, confusing story, and just ridiculous physics would not allow me to enjoy this game. I feel like this game masks it's generic features with high difficulty and an inside-joke-like story that I somehow never could understand or get into. What is worse is that this game is defended so venomously by fans that I feel that others would agree but have been silenced online. Had I been able to read the above concerns, I would never have purchased this game. If you enjoy the game then I’m super glad for you and wish you the best but if the above items give you pause, please rent the game before dropping good money on it (especially digital copies which you can’t trade in).",10,2015-11-30,PLAYSTATION 4,user

mtg837,"The good: Beautiful design, from beginning to end. The imaginatively macabre vision of victorian england never fails to amaze. crisp, exciting new gameplay. familiar enough to souls fans while bringing a new level of speed and excitement. terrifying, menacing bosses. the difficulty remains, too. some bosses decidedly more than others (in traditional souls fashion,) which will keep you on your toes till the very end. no game has cooler boss fights than the souls games, and bloodborne keeps this true to form. great atmospheric storytelling. you really feel like a lost explorer traversing the unknown. the world is totally yours to discover. the bad: not much. i had one or two camera angle issues, but those were few and far between, and to be expected with the pace of the action (dodging into tight corners will happen.) i always play the souls games in offline mode, and i'd like a pause function. the end (SPOILER) gives you the option to not fight the final boss. I didn't choose that, but I thought that was kind of lame. Who plays a game 99% through then decides not to fight the final boss? He's arguably the coolest boss, too.

RPGaymer,"I know a score of 5 doesn't go with the mainstream oppinion but hey - thats what user reviews are for. First of all I have to say that I am new to the dark souls games and Bloodborne is the first game of this series. Lets start out with what I like +++ The world and the setting is superb - that Lovecraft meets Walking Dead meets Groundhog Day creates a dense atmosphere, fantastic surroundings and an eerie feel to it. That was mostly the reason I kept playing this game for so long, it just feels great to travel the streets of Yarnam. ++ The narration - I love it. This game really makes you feel with your character as you are thrown into a weird scenario having no more of a clue than your character does, and the story isn't simply told, you have to uncover it, discovering little clues at every corner, forcing you to put the whole picture together yourself. Very interesting + The Enemies are fantastic, I dont know what the game creators were taking when they came up with those monsters, but it definitely worked. Those weird enemies really make the game worthwile But there are many negative points that finally made me quit playing this game, leaving me very dissapointed, as I would have loved to see more of the game. --- I am lost. I mean - I know that being lost is part of the game and part of the fun, but when it comes to a point where I either have to spend hours upon hours, trying to every combination of ""now I toppled a flower pot - now i have to visit everything again, maybe something changed somewhere"" or having to rely on wikis to spare me that waste of time this really is a buzz-kill for me. --- The difficulty. I spend hours roaming the the streets after the first lamp. The game doesnt tell you ""get one insight, find a skull, bash it against your head and you will be allowed to level up"" no. Either you stumble over it, or you dont and you cant even begin the game because of that. But once you got that figured out (thanks to wiki) there comes a time when it actually makes fun to play. Then the first bosses come. I know that it is part of the fun to learn the combat mechanics and I daresay I mastered them sufficently, putting a lot of time into it. I also managed to beat a lot of bosses and aways felt kinda proud afterwards because they really are tough SOBs. But at some point I met a boss that I couldn't beat at all. And I dont wanna spend another 10 hours farming previous areas, just to level up a little so I increase my chance to survive the first half of the bossfight. I just dont have the time for that. So after all: If you have time on your hands, if you can adapt to the playing style easily, and if you dont mind spending hours upon hours farming the same surroundings untill you can proceed and to train your use of game mechanics - buy that game. I am however finally sick ****, that in my opinion isn't playable without a wiki page. There are no explanations whatsoever, the game mechanics are complex and yet not explained at all and in the end I have to say: I paid good money for it. If i want to make this game easier - add easier difficulty levels - and leave the decision up to me!!! I am pretty certain the game will become very interesting later one, but that doesn't do me any good if I cant get there, withouth putting another 16 hours of mindless farming into it. Some people have a life in the real world, game difficulty should be adjustable to players who wanna see the whole game without having to spend hours upon hours in farming and training. With adjustable difficulty settings this game would have been a superb 10/10. The way it is it's just an unplayable piece of something that might have been great, but I'll never know. And a score of 5/10 is generous for a game that is so hard, it might as well be bugged or broken. When will software developers realize to give more power to the players. If i want the fights to be easier, add a darned difficulty slider, or live with this score. I couldn't recommend this game to anyone who has a real life, because it the ratio between ""it eats up your time"" and ""you actually proceed in this game"" is as unbalanced as it can be.",5,2015-11-26,PLAYSTATION 4,user
XxSoULxMaNxX,"What was I thinking?? My rating - until I just edited it - was slightly less than a 10 when, in fact, this is one of the best games available. The new DLC solidifies it. Also, I finally got into the chalice dungeons and building weapons for specific enemies / situations (i.e. a pure, fire saw for beasts, etc.) - the depth, combat mechanics, world, atmosphere, ambiance ....and on and on.

Makeshift2812,"I rarely consider a game to be a 10/10, but Bloodborne truly is a masterpiece. Every aspect of From Software's latest game is stunning - both visually and mechanically. The combat is fluid and satisfying, the graphics are beautiful, the multiplayer is both unique and enjoyable, the list goes on. The game's difficulty may be a turn off to people who are new to the franchise, but this was my first From Software game and I found the game both punishing and rewarding. So far I've sunk 80+ hours into Bloodborne and I plan to increase that with the release of The Old Hunters DLC. Bloodborne is, put simply, incredible in every way.

People see the comp[any which made dark souls and expect amazing, when the game comes everyone is in denial, they can't accept that it is bad. Although all the fans will be at me for hating, but hear me out. Positives: Large open world Large variety of enemies Difficult gameplay Imaginative enemies and bosses Good concept Negatives: Simple gameplay (dodge, shoot, hit, repeat) No story til later within the game (leaving people in the dark) A lot of backtracking (to unlock new areas, to level up, and to get items) Bad facial graphics (PS2 grade actually) A lot of the enemies follow the same pattern (slowly walk towards you, dash and hit) Bosses are difficult, but simple (very little variety in attacks) You get nothing from smashing things (although it is nice, it feels pointless) Some enemies are just too strong at your level (One hit kills, they are ranged and have lots of HP) Tutorial isn't very good (I found although I like short and sweet tutorials, the game didn't explain anything just said to do it) All in all if the gameplay and enemy attack variety was improved, then it would be an 8/10, but sadly it is just too repetitive and simple",3,2015-11-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Datamari,"This game is cruel! I like it! Bloodborne was developed by the same people who made Dark Souls, which is notorious for being one of the hardest games ever made. Bloodborne is no different, and while at first it may seem like a Dark Souls clone, it's more of a successor to the franchise. It's still punishing and savage, but still enjoyable in terms of combat and level design. The game looks great, the story is surprisingly deep, and the overall gameplay is what makes this game worth every death. the only problem I have with this game is that the frame-rate drops and loading screens can slow the pace, and the chalice dungeons seem a bit underwhelming. But despite these technical issues, Bloodborne still holds out as a fantastic experience, but if you're new to games like these, i'd recommend playing Dark Souls 1 or 2 before playing this. However, just a tip of advice before playing any of these games: be prepared to die. Bloodborne gets a 9/10.",9,2015-11-15,PLAYSTATION 4,user

A world that is a joy to explore and exploration like the Souls games is a must as in the usual case very little info is given to the gamer.

zmmby,"It's a fun game. It aint Dark Souls and you can tell by that. Gameplay was really good and my god, the art design of this game is just terrific. One of the best i've ever seen. However, i felt that spending so much Blood Vials on the boss fights, made me take the easy way. I dont have time to farm 10-20 vials everytime i try a new boss. That made me call for help on every boss since i didnt have time to try it on my own. I would prefer something like the Estus flask in DS. That was a huge letdown for me since i prefer a challenge. The story was kinda ""meh."" I explored everything about it and still thought it was abit confusing and lazy. Music is good and enemy design is awesome really. I think it's fun that they tried something new and i applaud it. Since you dont have much variety on the leveling classes and weapons. I didnt feel any urge to replay the game after i completed it. PVP is abit boring too since everybody just goes the glass-cannon build. In Dark Souls, i could go for 2h on the first run and mage on the 2nd run which was fun, but after i was done with this - It went on my bookshelf. Maybe ill play it again in 1 year or something.

The game is hard, I'll give you that, but it's only hard for hardness' sake. It only brings needless repetition, and if you enjoy grinding same boss over and over and over and over and ooooooover and over and over again, then maybe this is the best thing. This game is pretty much flappy birds (in more than one way), and it probably draws similar audience. The real RPG features are fairly non-existent, which actually makes this game more of a hack'n'slash à la Diablo . The unintuitive controls make it more of a hack'n'die, though.

Masterbaiter,"Bloodborne is one of 2015's greatest games. It is a must buy for fans of FromSoftware and old school horror. Create your own character and fight the plague of beasts to cleanse Yharnam. The ""story"" of this game is left up to the player to interpret. There is enough information hidden in texts and item description to form a cohesive narrative, but it is ultimately up to you to decide the purpose of your character and his/her place in the world. You will find a variety of weapon throughout your journey and you play primarily with arcane items, trick-weapons, and guns. Some people argue that Bloodborne is lacking in variety compared to its predecessors. That is not the case. Bloodborne's weapons vary greatly and can completely change your playstyle from long, mid, and to short range; certain weapons are better against certain enemies. The souls had more weapons but many were simply reskins of a base design. Here in bloodborne the playstyle of the scythe, greatsword, hammer, saw, and axe are all different. The monsters of Bloodborne are some of the most interesting you will see. Without spoiling too much, you will of course face the typical werewolf, but be warned they are but a common enemy and you will fight things that will make you question the game you are playing. All in all, this is a terrific game, and I highly suggest trying it even to those unfamiliar with the series.",10,2015-11-11,PLAYSTATION 4,user

AGiantDad,"There is only one way to play this game. Be fast and hit hard. While some people like that (myself included). There is NO good variation to this. Pros of bloodborne Looks great Combat is fast Not as hard as other games (i mean Dark Souls) Play as Joker Cons (where to start) *This game has no variation. As stated above, if you build like a tank, your gonna die like a **** This game will smack you around if you're slow. So you have to be fast and hit hard. Because if you think that hitting a boss more than 2 times is possible, go ahead and throw the game away. *Not even close to as hard. I'm a seasoned Darks Souls vet, *DeS included*, So when i first loaded this game I was hyped for the First next gen Souls-like to my knowledge. I should've taken those hypetrains and shot them in the yard and left them to die, because it would've been more merciful. ***** little My main grip is that it's WAY too easy. For once i had to stop playing a game like this because it was boring. The story isn't compelling, the combat (while faster) is dull, and it feels like i'm playing a game that wanted to be hard... but looked at mommy and decided that ""hard"" is a relative term. The only thing I look forward to (after getting halfway into the game) was seeing the doll, but that was because it was one of very few things I could stand. Give it a shot if your a souls fans, but don't buy it until you KNOW you like it.

What's there not to love about Bloodborne? Honestly, I could never get into the Souls because it never quite fit my play-style. It taught you that hiding behind a shield is always the best option. Bloodborne, on the other hand, puts you right into the action, and shows that shields are meaningless, by giving you the only shied in the game for free, and it's wooden. The minute I saw this, a big smile grew on my face. Easily my favorite parts of this game were the bosses. All 17 of them are a difficulty to fight, even the ones that didn't seem threatening at first, and difficulty is the name of this game. I expected so much from this game, and I received all of it and more. I honestly wish it would never end, because with all of the stuff there is to see and do, it seems like that would be a possibility. I can't wait for the DLC, and hopefully a sequel.

Bloodjack1707,"Bloodborne is AMAZING, I couldn't believe that it took me this long to try out this game. The first thing you will notice is this game is hard, I do like hard games but this was the most difficult game I've ever played. I've never tried dark souls or demon souls so I don't know if Bloodborne is easier or harder than these games, but know that you will die again and again and again... This is one of those games which the story is vague and if you want to understand it, you have to read the descriptions, the little hidden messages etc... It doesn't bother me at all but I do know some people don't like these types of games. The gameplay is awesome, the left hand is for the gun and the right hand is for swords, blades, axes etc... So you can do combos with them, the combat is aggressive, smooth and fun. But the best parts of the game are the bosses, when you fight one, they put epic music (btw the soundtrack is awesome) and they are hard to beat, so when you beat one it's SO freaking satisfying. But it's not for everybody, it can be frustrating so if you are not patient, this game will not be a good experience for you, the loading screens can be a bit too long and the camera maybe will be hard to get used to but other than that I've got nothing bad to say about this game it's my favourite game of the year.",10,2015-10-30,PLAYSTATION 4,user

BeardeDestroyer,"I am a huge fan of RPGs and most things dark and brooding. When I first saw the trailor for Bloodborne I was seriously intruiged but I didn't part with my $70 due to the lack of bow & arrow available to the user. I was unaware of the lack of other RPG elements at the time. For months I kept returning to the trailor because of the rave reviews afforded to the game, and it wasnt until recently that I finally gave in and took the plunge. I should state now that i'm not a Souls fan, purely because I hadnt been exposed to the brand before. I am, however, a serious gamer when real life can be put on hold. Here is my experience with Bloodborne: Bloodborne is not an RPG; rather it is a brutally frustrating 'hack n slash' that offers you very little reward/satisfaction/enjoyment. It is nigh on impossible to progress past Central Yharnam (5 mins into the game) unless you have the patience of a saint, largely due to the cruelly spread out checkpoints. The game is designed in such a way that you are likely to progress only through shear persistence and wasted time; you die, you respawn at the lamp (all progress is lost), you progress a little, you die, you respawn at the lamp (all progress is lost), you progress a little more, you die, you respawn at the lamp (all progress is lost) etc etc and all the enemies that youve killed previously are there once again as if nothing happened. I find this incredibly sad that one should be required to spend hours of their life repeating the same sequences with nothing to go on other than the stubborn notion of 'this game shall not beat me'. The terrible fighting sequences, annoying targeting system and inconvenient camera angles mean that any move could be your last, even if youve totally sussed out the area and have the perfect plan to beat it. Too bad, YOU DIED. Now go and repeat the last 30 minutes of your life and pray that misfortune doesnt befall you this time... Ive seen several reviews that have commented on this aspect of the game being 'cheap' and not 'challenging' as the developers had in mind. I wholeheartedly agree with this sentiment. The total game time is grosely exaggerated due to the inevitable rinse and repeat. Even if you leave Yharnam and return to the central hub (Hunter's Dream) to do a little trading, everything you achieved beyond your last checkpoint is wiped clean. I thought this style of gaming was canned in the good old days of the PS1! With regards to story you are given nothing. 'This town is possessed, kill it before it kills you' is what i've gleaned. Even writing this review I wish I could find out the sinister workings of Yharnam as alluded to in the blurb. I wish I could download a patch that says 'You know what weakling? Youre rubbish at this but thats OK. Here are some extra checkpoints to help you get your money's worth' because the game looks beautiful. Really, the canvas is wonderfully chilling. Even without the cheap deaths it would get your heart racing and put you on the edge of your seat, but fear of those cheap deaths is ultimately the emotion that takes over. This game should have been so much more. Verdict: 9/10 for the graphics and atmosphere, -7 for being so headbangingly, controllerhurlingly unplayable, -1 for being wrongly billed as an RPG. Overall: 1/10",1,2015-10-29,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Caelectric,"Spectacular setting, stunning atmosphere and highly absorbing game play. This was my introduction to From Software and 'Souls' games. I don't play all that many games and am certainly no expert but was able to cope with the difficulty level which was challenging and rewarding but was never impossible. I would recommend this to anyone. The starting area is definitely difficult and it takes a while to get used to having to overcome a challenge in order to make any progress at all. However by the time you find and open up that first shortcut or defeat that first boss you'll begin to think you're really making progress. As a tip to get started, running past enemies and coming back to them later, is quite a viable strategy so don't hesitate to do so if you come up against a brick wall! In summary for me this game was a revelation. I've never played anything like it before.

The game itself is beautiful in its simplicity, you have your attacks, and dodges similar to the dark soul series. Where the game really shines though, is in all the stuff the game doesnt outright say. The amount of story in this game is easily missed by those that rush through and mash the continue/skip button for cutscenes. They will finish the game, and feel empty in terms of story. IF you take the time to listen to the cutscenes, and read the notes, and really connect to the main characters, this story is 100% the best story ever told by a video game in my opinion. When I completed the game, I played through it again, then when i beat it a 2nd time, i played through it again, then i went through all the end game content which are called *chalice dungeons*. Each time you play, you get more connected to the environment, and learn just a tad bit more about the story you may have missed the first time. This game set the benchmark for every story game to follow from here on out in my eyes. If you're on the fence about buying this game, get it, and for all other hunters who may be reading this.. May the good blood guide you.",10,2015-10-22,PLAYSTATION 4,user
ThunderRam,"If you hated demons souls... then you'll love this game! :P But seriously, I tried to get into demon souls but it was very harsh with its difficulty and didnt seem fair in general and had clunky and non precise mechanics (IMO). Bloodbourne changed my mind and gave me hope about any future demon/dark souls games. I have never felt this many emotions in one game before: ""Stress, anxiety, happiness, awestruck, scared, excited, and many others"" and wanted to play more and more until I had to force myself to stop. For a really weird reason, I could compare this game to Zelda Orcarina of Time for the mysteries that you want to uncover and the adventures you are about to embark (I know, its a weird thought but other reviewers on youtube said the same thing so I dont feel bad saying it on here.) I've never had a game where I truly wanted to go online and research everything to know more about the items that I found, how to be better with my weapon/armor/stats, or strategies (that aren't cheating) that help you overcome obstacles that are pretty difficult in general. This is the best game on PS4 that I own and one the best games that I have played to date in regards to the atmosphere, location design, weapons, bosses, minions, lore, horror, etc. You MUST TRY THIS GAME - You might get addicted though.... :P P.S. If you are afraid of the ""Die and start over"" genre, dont be afraid of this game (I was VERY close not buying it because I heard it was from the same company), the ""checkpoints"" are placed in awesome areas that help with this.",10,2015-10-22,PLAYSTATION 4,user
rustybones16,"This game... play if you like having to be 100% accurate pressing the buttons and having the stick pointed in just the right direction. Any timing issue and you're dead, over and over and over. Play if you want little information about what to do next, replaying the same levels over and over while you grind up levels. There is no blocking, only dodging. Lots and lots of dodging. The Witcher 3 employed the same control scheme, and everyone agrees the movement and combat is clunky and buggy. The only redeeming quality is it looks good and is actually fun if you can progress. But seriously, don't bother.",2,2015-10-15,PLAYSTATION 4,user
AkumaShokan,"Amazing, amazing game. Coming from a hardcore dark souls HATER, Bloodborne was a pleasant surprise. The atmosphere, level design, boss battles, controls, and that feeling when you see ""prey slaughtered"" on **** name it. Everything just clicks perfectly. That being said, I still can't look at dark souls without disgust (don't kill me *runs for cover*). My point is, if you like dark souls battle but want it to be faster, and cannot stand the medieval setting, bloodborne is for you. P.S. if you are wondering why i hate dark souls, it's because of the appearance (castles and skeletons...really?), slow and passive combat, and the death penalty. It makes me depressed every time I try to play it.",10,2015-10-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Cruzi,"Having played through all Souls games I absolutely loved Bloodborne and the fresh and new experience it offered to a formula that is slowly getting stale. I never dig deep in the player-versus-player aspect of the Souls series and don't think I've ever summoned someone or got summoned by someone, I solely play the games as a single player game. The setting is superb and game play is refreshing compared to all the dumbed down sandbox games western devs seem to release these days. It's like Souls but a lot faster and hectic. The level design is the best we've seen so far, especially compared the the awful level design of Dark Souls II and it's mediocre bosses.

KaladinStorm,"I don't like rating anything 10/10, but I'll do it for now just so people can at least give this game a chance if they have a ps4 and the money for it. I didn't think I would enjoy this game. In fact, I considered selling after I bought it. Then I decided to give it a chance. And that was one of the best decisions I have ever made. Rarely has a game proven me so wrong. Rarely has a game caused me to make a 180 degree change in my opinion of it. Now don't get me wrong, Bloodborne isn't for everybody. It isn't your typical 'casual' game as you really have to put your mind and skills to the test here. What really captivated me was not just the gameplay (which is integral to every game) but the atmosphere. Bloodborne feels so unique, it is a whole new experience. I'm gonna stop here, words aren't getting the message through as thoroughly as I would like them to but still, want my opinion? Give Bloodborne a shot.",10,2015-09-29,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Having come from Dark Souls where a shield is your best friend, it took a bit of getting used to with this game leaving them out. Once I’d adjusted I had one heck **** time. It feels like a Souls games with enough differences to make it feel like something completely new. If you like your games tough but rewarding then you need to give this one a go. Definitely not for the impatient and easily frustrated.",10,2015-09-29,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Hoolaloopa,"The game is shorter than Dark Souls 2, however, it gave me roughly 35 hours of gameplay for the story and dungeons. Difficulty is on par with Dark Souls 1. Good level design and attractive graphics. Dodging dynamics, dual function weapons and power-up attacks make the combat interesting and a good parry system which is the most visceral I've seen in a game. A fair amount of variety in the enemies and their challenging placements are well thought out. Found the lore of Yharnham to be fascinating and very mysterious which added to the excellent atmosphere of the game. The player can only warp to locations from the Hunter's Dream (the central location), and not directly from one location to another, this is definitely a backward step from Dark Souls 2 warp mechanic. You have to purchase blood vials (health packs), a consequence of this was that I had grind for them in later parts of the game. Graphical pop up and glitches occur on occasion, with whole surface areas completely disappearing for a couple of seconds on the Forbidden Woods location. Frame rate drops considerably in co-op and lag is common. Limited types of armour and not many were better than the hunter amour that can be found early in the game as well as no option to upgrade them. This and the limited amount of weapons to choose from make the game feel rather shallow compared to the Dark Souls series. This game is unrelentingly tough, however, it does get you going back for more, a brilliant feat that From Software do so well in the Dark Souls series. Despite it's failings, Bloodborne is an addictive game and well worth a play through. If you love the Dark Souls series, you'll like this flawed gem.",8,2015-09-27,PLAYSTATION 4,user
GamergodsFail,"Bloodborne is possibly From Software's finest work yet. The combat is as solid as ever, and the atmosphere fits everything together perfectly. It could have been a little longer (story path is surprisingly short), it could have applied a bit more customization (such as upgrading armor) and the chalice dungeons, although 100% optional, do get repetitive fast.

heisenberg771,"I don't understand why so many people like this game... At first, I did not know it was another ""Dark Soulest"" game made by the same company, because if I knew, I would have stayed away. However, after the first few minutes, I figured out it was exactly the same type of game as Dark Souls, which I hated with a passion. I don't see the fun in spending 15 mins killing monsters everywhere, and then having to start over and over and over and over AND over again, from the start, with all the monsters respawned, just because I died once. Checkpoints are almost non-existent, and so far away from each other that you end up clearing the same mobs all the time. Graphics and movements are also quite cheesy. There are BUNCH of glitches and my character got stuck between carts a lot of the time. If you enjoyed Dark Souls, you will love this. If you hated Dark Souls, you will hate Bloodborne.",4,2015-09-18,PLAYSTATION 4,user
kyleb19,"Bloodborne might look a lot like Soul's games but it's not. Gameplay is not just faster, it's different. But it keeps the main aspect of Souls, Dying is major part of the game. Not just newcomers but veteran Souls players will die. Story. For people that got used to games that are holding your hands through the whole narration will think there is no story behind the game. But that is not correct, because all of the story aspects are told by the environments, monster design, weapon and item descriptions. Also there are NPC people that gives you a dialogue, a piece of a puzzle to the story for you to solve. Main plot is about a player waking up in Yharnam's clinic, becoming a hunter he must find and destroy 'Paleblood' to free the town from beast scourge. Clueless about what exactly is 'Paleblood' player steps into the streets of a city to slaughter every single beast in his way. There are multiple ways to find the truth from a lore that is hidden in the letters left throughout the game, item descriptions and game design. But it doesn't end here, There are also multiple storylines of the citizens of Yharnam who you can try to help to solve their problems. Gameplay. Very fast-paced and very smooth controls let's you dodge and counterattack instantly. You can carry up to 20 Blood Vials to restore your health and 20 Silver Bullets for ranged weapons. Bloodborne doesn't have magic, but has devices that work like magic and cost significant amount of bullets. When you get hit, you have a small window to hit back and return your lost health which forces you to play aggressive and less accurate, that leads to unnecessary deaths. You can have primary weapon and secondary weapon at the same time, but on top of that primary weapons have second form called 'trick' weapon. With a press of button L1 your weapon changes into a totally new weapon with new attacks and abilities. There are overall close to 30 primary weapons in the game and every single of them got L1 form, which doubles the variety. Secondary weapons are ranged weapons, torches and wooden shield which is absolutely worthless. If you use ranged weapon on a enemy right before he lands the hit, you will execute a parry, making enemy vulnerable. If you press R1, your character will pierce enemy's inners with bare hand, this move is called Visceral Attack, that deals enormous amount of damage. A normal farmer enemy can land a deadly strike, but the best part about Bloodborne are the BOSSES! Every boss has few stages it enters depending how much health it has, and every boss requires strategy and patience. One mistake after 20 minute long battle can result instant death and you have to start over. Think you are strong enough for new challenges? Chalice Dungeons, randomly generated tombs with 3 levels, where at the end of every level asides a new Boss you never seen before or a stronger version of the one you met before outside. This is the place where your body and mind are put to a test. Graphics. FromSoftware's Art deisgn Is the best in the industry, and the power of Playstation4 let's us to enjoy it with a high resolution and detailed environments. Cloaks, Capes, Dresses are gorgeous and works with physics. Particle effects in some areas gives depth into the level and it's just a great feeling to watch at them. When I first time got to the Great Bridge, a small wind blew small things/particles from the ground with dust and it's just beautiful. Sound. Hands down on of the best QUALITY sounds I ever heard, how your character steps on different landscapes, how wood cracks, how torch lit, how randomly a bell rings, how beast roars, how a dying beast moans, perfect sound design. Immersion everywhere, while you at one place and you hear something from the other side of city, you feel like you're there. Soundtrack that plays during boss battles, you have to experience it yourself, such a tone like you have no chance of beating it. My Verdict: This is a game that I am still thinking about to this day, it's a game that you can put disc in and play anytime you want. This game has little flaws but they don't matter at all, because content this game brings to you is so detailed and enormous, that $60 is a joke.",10,2015-09-18,PLAYSTATION 4,user

BeefThunderhorn,"Here is the quick and skinny of it, because who likes reading long rambling reviews? This game is perfect for a person who enjoys practice, patience, and reward. Run in like you know everything and the game will swat you down (see many of the frustrated poor reviews!). The idea is to watch, study and find the openings, try something, fail, know why you failed, and try again. This can be frustrating but because of that the reward when you do win is all the better. The story line isn't in your face, and this is what the game does well. You don't need someone to explain everything to you in a cut scene. Look around, take in the environment, read the notes and talk to people. You create your own idea of the world and wait for it to surprise you (no spoiler, but one enemy had me just standing back and observing it for 5 minutes because it caught me off guard and was amazing) If you're a COD type of person this game could frustrate you to no end. But if you're the type of person who is meticulous and likes to explore and learn on your own. This game can be very rewarding.

mrmustard,"Dark, very difficult, extremely frustrating at times and equally addictive. A real roller coaster ride of emotions to play this game. The beginning was definitely the hardest part of the game - simply because I was reluctant to read online guides for tips/advice and had no idea why I kept dying so much. I highly recommend it though, as you will discover a whole lot more content and enjoy the game much, much more. Never thought I'd find myself saying that, but (at least with this game) it's true. Bosses are hard, dying is frustrating as you lose all your 'currency' on death, and it can be a little grindy - so it really is a hardcore game and not a casual gaming experience. Be prepared to die a lot, memorize levels like in the good ol' days and feel really scared when you run into a boss. Great game, but certainly not for everybody",8,2015-09-05,PLAYSTATION 4,user

olrion,"I was new to the Dark Souls/Bloodborne realm when one of my mates introduced me to Bloodborne on the PS4 recently and I was immediately hooked. Hacking and slashing our way through the beautifully dark world, we passed the controller back and forth with every death, for hours. My first impressions were that the game-play was incredibly intense, exciting and surprisingly rewarding (despite being brutally mauled every few seconds) but sadly, as reality set in I soon found it to be simply too punishing for a casual gamer like me and the 'appeal' of dying became unnecessary. I understand that the unforgiving nature of the series is exactly what appeals to most gamers and its difficulty has become a signature of the series, but I would have liked to see a difficulty system implemented to give more casual gamers a chance to enjoy and finish the game. I've been a gamer for over 25 years and I still get the buzz when playing a new game. I will always try and beat games that I buy and enjoy, whilst being realistic about how much time I can dedicate to an age-old hobby. However, after being exposed to Bloodborne for several hours on a friends save - despite all it's potential and mystique - I couldn't see myself tormenting myself and playing through the entire game. Bloodborne is a great looking game, challenging and strangely addictive, but it's relentlessly difficulty left me grinding hours away only to be felled once again by an enemy that is seemingly impossible to beat. The enjoyment ceased when I found the only way to progress through relatively small sections of the game, was to repeatedly swipe at re-spawned enemies in order to level up and build up potions to navigate the evil lurking around the next corner. This process quickly becomes a fruitless pursuit of what I am sure is a rewarding climax, but the endless hours and patience required to beat the first boss, let alone the entire game, is just too much for a gamer with other pursuits, responsibilities (and a job) to tackle. Bloodborne and games like it will not change their formula over a few cries from casual gamers who 'don't get it', but I can't help but feel excluded from being given a fair chance of truly appreciating a title with great potential simply because the developers want to keep hold of the brand of gaming that makes their games unique. If players want a challenge that befits the Dark Souls mould then they would take it upon themselves to ramp up the difficulty to a level that suits them/challenges them and given the chance I would have done the opposite and lowered the bar a little so that I could appreciate Bloodborne in the way that a casual gamer should be able to. If you enjoy a story driven game that is aesthetically pleasing, dark, challenging and ultimately rewarding then Bloodborne will be right up your street. Be warned however, there will be evil lurking at the end of that street and it WILL kill you. A LOT!",7,2015-09-02,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Gwyndolin,"I think Bloodborne is a step forward to Souls series. The faster pace action did not betray its strategic action gameplay (where as games like Bayonetta, DMC, is twitch action gameplay). It follows the ""challenging, punishing, but never cheap"" motto of the series. What sets it apart from the older games aside from the faster gameplay is the lack of shield and its emphasis on counters. In the past, countering/parry/riposte was optional, in this game, it is almost a must to master this mechanic. I did feel the environment to be kind of monotone, but it was intended and majority of players loved the atmosphere. I loved it too but I do miss the occasional serenity and melancholy feels Dark Souls gave off (Anor Londo for example).",10,2015-09-01,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Asura,"Bloodborne is a new Action RPG from FromSoftware, the creators of Kings field, Armored Core, and of course, the souls (Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2) franchise. Bloodborne is very similar to the latter in terms of gameplay, yet at the same time, very different in terms of atmosphere. What truly makes Bloodborne great is its characterization of NPC's, Story and atmosphere, and gameplay. Characters: The many different characters you meet throughout the game are all different, yet there is an underlying theme of eventual decent into madness and tragedy, driven by the plague that infects the town of Yarhnam. From the old crone you save from a beastie died dog in front of her house, to a justifiably paranoid man, all of them have some sort of sadness to them. Story: Taking in the infected town of Yarhnam, the story starts with you, the player character, trying to find a special Paleblood, reffered to as the Blood of the gods, to free you of sickness, only to get into the mess that caused Yarhnam's plague. While seemingly a modern take on classic Gothic Horror like Bram Stoker's Dracula, the game p's story truly takes a turn for Cosmic horror by the games second half, showing that the horror that plagues Yarhnam is far worse then imaginable. Atmosphere: The game truly nails a gothic atmosphere similar to old Gothic horror novels like the above mentioned Bram Stoker's Dracula, and it shows in the games Victorian era architecture featured fpthroughout the games world, especially in the snow covered Castle Cainhurst. The game truly takes a turn for cosmic horror angle, however, after the Byrgenworth college area. Gameplay: The game plays similar to From Software's previous souls games, but as opposed to relying on shields,mused to block and turtle your opponents to wait for a counterattack, Bloodborne emphasizes on speed and dodging, manuvering around your opponent and attacking relentlessly, using a handgun to counter and enemies attack, with relatively limited ammo at a time. Bloodborne is a game that truly shows all of From software's strengths as a developer, from tight gameplay, to beautiful atmosphere and minimalistic storytelling, it is a game that shows that From Software will be around as developer for a long time to come, and they continue to improve with every game, while providing a much needed challenge in an era of relatively easy games.",10,2015-09-01,PLAYSTATION 4,user

deettis,"Even though Bloodborne is not part of the Souls series, It is so closely related to it that you have to compare it to both DS and DS2. Bloodborne isn't bad by any means, but it feels like a stripped and Simplified Souls game to me. Maybe this is because they wanted it to be even more accessible to major audiences (PS4 marketing). The game is beautiful, but its just boring without Souls series like character progression and weapon/armor choises and upgrade paths. You start with an axe and a sunday jacket and you might very well finish the game wearing that very same gear. If you add this to the fact that NG+ doesn't have any interesting changes, there's really no reason to play the game twice. If you think this game deserves 10 points, I really suggest you play DS/DS2. Especially DS is a pure masterpiece.",7,2015-08-28,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Completely recommended for the people who liked Demon Souls or Dark Souls.",10,2015-08-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Yajuu,"The PS4 exclusive to get. It has incredible atmosphere, combat, level design, enemy design. This game is an absolute masterpiece. If you are a Souls fan BUY IT. If you are not.. BUY IT.",10,2015-08-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Tuz0,"Except for the bad accessible Handling/Controls, THIS is the best PS4 EXCLUSIVE title yet. The game has a dark, uncomfortable athmosphere throughout the game. Literally Everything except the Handling/Controls is perfect. Well if there isn't the ridiculously high difficulty.... However this game weeds out the faint-hearted and all casual-gamers without remorse. So if you ever consider purchasing this game you should know what kind of gamer you are before buying it ;P The story is very abstract and dark, so don't expect a plot from a mainstream hollywood film. For some people it may look like this game has no storyline at all and may seem like poorly directed and designed game. But if there is one sure thing is that the background story is surprisingly deep, but only if players are willing to read, a lot. Every item in this game has a lore which gives you more insight about the game. If someone wants to describe this game in a proverb then it would be: 'There is more than meets the eye'. There are so many optional or secret passages, items and even most of the bosses are optional which are easily missable. This game is mysterious, dark and doesn't forgive any mistakes, so any daring player should man up. We are born of the blood, made men by the blood, undone by the blood. Our eyes are yet to open...Fear the old blood.",10,2015-08-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user
TheTwizle,"This game is not for everyone! That said I understand the draw of it to the ""hardcore"" gamer. I am not a hardcore gamer and the draw for me was the story on the box. I did not enjoy the difficulty and lack of a difficulty setting for someone with more of a casual taste who would like to enjoy the game. I did not like the ""tutorial"" in the beginning of the game. I felt there was a huge lack of direction in how to play and where to go that left me feeling lost and frustrated right from the start. Like I said the game is not for everyone!",4,2015-08-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user

SDMF,"Don't get the wrong idea,this is a really good title,Myazaki and his team did a cool job,but c'mon,why so many high scores in those reviews? It's one of the most overrated games I have ever played. This will be a somewhat long review,so you will need some patience Before listing the pros and cons I found while playing the game until its final moments of the true ending i'll tell my experience. I really dedicated myself to this game,I searched everything in the wiki,I'm kind of a RPG maniac,I got Demon's Souls three months after it was released looking for a really interesting RPG on Ps3 that would hold me like good old titles since NES and Ps1 did. And like I did in all the Soul Games I wasted a lot of time of my life looking into the game mechanics and infos about builds,armors,weapons,stats and all those stuffs. And while looking into the wiki I realized that I found the first problem: I finished my build in more or less 2 **** that a good thing? Maybe. Of course it's nice I don't need to spend 1000+ hours in a game until I finally create my true desired build(like happened in Dark Souls 2,holy **** From,wtf is your problem putting 9999999999 equipments in a game? I really wished that Dark Souls 1 could have some more equipments,but it was just too extreme in Dark Souls 2 with all those useless millions swords and greatswords and few twinblades/curved greatswords/greatbows/fists/whips...a middle term between the two games would make it nice,but anyway...) But then I realized that finishing my build in two hours was bad and not good,because there wasn't too much things to see,to search,to look into it...because the game lacks diversity! IN EVERY **** WAY, making fun and the variety of builds really limited and everybody using the same weapons in 90% of the time. And this ****, because this is something that can't happen in a **** game is more of a hack 'n slash than a RPG.They didn't polish the details of the game.Everything is so simple,so superficial,so ""we will not work too much in these features,so let's just say to them we wanted to keep it simple,so they don't have too much to worry and this will be fun"" IT IS FUN,but after some time it's just repetitive. *******Cons: -Very few stats,only six. -Very small number of weapons,even with it's trick mechanic -Very small number of secondary weapons -Very small number of equipments -A lot of equipments are variations of the default hunter armor -Only true difference between armors is it's appearance,the changes in the stats are minimal,and so you can't really change the damage that you take,if you want to survive more hits the only way is investing in your HP or levelling. -Where are the rings that all of us RPG fans love? The few Runes were a great improvement but it would be nice to have both runes and rings,each one with its own utilities or at least more Runes. -Very small number of ""magics"" -Talking about magic,why the **** does magic uses QSB? You can only carry 20 QSB without Odeon Runes, and you need to use a lot of them for the magics, and ALL secondary weapons uses it too,so you basically use magic one or two times before you run low of **** you want to use both magic and secondary weapons you're screwed. -Only one form of defending yourself from attacks: evading.There's no shields,no protective magics the name of this game should be ""attack&evade"" because it's just about that or trying to parry with your gun,but the system for parry isn't the same to all enemies and some can't even be parried(even hack and slash games have more ways of defending yourself apart of evading ,for example guarding,counter or instant counter),and because of that comes the main con: -The game is very repetitive,from the beginning to the end it's just the same gameplay,with some little improvements that are so small that it don't feel interesting at all,it becomes lame, being saved basically by the boss encounters. -Few npc's.This wouldn't be a problem if they at least had some use or role in the game but 95% of them are absolute useless,or are in the game just to teach you some **** tutors,very few merchants(only the two at Hunter's Dream),very few quest lines and rewards. -Enemy NPC Hunters are ridiculous powerful,they have infinite bullets and they will spam their magics and secondary weapons making direct combat with them kind of inviable and unbalanced,and it's even worse if there's more than one,you need to use bugs or map limits that they don't transpass because when they come near this map limit they turnback to their original spot with the AI combat absolutely messed up and ignoring your existence(they just walk away giving their back for you to hit them hard) -History is kind poor,it isn't all bad,but again,it's too simple. -Chalice Dungeons / Random Dungeons are boring as hell, I don't know who had that idea but it don't work,at least not for ****'s pretty boring to stay in a dungeon that every floor and room looks almost the same as others,doing the same **** over and over **** all the strongest items and runes are in there,so it's kind sad... -No secrets, no hidden walls,almost nothing to look or search for,almost no discovery. -It's not fun to replay it at all,it's repetitive even in the first playtrough(there was a point I nearly stopped playing because I was bored,but i was at 70% of the game so I keep up),I can't imagine how boring it can be in a NG+ doing the same things over and over again one more time. -Too few covenants -True Ending and last battle was kind of disappointing,kind of ""...it's just that?"". -Because of all of this the PvP is boring Ok after this speech and saying just bad things,comes the Pros: *******Pros: -Pretty cool graphics -Hard and challenging maps,I dare to say it's harder then the Souls Games in some aspects -One of the best atmospheres I ever saw in a game,it's really really nice you know? It's darker and heavier than any Souls Game with it's ""gothic-postapocalyptical-madness-world"" elements and It makes you feel immersed and sometimes tense of what comes next,scared of losing your 100,000 Blood Echos in a map that enemies can appear out of the blue basically from everywhere,and if you're not on your guard: ****. -Excellent soundtrack -Really cool and well designed enemies -Boss battles are freaking awesome,the cutscenes are nice,they are cool looking,gruesome,ugly,strong,fast,they scream and makes you piss your pants when they are raged and all the Boss Themes only make it better! -Beautiful armors and equipments -Cool looking Weapons,every weapon has a unique and nice moveset -Trick system of the weapons are one of the coolest and interesting inovations i ever saw,the combos you can make with them are satisfying -Well designed maps -Interesting Blood Gem Feature -Interesting Rune Feature -Creative and cool magics And that's **** game basically takes one step foward and two back... I always dreamed about something like the runes and the blood gems feature on a Souls Game,and more intimidating bosses(the majority of dark Souls 2 bosses are a joke) and an atmosphere more ""Dark Age"" to make you feel like you were on a Tolkien LotR's book(Demons Souls was the one that got closest to this Medieval Dark Age Fantasy atmosphere in my opinion) and when a game does have something like these **** lacks A LOT in other elements... It's a nice game,but ****'s not a top tier game...",7,2015-08-20,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Probably it becomes more interesting with time but I do not have that patience because I have many other things to do too with my day.

Went through this game using and leveling all weapons in the game, unlike using only one or two in the other Souls type games, so those who claim theres not enough weapons are wrong. I used more weapons in one playthrough of this one game than I did in all characters I played in Demon Souls, Dark Souls, and Dark Souls two combined.

t0mmyg,"Bloodborne finally won me over to the souls series in a huge way. It's a third person action game that just oozes character at every turn. The level design is a work of sprawling genius and although jarringly difficult at times, the world implores you to come back and give it a 30th try. I can't get over how absolutely gorgeous this game looks on a big television, the art design is spectacular. Yes, you will get frustrated with this game. Yes you will feel at times like giving up. But stick with it and you will be rewarded! I think the main thing that drew me into Bloodborne vs. other Dark souls games was the fast paced nature of the combat.

Bossuk,"This game has some positives and negatives, but I'm most disapponnted that Miyazaki has not changed the bits that needed changed from the souls series and most importantly left in the bits that should be left in:- Pros:- - Trick weapons, giving one weapon 2 playstyles - Atmosphere - as always with Souls games, the atmosphere is very good. - Challenging opponents - at least until you learn their patterns - Fast paced action - as the game encourages offensive play, it all happens quick. Negatives:- - Boss styles - they all look different but for the most the tactics to kill are identical. Get behind them swing/dodge/swing or Shoot/Counter/Visceral. Rinse and repeat these 2 styles and that's all bosses done. A couple of variations, but for the most that's it. - Lack of weapon choice - to take one weapon and just give you 3 variations on a theme is just lame. and the variations are not enough to call them different. Bsically you get 3 * the same weapon - Guns - Pretty much these have one use. Stunning. They do little damage, and have no use but to initiate visceral attacks. This means you can leave a gun at level one and play the entire game. The only gun that does decent dame is the cannon and you only get 3 shots before you run out of ammo. - Armor - Pretty much all the same with some small variatons. but for the most the only reason to change your amour is fashion sense. - Chalice Dungeons - An interesting idea, but overall do not fit in with the game at all. My issue with Chalice Dungeons are, you need to do them in order to get the good runes/gems. but the high level dungeons give so much Blood(Souls) that in one visit to a high level dungoen you will earn more blood than you will in the entire game. This means that before I had even started NG+, I was lvl 200+, making the difficulty of NG+ useless. In souls games after you had finished the games, you either pvp'd or went NG+. instead I felt the subsequent playthroughs were trivial. So either you let yourself lose millions of blood or you spend it. PVP - my biggest issue with this game. During my first playthrough I was invaded only once. And even when I tried to invade it took ages. There are no PvP hubs, no summon glyphs, nowhere to go. I fancy some PvP, I'll go xxx and play for a bit. There is literally no PvP or at least not enough to warrant a mention. No NPC summons for bosses, which for the most while not needed, are fun to include. When you consider things like the Cairnhurst Storyline and the queen, Annalise was ripe for a bit of NPC's player team action with Alfred, and instead it all happens behind the scenes. What little PvP there is is also hampered in build variations. Lack of weapon types and armor is the same across the board, all builds and playstyles for builds are near enough identical. This game had huge potential and while some parts really tick boxes, the items i list here will hurt its longevity a lot. I played DS/DS2 for months but I can see me losing interest in this a lot quicker. As soon as I hit platinum, it's going back in the box.",6,2015-08-17,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Bloodborne2,"I was skeptical about Bloodborne at first, because of its link to the Dark souls franchise, those games are some of the hardest games ever made. But it set itself apart from the Soul's series with its dark 18-th century architecture world, and a fast paced strategic combat system that is more reliable than the slow paced shield blocking and slow evades of the Souls series. I constantly felt a presence of danger around every corner of this unpredictable and merciless world, but as I learned from my many deaths I honed my skills, and felt a level of accomplishment I haven't felt in long time or maybe ever. That is why I am labelling this the greatest game I have ever played, and I haven't said that since legend of Zelda: Ocarina of time on the Nintendo 64 back in 19 97, thank you From Software for gut-wrenching nightmare that I will remember for the rest of my life.",10,2015-08-17,PLAYSTATION 4,user

jeef1523,"Bloodborne, the successor to the soul series games, is an intense, fast-paced and critically thinking RPG that shows the the bloody and beautiful scenario of a beast filled Victorian England-themed world. It is yet another of those games that can make you bleed to madness if you don't get it right enough. Differently from the other souls games, Bloodborne makes you much more active in gameplay, basically eliminating the defensive stance, and forcing your approach to be more pro-active. Even if there aren't many items and weapons as the other games, it makes each and every one unique, trying it's best to be originally creative. And, for no surprise, it matches greatly, the PvP is improved, Boss fights seem more thrilling, even if not harder precisely, than the usual, alas granting an even greater satisfaction when concluded. The atmosphere in the game is very dark and mysterious, and it's a great match with the story, that even if it's not completely out there, is intriguing enough to make you try to understand it. In fact, Bloodborne's story is quite deep, it's only that it's so deeply hidden that usually doesn't get you in the moments that it should, rather making you aimlessly trying to understand something that was already explained to you. Nevertheless it's story hardly has a deep impact on the gameplay, in a way that makes you go by it if you don't want to, even if you shouldn't. The game initially has slight little issues, such as long loading screens (which where fixed through online patch), and a hardly unnoticed frame rate drop in specific locations, yet, obviously, nothing that should bother the gameplay itself. The game also is not so seductive in it's story telling to make you read every Lore and try to understand this world you're inhabiting, and the beasts you're fighting, but it's still compelling and mysterious in just the right amount. Overall, it is probably one of the best games to come to PS4 so far, compelling, thrilling, action-filled, and blood spitting rage are only a few of it's glorious characteristics that make him more unique, and like any other souls series game, completely satisfying. It is definitely a must try for PS4 owners 9.5/10",9,2015-08-13,PLAYSTATION 4,user
rajudgamer,"Below are the Pros & Cons for this game : Pros : Level design (best I have ever seen), Gameplay, Sound design, story, Monster designs (esp. boss), Boss fights, Chalice dungeons. Cons : 2 loading screens for moving from one level to another (I hated when I wanted to go to the hub & then select the level I intend to go & then again a load screen), FPS although 30 I came across several slowdowns (not a major con but I had to include), P2P ****.

Browney-Reviews,"There's one way I can describe this game amazing! I have played this game for 10 days so far and I have no plan on stopping. Bloodborne is set in a dark, depressing world where the populous of Yharnam have been infected by the plague of the beast brought on by the over consumption of tainted blood, turning them in to wolf like creatures, and this is were you come in, you are an outsider infected by the plague of the beast, in a attempt you go to Yharnam to get cured you do but sign a contract, enlisting your self as a hunter to fight the scourge of the beast. The game play in this game is fast paced and action packed due to the support of the PS4. Around every corner there is a enemy, trap or a surprise. The combat system works fluently and each weapon has two different form with different and unique move set to suit your style of play. There and 17 different bosses you can do In the story mode and each are extremely challenging (e.g. you will die, a lot), but once you defeat the boss you have spent hours trying to defeat the felling is amazing. For the first 3 bosses you will struggle and have trouble and contemplating quitting for you believe it is impossible but if you are one of those brave gamers and push on the game will change and you will final start to go on the attack and the game goes from scary and impossible to where you finally fell like you are a hunter (but you will still die, a lot). Each boss is intriguing and has amazing detail due to the high quality graphics of this game. But there is no game without it flaws like many glitches where you get stuck, but is easily fixed by quitting to tittle screen and going back into the game. and the lack of weapons but they have two different forms so each weapon feels and is unique. And finally the need to constantly go to a earlier part of the game to farm for blood vials. But even with these few gripes the game is still amazing and I know that this game should win game of the year. The game play is fun, scary and challenging so if you don't like a challenge you wont enjoy this game but if you like a challenge or was a fan of the souls series you will love this game.",10,2015-08-09,PLAYSTATION 4,user

PonyvilleCritic,"Bloodborne to me was exactly as I expected it to be. Ball-shrivelingly difficult with a very heavy emphasis on farming to get upgrades, I find this type of design to be tedious and boring yet I can understand how some people find enjoyment out of it, an eventual escalation to becoming an all-powerful badass, finally taking down that boss that's plagued you for the last 15 runs.

ChickenNorris,"From Software, when it comes to level design, story and gameplay always did a great job, being restrained by the PS3 lack of power, they couldn't exploit their full potential, with the PS4 and Bloodborne, they, pretty much made a master piece , in ever single inch of this game you can see the work they've put into the game. First playthrough if going blind, is like every other souls games, it's going to be painful and slow, the diffculty makes everything more rewarding, because when playing Bloodborne there is nothing like managing to kill this boss you struggled on for so long. Then when you get the habit of playing, all these little tricks and all these patterns you finish by knowing perfectly make it so that going through the game a second time is almost like a whole new experience. Even if like every other game you might get bored at some point (like I did) there will always be this little thought in the back of your head who'll tell you ""Oh what if I did this, that or that in Bloodborne"" which gets you back to the game and makes it as fun as the first time you've ventured through the streets of Yharnam.",10,2015-07-29,PLAYSTATION 4,user

CoNn3r_B,"I found Bloodborne to be a hallow and overall boring experience and here is why. Level Design: The best thing about Dark Souls 1 and 2 is the level design, no matter what you say about DS2 Drangleic(I'm pretty sure I spelt that wrong) is a beautiful and varied place with dark castles to bright vibrant forests and the same goes double to DS1 but Bloodborne is just the same dark grey/blue world which is permanently miserable and has next to no variation in the colour pallet. Weapons: Yes they are cool with how they can switch changing your combat style mid fight and yes they look sexy but there are so few of them, I came across only 7 weapons in my play-through and 4 guns which is disappointing as hell, in DS1 and 2 you couldn't go five steps without tripping over a weapon useful or no. They need more weapons asap. Armour: You are restricted in what you can wear now whereas is DS you could wear light or medium or heavy or **** world was your oyster but Bloodborne restricts you to coats and hats and like the weapons, they lack in variety. Combat: Combat is about the only redeeming thing in this game where it is fast paced and well laid out but it lacks the choice of DS, you could dual wield or use miracles or magic or sword and shield and so on so forth but in Bloodborne you are restricted to main hand and a gun, you can use both hands or torches and shields but they are so useless this time round, I went trough the entire game with the saw-cleaver and had no trouble which brings me to my next point... Difficulty: The main staple of the DS games is their difficulty, the hardest one to date is still DS1 and DS2 comes second, Bloodborne was easy in comparison, in my entire playthrough I died in combat 20 times rather than 150 in DS2 and over 200 in DS1. The enemies telegraphed their attacks from last week where most could be dodged by a quick back step anyway, the Bosses were so, so easy. Most were too big to actually hit you, you could just roll under them or step behind them and early on you become overpowered making the standard enemy nothing more than free xp. Story: To top it all off the story is god awful, this is a story where SPOILER ALERT the good ending has you turn into a **** squid...I'll let that swim around your head for a few moments SPOILER END the world tells you nothing about itself unlike DS1 and characters have no story what so ever, just showing up for nothing other than empty interactions or free items or you blow them or some menial crap like that. Overall: I didn't get a sense of accomplishment when I finished Bloodborne but instead I felt bored, I thought to myself what did I enjoy about this game and I found very few things to recall, I would mention the chalice dungeons but they can summed up in one word ""Crap"" I felt very disappointed in this game and opted to sell it and buy Dark Souls 2 Scholar of the First Sin instead which was way more interesting. 6.5/10",6,2015-07-29,PLAYSTATION 4,user
allwititnow,Wat a great game Sony was real smart fronting the money to publish a new ip.i think it's way better than dark souls although the games r similar in some aspects. I'm looking forward to some dlc. Graphically the game is gorgeous. The style is like no other game n enemies look awesome. The bosses r huge n the battles r epic. The game is difficult wen u start the game bit if u keep goin bak 2 base n repeat the 1st couple of levels n take the time to level up before u progress further the game will b a bit easier n more enjoyable. Trust me take a few hours n level up its worth it,10,2015-07-29,PLAYSTATION 4,user
mcwalsh,"From Software scores big again with a spiritual successor to the punishing Souls series. Deep, addictive, huge and brutal, Bloodborne is everything his predecessors ever was with better graphics, more dynamic to the combats and a backstory as sad and incredible as possible. A must for everyone who owns a PS4.",10,2015-07-28,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Hashtagyoloswag,"Bloodborne is the PS4's first truly must have killer app.When I first heard about Bloodborne's announcement I had become very interested in it's whole concept. I wasn't able to play it on day one because I hadn't had a PS4 by the time the game was released. But I was soon able to get a PS4 and my (new) uncle had his own copy of the game and decided to let me have it for free. Sometimes, I WISH I paid money for this game, because that's what From Software deserves for this gem. Bloodborne does not disappoint. First, let's talk about the what exactly BB is. Bloodborne is a spiritual successor to Dark Souls and Demon's Souls, borrowing the hubworld idea and horror aspect from demon's souls, the intricate level design from Dark Souls, and the amazing story ""telling"" from both. Deep down in it's roots, BB is a souls game, but there are so many ways it deviates and innovates from its successors that calling it a re-skin would make you look kind of stupid. The combat in particular is spectacular. It is no longer passive like previous games were where you hid behind your shield, observe enemy patterns, and strike when they're open. In BB, there's only one shield, and it SUUUUCKS. Most people playing would have no use for it at all. There is also no heavy armor, so you'll never worry about how fast you roll. The enemies are said to be three times as quick as the enemies in other souls titles, so you have no choice BUT to be aggressive if you want to live. This allows the combat to be more thrilling than ever before, and it will guarantee that you will find yourself on the edge of your seat. Now, you may have your doubts about the variety of weapons in the game, the number being 42. But each weapon can transform into a different ""mode"" that changes the damage, reach, and moveset of the weapon on the fly. So there are practically 84 weapons, along with sidearms like guns, which you use to counter enemy attacks and leave them open for a visceral attack, torches, or the shield I mentioned earlier. And just like any souls game, Bloodborne is HAAAARRRD. In fact, I think it's the hardest souls game to date! The enemies are merciless, they will use any chance they get to take your life, and you will be signing your death warrant if you're not concentrating and being careless. This game Isn't artificially hard, where any enemy could one hit you, or they just spam attacks all the time without relent. When you die, it's most likely your own fault. But when you've been losing to a boss countless times and you finally beat it, the overwhelming sense of accomplishment is unmatched. Bloodborne is also amazing with its story telling. In the beginning, all you know about the game is that you're some dude in some town called Y'harnam where a plague that turns men into beasts is ravaging the city. But what is unique about this game and its successors is how it tells you the story, which it basically doesn't. Instead, the story is divided into tiny little spoonfuls, which are scattered around the whole game, with some missing, leaving you to figure out what flavor they are based on that of the other spoonfuls you found. This is why some reviewers say the story is nonexistent in this game, because they were too lazy to look for it. The story is not given to you through cutscenes, but rather, little things, such as item descriptions, optional npc dialogue, the design of enemies, the layout of certain areas, and even the location of item pickups. This kind of story has created a large community of other people who play BB and work together to create their own theories and help each other piece the story together, like a massive lore hunt. In the beginning of the game, it all seems to be filled with horror tropes, but when you get deeper, the game begins to slowly turn into a lovecraftian cosmic horror story. Now, let's talk about the soundtrack, oh the SOUNDTRACK! If you didn't already know, the soundtrack was composed by Chris Velasco, the same guy who composed the God of War soundtrack. And, in my opinion, his work in BB is just as good as his work with God of War, if not even better. The soundtrack is used very sparingly, it's is only used when in specific areas and in boss battles. This serves to set the proper tone for everything from the calming peacefulness and safety of the hubworld to the tension of a boss battle. And the songs themselves are works of art. I often find myself listening to songs from the game on the internet and humming along to them because they are so good. Bloodborne came around at March 24th, 2015. It's not even September yet, but I think I've already found my game of the year. Bloodborne is a game I will play for ages to come.",10,2015-07-28,PLAYSTATION 4,user
dharma,"I never got into the Souls series before, knowing that they are hard. So here I am trying to find a killer app for the PS4, and I decided to delve into Bloodborne. To my surprise, despite its new gen graphics, it is at its core a 3-D Castlevania done right. Fighting monsters that pounce at you when you least expect? Check. Pattern memorization? Check. Dying absolutely ALL the time? Check. Suffice to say, it is hard but it's designed so well that once you get its mechanics, you'll be having a great time. You will die...a lot. But somehow, you learn a bit more about the game every time. The design of the city is sprawling, and incredibly interconnected. The controls are great and responsive. The first killer app for the PS4 and the best game to come out in 2015.",9,2015-07-27,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Kanivakil,I've only played about a few hours into this game but it is impossible to enjoy it for longer periods of time because the game gives me a headache due to its frame rate. The game does not run smoothly. It appears to stutter. I'm a PC gamer who is accustomed to 60 FPS so if you are a life/exclusive console gamer then I believe the game would be excellent for you--ignorance is bliss. I've deducted 5 points solely because of that reason. Otherwise the game is near perfect in terms of visuals and mood it presents.,5,2015-07-26,PLAYSTATION 4,user

However, after playing this game (and playing it well) made it one of the best video game i played in years. This game also made me come back to playing dark souls which is becoming one of the best as well. This game is not for everyone though.

VideoGame_Guru,"i wrote an indeph review but it wouldnt all fit so heres the end of it. As a whole this is by far the best game on the playstation 4 to date and has undoubtably kept me captivated, this is one of the most enjoyable and fulfilling games I’ve ever played and it has made me fall in love with this series, even after completing the game for the 3rd time I find myself going back to playing it just because it is so much more entertaining once you master the mechanics of the game. There has recently been DLC announced and I for one am very much looking forward to it. Not many games capture my attention like this one has and that is a rare thing especially recently when the market is full of first person shooters so this really has been a breath of fresh air. If you haven’t played bloodborne yet then I highly recommend you do and if you have been debating whether or not to purchase a ps4 then I think that this game could just be the decider. Bloodborne 100% deserves the credit it gets and more. For that reason I highly recommend it to fans of the soul series as you will definitely enjoy it and newcomers will enjoy the learning experience that the game brings.",10,2015-07-20,PLAYSTATION 4,user

ford0075,"30 years of gaming and I've never encountered such a captivating, adrenaline-inducing experience. If you are considering Bloodborne, stop considering and start playing. You will be on the edge of your seat as you explore each new area where the moon light reflects off the blood-stained Victorian architecture in just such a way to completely immerse you in the environment. Your heart will race throughout each boss fight leaving you with an indescribable feeling of accomplishment when you prevail. Bloodborne's unique approach to story-telling will captivate you and make you think the way no other game can. Fair warning though, Bloodborne takes a sink or swim approach. You will wake up in the city of Yarnham and be left to you devices to start. The story unfolds through exploration instead of forcing you to watch cut-scenes. You will be killed several times before you will become adept enough at the fast-paced combat to move forward. Those that swim make it to the first boss, see the story start to unfold, and set out on an amazing adventure. Those that sink give up, write a negative review, and miss out on the best game of the generation. If you want your hand held, win fights by leveling up instead of improving, be force-fed a story through tedious cut-scenes, and explore a generic world on a horse that's more difficult to steer than a Formula One racecar then check out TW3.",10,2015-07-16,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Ryn_Ken,"This game has amazing combat, exploration, lore and visuals, but it gets more then enough praise as it is. So I'll be focusing on what I think could have been improved. The first issue I ran into was the rate at which a gun stagger would work but still leave me injured by the enemies attack. The health regain system can often make up for this since an effective visceral attack will immediately refill the lost health, but in situations were the attack stuns you for too long to take advantage or one shots you it starts feeling like a flaw with nothing more then a bandage on it while being called ""fixed."" There are a lot of moments in this game where the developer's idea of difficulty is the amount of times a player can be killed by a single quick attack or stun-locking combo while giving the opponent far more health then they have any business having. Where the game should have been going for a feeling of accomplishment by rising to the challenge it sometimes only left me being glad a cheap enemy was finally dead. The loading Screens were an annoying problem when the game released, but even after the patch to reduce the amount of waiting and giving you something to look at during it there is still a big problem with this system. There are far too many situation that require two loading screens when its shouldn't have required any. This is because they wanted to hub area to be an important place for the player, but it comes at the cost of convenience at every turn. Want to level up? two load screens. Want to change your runes? two load screens. Want to upgrade your weapons? two load screens. want to buy something? two load screens. want to go to a different area? two load screens. The lack of different weapons isn't a flaw in itself but it does manage to cause a problem that was avoided in the other FromSoft games. Since almost every weapon is essentially its own weapon type any of the ones found later in the game will be like lost potential as you think about how much you would have liked using it on the bosses you've already beaten. And lastly there's the unimpressive NG+ which is nothing more then the exact same game with the same enemies, but with more health and dealing more damage.",8,2015-07-16,PLAYSTATION 4,user

dillymonnn,"Can't even give this game a score and I'll tell you exactly why. Looking for something with impossible difficulty, no story line, no tutorial/note ridden game with an inventory screen that looks like a 500 page novel? Oh, and not to mention trash combat mechanics? Well stop right here nerd, because this is what you've been dreaming of. I can't express the anger and frustration this game has caused me to feel. I am a very well seasoned gamer, and I can pick up pretty much any game and play through it. Not until I placed this game inside my ps4. Optimistic after reading a wealthy amount of fantastic reviews, and trading in my Destiny and Battlefield Hardline towards it, imagine my surprise when I get thrown into such a terribly made game. I played a good 24 hours, and I kid you not, I was stuck on the first checkpoint the entire time. That's right, the first level. getting frustrated at this game is an understatement. If a well rounded gamer like me can't get passed the first level, then how the hell is anyone else supposed to do it?! If your looking for a game that will make you angry, then go no further. Granted I don't know the full extent of the game because, well, the game doesn't explain jack **** to you. It throws you into some weird overly dramatic sophisticated character creation screen, then straight to reading a bunch of nonsense you wont remember, then comes the dying and restarting. Evading? better hope its timed better than Einstein's Quantum Algorithm. Trying to heal? Better hope you're 5 miles away from the nearest enemy. Want to just run through the entire level and avoid a brain rupture? A great idea, but you Better hope you're ready for the boss who is 5 million levels higher than you with a health bar that goes off the screen at the end :) Just like the dark souls games. Which in my opinion I have no idea why anyone gives these worthless annoying games any attention. What are you trying to achieve in a game with no story/dialogue, crappy fighting mechanics, and stupid little inventory pick ups that you don't even know what they're used for?? just keep restarting, dying, losing all your points, no checkpoints whatsoever I mean give me a break! who finds pleasure and excitement in these games? I mean unless you're some fat nerd who grinds it all day to make one checkpoint?! sorry but I want to live a long and healthy life, and this game is gonna cause me to have a seizure and heart attack at the same time. Not only does this game feel and resemble the dark souls games, it might as well be a sequel to them. waaay too similar to be considered a whole new game. So, what have we learned today? Bloodborne is a game that was copied and pasted from dark souls and probably took 3 months to make, with no story, a great character creation screen, terrible and delayed fighting mechanics, and a giant empty inventory with worthless junk, in fact you should put your own temper in the inventory to be honest. if only it were possible /: very disappointed with this game. okay im done.",1,2015-07-15,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The only one to run is the one you shot. because of this the game can be a lot easier than the Dark Souls series and that can be a turn off from this game.

For the life of me I couldn't figure out how to stay alive in this cruel world. However, every time I shut off my game in frustration, I always came back to it. There was something about this game that just never left my mind. And, after dying several times, I began to realize what I was doing wrong, and I actually began to get pretty good at the game. Each boss has their own strategy and their own weaknesses, and figuring out how to exploit them was such an amazing feeling.

Almost instantly i fell in love with it. As a pc gamer this ps4 exclusive is my new favorite game of all time just barely passing skyrim. Now if you have never played a sould game then you should know that this game isnt to be taken lightly. It isnt difficult as in borderlands or those cheesey inde games that are hard for the wrong reasons. Its hard because its a game that requires true pacience and mastery of your movement weapon and personal play style. The game is very tedius and when a simple 3 hit combo can kill you in an instant you better be on your toes. Probably the best redeeming value to this game is its endless replay value along with co-op(fun although very limited) pvp new game plus that can go up to 100 if you really want to play it that much. The games difficulty keeps it from eventually loosing its charm becuase no matter how good you are you will always die to one good screw up.

Birdie,"A really fun game lasting a couple of playthroughs. Fun but few weapons with a cool approach to action. But the lack of diversity regarding builds and weapons makes the PvP experience short (If you compare to Dark Souls 2 for example which I've played for hundreds of hours and still not tired of it). It's also very hard finding people to fight. An arena would at least let you fight regularly. If you manage to fight you quickly notice that the action system isn't really that great for PvP. You get stuck all the time, people heal to easy and the jumping system isn't optimal. Sure, you don't need to lock on to role instead but I want to role AND lock on. Oh well, I'm hoping for a DLC that will fix things. I still give the game an 8 out of 10 because the atmosphere and fighting is really fun outside PvP. The game is way too easy though. I completed it in around 3 hours with my second character. My first playthrought took around 30 or so hours. The challenge lies within the later Chalice Dungeons instead.

The game is simply spectacular, the minimalist story is great, the graphics are better than acceptable, and the risk for reward difficulty system is amazing. The only reason why someone wouldn't like this game is if it's too hard for them to play or finish; that's all that could be notably bad about it. But with the difficulty comes great reward, whether it be beating a boss or getting past an area, every moment will fill you with joy. The setting and environment are some of the best ever made, it is not a typical horror game in a sense that there are jump scares and such, but it is more building tension due to the amazing orchestrated soundtracks and sound effects. Also, if you buy this game and finish it, and don't know what the hell the game was about, you've got some serious lore reading to do; because there are plentiful amounts of it, and every part of it is astonishing, how every single character, and every single small thing that you dismissed as a part of the environment would turn out to be some of the most important concepts in the game. But anyway, all in all, do yourself a favour and buy this game; it's simply brilliant.",10,2015-06-11,PLAYSTATION 4,user

heatonx23,"This has become my all-time favorite game. I never played any of the games in the Dark Souls/Demon Souls series, so like a lot of people I was nervous about the difficulty and learning curve involved in this one. There were definitely times in the first couple areas where frustration would set in and I would swear off playing it any more. But for whatever reason, it's addicting, and after playing a different game for a few minutes I was already thinking about Bloodborne again. After a while, you get used to the format, gameplay, and strategy, and it just becomes amazing to play. I've gone through the entire game twice now, and I still play it a lot for the chalice dungeons and co-op. Absolutely love Bloodborne. 10/10",10,2015-06-10,PLAYSTATION 4,user
WoshJills,"I bought Demon's Souls. I bought 3D Dot Game Heroes. I bought Bloodborne. I fully support From Software and know they make great games. I get it: Bloodborne is supposed to be challenging. That said, the game -- simply put -- has too high of a learning curve for new players and is designed to be too frustrating. At one point in the game, I had to ask myself, ""Am I having FUN?"" and the answer was an absolute, ""no."" I don't know about you, but I play games to have fun. Bloodborne is a great game, but it is not a fun game. I respectfully disagree with From Software's choice of purposely making their games more difficult for players. There are people out there who enjoy challenging gameplay -- and From Software is definitely catering to that demographic -- but I would not recommend this game for the average person. From Software would probably argue that they breed frustration into their players to give them a sense of accomplishment once they beat a part of the game, but I would say there are other ways of giving people those emotions. I wish they added different difficulty modes to the game -- or have a dynamically adjusting difficulty -- so players can find themselves ""in the flow"" (that is, their skill matching the challenge difficulty at hand) more often. (See: Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's theory of flow.) Simply put, Bloodborne is a good game. However, it's not ""fun."" It's more like having to read Shakespeare or Henry David Thoreau while in middle school -- painful at first, but an acquired taste.",6,2015-06-10,PLAYSTATION 4,user

drevil99,"Definitely one of my favorite games for PS4. The awesome combat system, the beautiful graphics and that eerie Victorian horror atmosphere, it's all top notch! There are a ton of secrets in this game, as well as 3 possible endings, which makes this game very replayable. Now comparing this to Dark Souls 2 SotFS game which I just played before it, i will say that Bloodborne is hard, but not frustrating. This is because of the new battle system that's in place which is fast and aggressive (unlike DS which is defensive). Also Bloodborne gives you the choice right off the bat should you want to play online or offline. This is a big plus since you need to basically unplug your router / unplug internet / sign out of PSN connection to trick DS2 into offline mode. My point here is that Bloodborne does not force you into unwanted PvP like DS2 does. In any case, my only critiques of the game (and this is minor nitpicking on my part): Ranged weapons don't do much damage, even when upgraded, so I find myself using them rarely. Also, there is no tank / caster builds in this game like in other games, but I suspect this is to stay inline with the Victorian era atmosphere. Last but not least, I find myself unable to summon NPCs in offline mode, not sure if this is a bug or not. However, having already beat the game and being halfway into NG+ solo, I don't think it's a big loss.",10,2015-06-08,PLAYSTATION 4,user

This game is definitely amazing. The boss design is unlike any other game.

Explodet,"More of the same with a different setting. These games are always overrated, not as difficult as hyped up to be, and really just a slow tedious experience. With no real story and interesting characters to hold things together, it's just more run around killing random monsters, which gets old wuick. With a rabid toxic community, they can just keep releasing mediocre games and still sell an easy million.

Brontran,"Bloodborn is some of the most fun I've had with a game in recent history. I enjoy the creepy atmosphere, the Gothic style aesthetic, and how the world connects back into itself through opening new pathways, doors, and elevators. Making what is essentially a dungeon crawler feel very open. I love how the trick weapons offer differing weapon styles within a single weapon; cane whip, Ludwig's bastard sword, twin blades of mercy etc. But what I enjoy most is its difficulty style, I love that it requires you to learn what each enemy does, their patterns, their weaknesses, and to exploit them. I am incredibly bored with the plethora of simple games that I can just blitz through without really paying attention or caring. The difficulty style is what truly defines this game, and the first fight in it, will define whether this is a game for you. I don't know too many games which feel similar to this and I think I will continue to come back to it years later, like I do with Arc the lad :Tots, Baldur's gate, and other great games.",10,2015-06-06,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Holyhesk,"If you are looking for a deep engaging story you will be disappointed. I shelved this game after interacting with a few npcs. Their mouths stay closed when speaking, Why?. The Dialogue is also very bland. People are raving about the combat but to be honest it's repetitive and boring. Enemies are lifeless and walk around the world aimlessly. The Character sheet is as basic as it comes. While you feel your character is progressing and getting stronger it just doesn't feel as though you are building a unique person to a certain playstyle, you just spend points increasing health or strength and that's about it. There are some nice visuals and the boss fights are challenging but sadly not enough to keep me playing.",4,2015-06-05,PLAYSTATION 4,user
WaffleFox,"I've played all the Souls games before this one. However I'm an offline gamer, please keep that in mind, I only play the games in offline mode. Bloodborne is much like the previous games. Create a character, grind a bit, die, and repeat. I was not very pleased with this game though. The previous games in the series were more about strategy. Should I block this type of enemy? Maybe cast a damaging spell? Perhaps a heavy weapon would be better. Bloodborne strips away most of the strategy that I enjoyed. Now in this game you have a gun in one hand and a melee weapon in the other. These are basically the only weapons you will have and the selection of weapons in the game is quite limited. Despite lacking a wide selection of weapons, your character is more nimble in this game. Making this game more about speedy combat. The gun is useful for stunning enemies if fired at the correct moment, such as an enemy lifting their blade to swing. Hitting them at the right moment causes them to become stunned and vulnerable. This is basically the only thing the gun is good for, as it does very little damage. What makes things worse is about half the enemies cannot be stunned in this manner. The melee weapon is pretty cool in this game though. Each weapon can switch modes. Usually they switch between one handed and two handed modes to give a little variety. This gives the options of quicker yet weaker attacks or slower yet stronger attacks. Spells are non existent, at least for the player. Enemies are still able to cast spells at you from a distance while you cannot. Instead you must attack them head on, trying to dodge their spells and hoping that you don't get hit. Being unable to cast spells gets rid of the ranged strategy. (even though you have a gun the bullets don't travel far at all) Shields have been removed from the game except for a wooden shield. However this shield is useless and should never be used. Strangely enough, enemies are still able to use shields. But for the most part it's just as useless for them. Lack of shields removes a defensive strategy from the game. Bosses are interesting in design but that's all. Combat with them is basically the same. A giant lumbering monstrosity that never stops swinging, all because you have to be near them to inflict damage. Controls are just as bad as all the other souls games. Push a button to dodge or attack, it's going to take half a second before your character actually begins the animation. Doesn't sound bad but when timing is strict, this just ruins it. Graphics are actually quite nice. The game looks beautiful and it's obvious there was more attention to the scenery than anything else. Hit boxes are still an issue. You can be behind an enemy when they swing forward and you'll get knocked on your back. Or even roll to the side of a downward hammer swing, only to be flattened onto the ground by nothing. Story is pretty much non existent, very much like the previous games. Pretty much the same story too. Everyone's got some curse or disease and now they hurt people for whatever reason. Kill them and stuff. Overall the game is just meh to me. Clunky controls, broken hit boxes, limited strategy are things that ruin it for me. Killing things is satisfying and the game looks wonderful. Difficulty is close to the same as the previous games. Challenging, but for the wrong reasons. Also, I have beaten this game so I didn't just play this for 5 minutes and stop.",6,2015-06-04,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Iberian_Buffalo,"oh good. This game is so annoying. Terrible camera, expecially in chalice dungeons. Targeting system with big monsters is joke - Amygdala. Boring weapons - everyone play with ludwig sword or hunter axe, rest weapons are terrible in pve. So why game is build around long weapons only? First time I completed game with Stake Driver and it was super hard but 2nd game I completed with ludwig sword - autowin. Some minor performance drops but well, ok. I dont get those high scores, dame is decent but 6/10 - history is said in Destiny way - some minor descriptions on items and almost no history in game - in destiny we had game cards that were describing story. So destiny story was **** and bloodborne is great? For me it is the same week narration. Actuallly there is no big selection between characters - there is one solid build - quality build and 1 arcane/ 1 blood that are simply weaker so at end there is only 1 solid build and 1-2 solid weapons in pve. Well locations are the same - all time grey walls, only interesting part is sky and moon, but city is boring(design itself is really nice but from start to end it is like the same location style - only caste is different due to snow). Chalice dungeons are super boring. Most chalice fights are borring and if you die in most cases is stupid camera( oh god, what a week positioning), targeting system, Only chalanging part is defiled chalice - due to stupid modifier. Another ""great"" game design. I was able to complete including chalices but I wonder why devs ignored all those casual fathers that want to enjoy time when kid go sleep. ps.

psychitout,"I'll be honest I hated this game for the first 20 minutes I played it. This game does not hold your hand AT ALL!! you are dropped into the game with no weapons, a basic rundown on the controls and left to your own devices. Then after dying over and over again from ultra strong enemies I looked up a tutorial online just to explain to me how to play the thing. Once I learned how to actually play it however, that hatred went away and I absolutly fell in love with this game. The graphics are breathtaking, the gameplay is tight and intense. The combat system especilly shines when going up against other players online, every fight feels like a test of not just your characters level but your skills as a player. Every single bit of this game is engineered and painstakenly tweaked to make you feel truely like an outsider indulging yourself in the first class horror show that is Yharnum. This is not an easy game by any definition but anyone who considers themselves an RPG fan or hardcore gamer would be a fool to pass this game up.",10,2015-06-03,PLAYSTATION 4,user
ToatzMcGoatz,"Bloody amazing. That is the shortest way I can express how great Bloodborne is. It's truly refreshing to take in a game of this depth and creativity without it being fed to gamers chopped up with season pass expansions and DLC galore - as many publishers are wont to do nowadays. This truly is a complete game replete with replayability with actual optional areas and encounters to experience; and combine that with the typical From Software strategy of crafting genuinely difficult games where they completely eschew any form of hand holding, you will be spending decent amount of time working through the game in order to experience all that's offered. First and foremost, the most obvious statement is that the game is initially difficult. This is to say it's difficult if you don't take the time to learn the control scheme well and how to accurately gauge enemy movements. Learning to predict what your enemies will do will ensure success to the highest degree and once you learn how to do this, the game difficulty plateaus. The controls are very tight and each weapon yields a different style of combat where different tactics are required for success. While the weaponry arguably is small, the sheer creativity and the fact that each weapon has a secondary form make it so their quality alone makes up for any perceived lack of weaponry. In addition to your main weapon, you have a sidearm reaching from pistols to flame sprayers. These are not initially intended to be powerful standalone attacks; they are meant to interrupt your opponents to stun and set up for a Visceral attack to yield massive damage, Understanding the mechanics of setting up visceral attacks are key to success for slaying many bosses. The bosses range from human like creatures, large abhorrently transformed beasts and H.P, Lovecraft influenced other worldly beings and play integral parts in the overall story. The story, in traditional From Software fashion, is not handed outright to you. Conceptually, for Bloodborne, this makes complete sense since you are an outsider to the central region of Yharnam - you are there for the healing blood and end up getting wrapped up in the wake, needing to unravel the mystery of Yharnam to transcend your hell. The story only becomes fleshed out as you progress and discover items and notes to piece it together; and the deeper you go, the more vague it gets leading to conclusions to be made. A second play through greatly facilitates piecing together the string of clues. Having the story presented thusly helps to create a feeling of total immersion. The world seems natural - it lives and breathes like a real Gothic hell and as you progress through the brilliantly designed levels, the world seems to naturally evolve and grow more more insane the more you discover. For my first play through, never was I more terrified when i saw the telltale ""boss arena"" laying ahead in my path. I never knew what to expect and despite the plateau effect occurring mid-game for me, I never was looking forward to the frustration ahead. Despite the sinking feeling, trudging on and overcoming the bosses, especially when you get to the point of despair, gave me the best rush ever. Very rarely have I encountered a game that gets the endorphin's running that high; and for that, this, and other Souls' games are a special breed. While Bloodborne is amazing in many areas, there are a few technical aspects that pop up. The frame rate can suffer and long load times are the two main issues. While I've never had the frame rate drops be problematic, it is possible it may be others; and as for the loading times, it's annoying, but really only a nitpick; and really, any issue that is apparent is just that: a nitpick. Bloodbrone is by far the best PS4 game to date and may be for some time.",9,2015-06-02,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Headcrusher,"I'm updating my review which originally gave this game a 10 - the game itself is pretty good however if you enjoy the co-op and pvp aspects of the souls games you will likely be disappointed by the constant network dropouts and ""cannot connect to network"" and ""lost network connection"" warnings - every time this happens you will be booted back to the opening title sequence and have to try again. Even though souls games tend to be crowded years after their release - this game is quickly dying out because of this problem. The frustration should come from the difficulty of the game not the crappy network scheme. These days many companies either don't do enough beta testing or release games before they're fully operational - it's sad.

EHansen14,"From Software delivers yet again with Bloodborne. In this review, I give my opinions and ratings on the following: Gameplay, Story, Sound, Graphics, Last Impressions. This is followed by my final score. Gameplay: 10/10 - Bloodborne plays similarly to the Souls' series. This time around things are a little faster and the game attempts to force you into being a more aggressive player with the new healing system on counterattacks. The combat is fluid and responsive. When you die, and you will die, you know it was your fault and not an error in the mechanics/controls. Story: 6.5/10 - Bloodborne doesn't really give you much in terms of story, but if you played previous Souls' games you know the story is more in the lore, rather than being delivered in the game itself. You do get some sense of what's going on by talking to NPC's and watching the few cutscenes, but you can easily find yourself just killing monsters without actually knowing if there is a meaning behind what you're doing or not. Sound: 8.5/10 - The sound in this game is very good. Much of the music is soft yet creepy, which suits the world and art design of the game very well. You hear the effectiveness of every slash, and visceral attacks have a brutal sound to go along with the devastating look. NPC voice acting is all done effectively, but can at times become dry and difficult to understand. Graphics: 9/10 - The world looks absolutely excellent. Whether inspecting objects close up or looking far into the distance and landmarks you were previously at, the graphics do not disappoint. The gothic art style was something I loved personally, and really makes you feel as if Yharnam is not a place you'd want to be in for too long. The monster design is excellent and you can expect to see some terrifying and astounding enemies throughout your journey. Last Impressions - Bloodborne delivers in every way I was hoping it would. If you were a fan of Demon Souls/Dark Souls, you can expect to be a fan of this game. From start to finish it feels like a From Software game. Mechanics and gameplay are similar to the Souls' series, and Souls' veterans will find themselves getting used to this game quickly. Bloodborne isn't for everyone. It can be frustrating at times, but can also prove rewarding, if you're willing to give the time and effort to make it through the tough areas. Final Score: 9/10",9,2015-06-01,PLAYSTATION 4,user
bionicfox,"i've now played through the game and the bottom-line is that it's great - the style, the graphics and sound, the level design - all great, however, i feel there's a bit of a flaw. each level builds up to a confrontation with a generally ginormous monster which should pose a hefty challenge. However, the tactic for beating almost all of these beasts seems to be to wedge your character immediately behind the enemy and whack way - maybe i'm just doing it wrong. so in general the fights are a bit of an anti-climax and more general foes are much tougher to deal with, take snakes (in the poisonous swamps) for example. a very good game but, in my opinion, not quite as good as everyone's making out.",8,2015-06-01,PLAYSTATION 4,user

A lot of people complain that there are too few weapons in the game but i don't think so. The transforming weapons have a lot of combo that you can mix together allowing more variations of combat style. This game isn't your normal RPG. Bloodborne has it's own world, concepts that players need to realize. It is a completely different game and i bet the reason why this is getting a lot of bad scores is that people hate anything that is different to what is mainstream.

alexo774,"The game looks amazing, but trust me, this is pretty much the most overrated game of the new generation of consoles. No checkpoints doesn't make a game hard, it makes it annoying. Enemies who kill you in two hits aren't fun to fight. The game punishes exploration, because if you get a bunch of money and then die because you're lost or can't get back to the beginning of the level, you lose all of it! Frustration does not equal fun. Just because this game has one of the best atmospheres in a game ever doesn't make it fun. I don't play easy games. I've logged hundreds of hours in the series that this combat engine most reflects: Monster Hunter. But that game has the hard combat in a whole different way. You fight things that are hard to kill, but not overwhelmingly annoying, and there is a point to doing sidequests, and you are punished for making wrong moves, not moving one frame out of the line that the game forces you to go into. Atmosphere: Fantastic Controls: Great! Gameplay: Some of the most frustrating and awful gameplay that has come out of this generation of gaming. Sound: Awesome!

twistedreal,"Awesomely wonderful game! I found it to be a little easier and not quite as 'cheap' and frustrating as the Dark Souls series. Graphics are wonderful, combat flows very well, bosses are fun, and it has replay value! The good: this game doesn't hold your hand. Checkpoints are very spread out but there are shortcuts build into every 'level' so that you don't have to grind through the entire map again upon dying. Bosses are memorable and interesting. No shield which encourages aggressiveness and you have the ability to get your health back by landing attacks after taking damage. The bad: there are some parts where I feel like you HAVE to take fall damage which I didn't agree with. I also had to whip out the guide a few times to progress to the next area. A person could explore everything all around and eventually figure it out. If I didn't use a guide to find the path again I would have dumped another 10 hours into my first play through. Overall I highly recommend this game to gamers who are sick of the easiness that most games today have. The people I see who give up and rate it poorly are those who sprint into combat button mashing rather than going in with a strategy.

I just finished my first playthrough this week and after that I started The Last of Us Remastered - wow I had no idea that the graphics in Bloodborne was THIS good. Playing TLOUR almost hurts my eyeballs now - the buildings looks like boxes and after seeing amazingly detailed perfectly projected world in bloodborne I am really amazed that From Software was able to do WAAAAY better looking game than Naughty Dog. But enough about graphics (which is 10/10 for me). Lets get to other aspects of BB. Sounds. WOW when I think about all the atmosphere which was overflowing my brain when I played BB witch my headset on, all the scary sounds, amazing creepy feeling when i entered silent severs for the first time my ears was telling me this is the ultimate experience for them (again 10/10 - but I must say that sounds in this game are the best aspect of it!). Gameplay - pure frustrating fun. You all know that this game is quite hard. Controlls could be a bit more accurate (You can experience a little bit of problems while executing some moves) and the collision detection can piss You off when You get hit through the walls. Beside that gameplay is as good as other FS games - which I personally just love (so lets give it 10-/10). Finally let me tell You about something that other developers should try to copy from this game. Diversity.

If you play the game blind without any guiding, you would easily miss a lot of stuff. Multiplayer ****, while it's interesting to ring a bell, it's always difficult find people to play with, and if they die, they will be sent back to their own world. Co-op doesn't provide extra reward. Levels should be capped, instead of infinite, so that people don't have to limite their levels to find PVP easier(so dumb).",9,2015-05-26,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Shiftian_Be,"Never played any Demons games and so the first couple of hours were a rough introduction leaving me to turn off the game swearing multiple times .. But the artwork, the design, the combatsystem, just everything about this game made me come back to it minutes later. Now im facing its final boss and I can only say this game is amazing. A lot less hard after its initial two bosses (just grind until your level enables a difficulty you can cope with). IfI do have to be a critic I'd say the loading times are bad and the camera (especially when using the broken lock-on) can be an enemy on its own. Get this.",9,2015-05-25,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Raggedyryan,"Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but let's be honest, 0 out of 10 reviews for a game that has received the critical and commercial success that it has, are a teensy bit silly and not really credible.... Anyway, dummy back in.... I have only ever played a small section of Dark Souls 2 on PS3 and sold the console/game before properly getting into it. The others have simply passed me by and possibly I was put off by the renowned difficultly. However, after hearing much praise for this and being quite drawn into the 'gothic' setting I thought I would give it go... I am so glad I did as I have now completed this game twice and can honestly say it is without doubt the best game I have played on this New Gen and possibly one of the best games I have ever played full stop. Yes it was challenging, and yes I spent 2 - 3 nights repeatedly trying to beat certain bosses (I only get a couple of hours gaming a night these days..), but once I had beaten them, or a particularly challenging section of the game, I found the feeling of accomplishment and reward that I had not felt in years with a game. It is a game that anyone should at least give a go and I promise if it's given the time of day, you too will enjoy the sense of reward this game offers. Currently at 80 hours play and you don't get that kind of value for money from many games these days.",9,2015-05-25,PLAYSTATION 4,user

okc_rocker,I really enjoyed my time with Bloodborne and in new game+. The game has a lot going for it and it's a great start for a potentially amazing series. However I do feel it was a step down from Dark Souls. I felt like it was lacking a lot of in game items and gear. For me that is something extremely important for a great rpg. Items give a certain uniquness and depth to a character. Other than that issue the game plays perfectly. It's the challenge that I hoped for and would definitely recommend it to any gamer who enjoys a rough time.,8,2015-05-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user
ToFewViews,"If you have played Demoed souls or Dark souls I'm sure you know what Bloodborne is, and for you that have no idea what any of those are. Bloodborne is self **** in a kind of good way, everything from killing bosses, clearing areas and PVP gives you a great feel of satisfaction when you overcome it. The difficulty of the Demon/Dark Souls games have carried over to Bloodborne...mostly, some aspects of the game have been tweaked to make it a bit more user friendly and less frustrating. You still lose all your ""Blood"" or ""Souls"" When you die and ""Lanterns"" or ""Camp Fires"" are few and far between. Bloodborne has eased up on traps witch is nice, Nothing is worse then getting killed trying open a door or chest. The combat in Bloodborne is quick,tight and responsive just like previous games, The addition of of guns in Bloodborne adds a new level of combat, You can now parry people with a perfectly timed shot and punish them with huge damage afterwards. The weapons in the game are quite diverse and look amazing, Things like a giant wagon wheel, 2 handed great-sword or a cane whip all have their pros and cons to battle and let you build a character based on how you play. Level design in the game is amazing, Big Gothic city's and cathedrals look terrifying grouped with the equally as terrifying enemy's at times. Some of the enemy's you fight feel very overpowered and will take you quite a bit to bring down, But don't forget Bloodborne has Co-op! Sadly it's not as easy to use as some would like but it's very helpful being able to bring you friends/randoms into boss fights to give you a hand. The bosses in Bloodborne are also horrifying at times for the most part and give you a great sense of fear when you finally find one and then proceed to die to it multiple times. The storyline is dark and twisted but also hard to follow at times but still a interesting part of the game. If you like a challenge to your RPG or you like high blood pressure I recommend you give Bloodborne a try, It's not for everyone but I'm sure a few people out their will love a game degree.",8,2015-05-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user

EpikTheMaster,Welcome to bloodborne possibly the greatest PS4 game currently. This game is a masterpiece in so many ways: -The gameplay mechanics are actually fun especially for a hard game. The difficulty is believe or not a mechanic that keeps you thinking on your feet on how to tackle a group of enemies or whether you should use this item or this item for taking down a specific enemy. -Whenever you kill a boss you always feel like you accomplished something great. As if like in real life you just accomplished your dreams or you wanted to get this item or this item....whatever! -The backgrounds in this game are stunningly beautiful and make quite awesome monitor wallpapers. -The controls in this game are the best I have had since the time and make me feel like I was actually controlling my character. -While the graphics may not be as great as like Mortal Kombat X or The Order it still manages to look nice. - The Difficulty. The difficulty shows you that games are sometimes not just a walk in the park. that you cannot simply just charge in and expect all this crap to just come to you. You need to work for it and when you do after a number of deaths and Blood vials you will be proud of yourself for finishing this game. -Everything else that I didn't mention including the hunter's dream. There is just one small problem about this game and sadly that is: THE LOADING SCREENS. but you can get used to them. The game has some quite tense moments and when you die or are going to wherever there needs to be a loading screen you will be annoyed but then realize the loading screens might be actually long on purpose. They are trying to give you a break and have you relax for a few moments. Also I have a tip: Don't kill any of the friendly NPCs you meet like Eileen the crow or Alexander. They have some great quest lines that you can miss by just killing these people. Bloodborne gets a 10/10 for being a Universal Acclaim,10,2015-05-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user

EscapetoGame,"Very controversial to give bloodborne a bad rating but while I find the game to be quite well designed in terms of enemies and level design, it's in its gameplay where it just did too much to take me out of the experience without doing enough with its story and content to keep me involved. The best thing about it is some epic boss fights but the stuff inbetween don't feel purposeful. Having to kill the same enemies over and over again is a good recipe for those who like a ""learning through repetition"" game but for someone who looks for much more variation and story, it fails and becomes a repetitive bore. I finished this game hoping each step of the way would bring something new and different but was disappointed at having been left feeling empty and just glad it's over.",6,2015-05-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Boneh,"I was sure my hype would be extinguished like with many games released earlier (looking at you Destiny, I´ll never forget the disappointment), but I was pleasantly surprised by how the game exceeded even my hype. The combat is fantastic! I really enjoyed how they removed shields from the game (apart from a wooden raft which is used as a shield, but it´s really feeble and won´t protect you at all), making the game way more fast paced and encourages you to take more chances, since if you get hit, you have the chance to recover some of that lost life by quickly attacking your opponent after you get hit. This adds a lot more strategy and depth to combat and keeps bloodborne separated from the darksouls/demonsouls series. The story is really interesting, though you need to look for it, since it won´t be spoon-fed to you. If you like to run through the game (which won´t be the case, since it requires a lot of strategy and being careful) you might not even have a clue why everything is so messed up in the world, it´d be a pure gory experience, which I don´t find it bad at all, but the story adds a lot more to the game and is so rewarding finding out everything about the bloodborne universe. Averall I personally couldn´t find anything to complain about this game. Sure loading screens where bad at the beginning, when it was launched but they fixed it with a patch. The game rarely stutters graphically now and is such a joy to keep playing it.",10,2015-05-21,PLAYSTATION 4,user

DawnofAaron,"From Softwares greatest game yet!! The dark and scary Victorian Era London was a perfect setting for a horror rpg like Bloodborne. On eof the greatest games I know that is set in Voctorian Era London was Dishonored which ended up being one of my favorite stealth games. I am so happy that Bloodborne sucedded in this new idead. The games has so many different paths and shortcuts to take which makes it feel like you are following your own path instead of the developers path that they made for you. The new Thief reeboot only had one path for each mission which was why it ended up failing as a game. Even though Bloodborne does not have as much weapons in it like the souls games, they are so many combination of combos you can kill your enemies. Each weapon has 2 modes, one for fast and short range damage, and one for slow and longe range attacks. For exmaple, the Kirk hammer can be aquired from defeating the first boss in the game and can be a hammer or a sword. All of the bosses look and fight differently which makes that player have to observe their moves so that they know when and where dodge. Dying in this game feels more like and learning experiance instead of frustration and the combat is very unique. The leveling up system is also unique because you can choose what you want to level up like, Vitality, Stamina, Strength and much more. The map also has enemies hidden behind things ready to sneak attack the player which causes lots of suspence in each new area for the player. This game is definitely worth buying at $60 dollars and if you are not sure whether to buy a PS4 or Xbox One, Bloodborne will make you want to get a PS4.

SkekTek,"This Lovecraftian masterpiece is the proper 3D Castlevania that we've never had. The ancient city of Yharnam is dark, beautiful, and unsettling. The world of Bloodborne itself is a delightful fusion of Demon's Souls' hub system and Dark Souls' thoughtfully interconnected worlds. The Lamps that punctuate the world allow you to travel to the Hunter's Dream from which you can travel to any other lamp you have already lit (unless there are hostile Hunters near a Lamp, then you will need to slaughter them before the lamp can be used again). The world>dream>world transfer does introduce a superfluous loading screen but saves you from having to find and fight your way back to a prior area without destroying the cohesive world by vivisecting it into individual components. Yharnam itself is dark, very dark, almost opressingly so. Unless you severely cheat on your screen settings you will make good use of your hand lamp and torch. The torch itself can be used as a weapon and can afford you a tactical advantage against enemies that fear the light. There are plenty of optional areas and items to reward your curiosity and exploration. Intelligently crafted shortcuts can be opened to mitigate the tedium of fighting your way back to particularly difficult boss. There are also dungeons that you can create and explore. Up to 3 cooperators can be beckoned (2 players and 1 NPC) into a world. You can connect with specific friends easily by the use of an 8 digit code (I often use my PSN+ username). You can also invade other player's worlds (why not make a hard game even harder for an unsuspecting stranger?). There are three covenants that you can join - all of them are invasion based with their own objectives. Each covenant is at odds with another. This adds an interesting dynamic: it is possible for cooperators, who are supposed to be working towards a common goal, to become hostile towards each other. Of course being a 'Souls game Bloodborne is hard, not cheap-leaving-you-no-choice-but-to-memorize-enemy-positions-and-patterns hard, but you're-not-good-enough-YET hard. Bloodborne isn't difficult for the sake of being hardcore, it is difficult to make your successes sweeter.

nonchalantgamer,"As a fan of the Souls series before it, i was heading into Bloodborne with the expectation of success, and i was, as expected, satisfied. There is no denying that there are immense similarities to Bloodborne and the souls games before it, but even though it has a similar feel, Bloodborne still distinguishes itself as its own unique game. First off the combat, it has some similarity to Dark Souls, but the pace is significantly faster and most souls fans including myself have to change tactics from hiding behind shields, to being more proactive in combat. It is still immensely satisfying to slay your enemies, and the inclusion of guns as more of a helpful tool instead of a powerful go to weapon works well and can be lethal if used correctly. Boss fights are great and the design of most bosses is spot on, and although i came across some really easy bosses, most proved to give ample challenge, and some extreme frustration, which makes the payoff of victory that much sweeter. Overall i would say that Bloodborne is harder than Dark Souls 2 and perhaps just as challenging as Dark Souls. Probably what immerses me the most about Bloodborne is the gorgeous environment, with exceptional lighting, and design that really evokes a certain mood in the player. Some areas are just gross and gave me feelings of dread like blight town had in Dark Souls. The Soundstrack is also equally mesmerizing with a sort of gothic style twist to it, really sets the mood. There are some frame-rate dips, and slow downs occasionally but nothing that really detracts from the overall experience. Story is as you would expect from a From Software game, where you must attach breadcrumbs along the way and try to unravel the mystery of Yharnam, and all its be-holdings. There is enough story to grasp at though where you feel some progression but full attention to detail is a must, or else you might be a little confused at the end. Bloodborne to me might be up there with Dark Souls in terms of best From Software games, and after completing the game, i keep coming back for more with NG+, as well as the chalice dungeons, which offer even more to surf through and discover.",9,2015-05-18,PLAYSTATION 4,user

One improvement I'd like to tip my top hat to are the bosses, you can actually visibly hurt them. In Dark Souls you just kinda poke them until their health bar runs out. In Bloodborne if you hit them hard enough they'll stagger. It adds another layer of immersion when it actually feels like a brawl with these things.

Muzzle131,"Alright right off the bat, this game is simply amazing best thing and will stand on a throne until Miyazaki and his brilliant mind comes up with something else. Even then the game has one really big flaw and that's how new players aren't allowed. Or at least it seems that way, me I'm a hardened souls veteran, so me and another souls veteran could immediately know what to do. Yet that's a problem if your new to the souls series then your going to have a frustrating experience that you may end up having to have to have your hand held by a veteran somewhat ruining the experience. I've got countless friend requests asking for help by new players not understanding the game, and even then still don't understand even after beating it because they didn't get to absorb this knowledge themselves. So that's basically the only flaw in my eye about this game, it's for the souls player and community, I'd say to get the entire full experience you can alone (if your new) play DS2 first, as in my opinion it's a good introduction and work your way backwards to Dark Souls 1 and Demon's Souls (if you want) if you got through those games than you will have little trouble adapting to this, for the people who don't want to do that then get out...

RepulsiveFatMan,"A lengthy review for non-darksouls fans FOR SINGLEPLAYER MODE!. If you love darksouls, you'll love this game, so don't even waste your time reading further if you are. Graphics - 8.0 Not great (texture quality sometimes dodgy), but serviceable with amazing artwork to boot. Gameplay - 8.0 (average of the following numbers in the parentheses considered subcategories of this one) Difficulty and reward (9.0): This is where the game shines. The games challenge comes both in the ease with which you die and the checkpoint system, where checkpoints are few, BUT you can UNLOCK shortcuts to the next chextpoint through switches and modifiable objects in the environment. The boss fights are epic (and sometimes, but not always, extremely difficult compared to other games). You can also attack almost every npc in the game (awesome!). Combat (7.0): The combat is ... serviceable. There aren't any lengthy combos you'd find in other games, but there are attacks tied to each of your movements. The control is intentionally delayed and you can't spam attacks forever like in other games due to resource management, HOWEVER, from version 1.0 - 3.0 of the game there is a bug where the input lag in crowded environments can be severe, so at times (UNTIL THEY FIX IT!!!) it can be frustrating. There is also much emphasis on interrupts and you can find yourself ripping your hair out when the bug kicks in; assuming it doesn't, it does add a bit of variety to combat. Variety is a thing as there are plenty of weapons that are truly unique that you can use in tandem regardless of your build. Content - 8.00 Game length (9.0): It is quite possible to finish the game within 10 hours. More than likely, unless you try your absolute hardest, using every guide, exploit, etc. it will take you 30-50 hours. It took me upwards of 70 (cuz I ****), but for most of that time I enjoyed myself and the environments are relatively varied; different enemies, different attack patterns. Replay (9.0): There is plenty of stuff to redo, depending on who you kill/align with and how you allocate your stats. The game gives you plenty of stuff to do both before and after you beat it (most I can say without spoiling). Variety (6.0) ""Hold on, didn't you just say that variety is great?"". It is. For COMBAT and combat is 100% what this game is about. The game does get extremely repetitive and boring, since the combat doesn't have much depth. To some people this might not be an issue, but to me not having a single puzzle in the game, or distraction from the non-stop slug-fest really bored me after awhile. Customization (character building) - 8.0 The appearance options are decent (in the direction of ES for a single race), but to me the most engrossing part was the different builds you can make with state allocations. Unlike similar games, you can actually create completely divergent play-styles (combat) based on how you've built your character. Story and ambiance - 8.0 Story (7.0): frankly, the story and dialogue are obtuse, poorly translated and perhaps even inconsistent, but the game lets you discover it on your own and doesn't shove it down your throat. People are even taking to filling in the gaps. Why the 7? The game has lore and all kinds of neat descriptions you can read, some silly character interactions and twists, or even outcomes you can affect. It's not the kind of story you'd sit down and read, but when you're slicing things up, it doesn't matter. Ambiance (9.0): This game is HEAVILY inspired by H.P. Lovecraft. The game nails it with stuff that fits some of the illustrations taken directly from the fans. The amazing soundtrack, dark environment, gory critters really help. Sound track - 9.0 Nice, sometimes orchestrated, but not overbearing. Not much else needs to be said. WORD OF WARNING: Although this review is generally positive, this game is ALSO difficult in the sense of tedious. When you die in a zone you haven't unlocked the shortcuts in, you will have quintessentially lost most, if not all of your progress. If you don't have any time during the day to spare, then you might want to consider this as a weekend game. Most boss fights are relatively easy to walk to, but getting there is the problem.....

Sky-Line___,"Bloodborne is beautiful, has its own genre, BUT. For me, the excessive difficulty covers a lack of content: only 14 weapons, 14 secondaries, the environnements are not so big and might be repetitive, there is no real scenario and the ennemies always have the same movements (farming can become really annoying after a while) Also, my biggest deception was the online mode: it is so so so bad, 5 minutes to join a friend, and make it as many Times as you die.

KouyaAotsuki,"For me this game wasn't all that good. The enemies are a bit more horrific than in most of the Souls series. Which leads to a higher focus on graphics which are great. They're crisp and dark. I just think they could've done the fur textures better. The audio's above par; everything has a nice sound effect that stands out. The voice acting is also equally great. The sounds of people screaming, bells ringing and more horror based sounds are a new welcome to make this game pops with more flair audio-wise. Now gameplay wise this game is a bit disappointing. The camera is more of a problem because of the tighter areas you'll be fighting in. The game is not as hard as any of the prior Souls games, but the gameplay is still there. But I feel that this game is dumbed down from previous souls games, but I guess that's okay. Oh! And enemies like to jump at you from corners which is childish. The story's okay, but a bit boring.

ghitopia,There is no reason to punish players to such an extent as in Bloodborne. It is mostly repetitive gameplay without much of a story line. Video games are meant for entertaining. This game arouses anger. Why do I have to level up 10 levels just to see a difference in my powers and defense? Why do I have to lose all my experiences every time I die? It doesn't take much to die either. No matter how high of a level you get an enemy will kill you with 2-3 hits. It's so frustrating to play.

jake_hewitt,"I bought this game about a week after release after seeing all the hype on YouTube. Although i haven't had a huge amount of time to progress through the entire game ( I'm currently on the third boss) i have thoroughly enjoyed my time so far. I had previously never played a souls game before playing Bloodborne however i knew i was in for a tough journey from the advertising and other reviews. I therefore went into it prepared to die a lot, and to be honest i had no problem with Central Yharnam, yes i died a few times but not to many. i also found the first boss i came across the cleric beast reasonably simple once i had learnt most of his attacks and knew how to dodge them. The difficulty set in with the next boss Father Gascoigne. It must of taken me at least 50 tries before i eventually realized i might need to level my character up a bit and buy some new gear to defeat him. Once i had done this though i beat him relatively quickly teaching me that in this game if you are struggling come back later when your skills are better and you are more prepared. after this point i have been pushing through the next segment at a slower pace than Central Yharnam yet i am enjoying it even more due to the more diverse enemies and environments. I really cant wait to see what this game has in store for me, however i am reluctant to give a 9 or 10 as i do not believe i have experienced enough to feel Bloodborne deserves a rating so high.",8,2015-05-13,PLAYSTATION 4,user

robh404,"This game is totally overhyped and it's flaws are the very thing many claim are its assets. For one, the controls ****. Your character reacts slow to commands while your opposition does not. Your viewing angles are often problematic at the worst times possible, and the game is built on a repetitive rinse and repeat formula that gets annoying fast. That being said, the world and in game characters are pretty good but the gameplay fails as it becomes more of a chore rather than fun. I love a good challenge but when half the challenge is overcoming control and design flaws it takes away from the experience.",5,2015-05-12,PLAYSTATION 4,user
CloudStyleGamer,"Bloodborne gets compared to Dark Souls on many fronts and it was always going to happen, but although the Souls feel is there FromSoftware have gone out of their way to make Bloodborne a standalone series. There are many things Bloodborne does better than Dark Souls 1 and 2, for one I am a huge fan of the combat system being a lot quicker and more offensive compared to DS defensive approach. Something I would like to see though is perhaps a combination or the ability to choose in the inevitable sequel. The PVP is definitely a little broken, it's so hard to find someone to connect and fights can be over in seconds due to the quick combat, also the health cut for invaders severely unbalances the fight. Enemy design is in my opinion, a little more interesting than previous souls games, the Bosses all look horrific and suit the games atmosphere outstandingly. The atmosphere is a refreshing change from Souls titles the Gothic medieval vibe is captivating to say the least. The level design is back up to amazing standard, every time you feel like you just might not make it, you find the perfect shortcut you desperately needed. Even as a veteran souls player the start of this game is brutal, until you get your head around the combat. You will get better, I promise, and when you do the game get a lot more interesting. Be patient and learn your enemies, learn your attack variations and study your surrounding, all to often people miss the subtle hints From leave about the upcoming boss. The addition of chalice dungeons was a good idea, executed on a average level. They are fun for awhile but get a little repetitive and boring but a good idea in practice and something that can be improved on. All in all this is a great game, but be warned it will be tough, you will die and you will have to repeat areas over and over. If that doesn't sound appealing you should probably watch a couple videos on it first.",9,2015-05-12,PLAYSTATION 4,user

quake2th,"don't waste your money on this game. You will be fighting mostly against bugs, nothing else. Boss fights are simply stupid, no mechanics or anything, just find the right bug (or bugs, almost all bosses will bug out and get stuck somewhere) and exploit it. From Software concept of a difficult game is: ""player weapons do no damage, monster do a lot of damage and have infinite health"", which might have worked in the 80s, but today is simply stupid and a very cheap way to create gameplay. Most of the times collision detection will not work, so you will be fighting against thin air, even though you hit an enemy right in the face. The overall concept might have been nice, but the experience is ruined by the huge amount of bugs. Looks like it went straight to the shelf, without QA.. I really cannot believe that someone from QA approved a game where 70% of the time the controller will not respond to your action. Might be fun sometimes, but after dying 250 times on the same boss and loosing about 400 blood vials, the games simply becomes boring. It's just luck, you have to hope that some boss will bug out or start doing stupid things (due to very poor AI). For example most of online videos will show the boss fighting against nothing and players hitting it from behind: the AI just bugged out and you can hit the boss from behind and it will not turn around. In a normal situation, you will never be able to go behind the boss and hit him, since due to animation lock-out (another stupid ""feature"", i.e. bug), the dodge animation must complete before you are able to hit the boss. Waste of money, at least until they fix all the issues.",3,2015-05-11,PLAYSTATION 4,user
joaopontesvaz,"Graphics: 7.8 Sound: 8.5 Gameplay: 6.5 Fun/Story: 7.0 Perhaps the most difficult review i do. First, i´m not a huge fan of this type of game (Action RPG) but my favorite game is a Action RPG (Ocarina of Time). So, that should´t be an apology. Second, the graphics... I read in the most sites they are fantastic. And i don´t see it like that. I see a really nice artwork with many technical failures (unstable framerate, colision problems and some blurry textures with low resolution). Third and the most important: gameplay. I like difficult games but i don´t like stupid difficulty such as far and far save points and must restart an entire part of the game. Honestly, this game has lack of lanterns (save points) taken into account the number of times we die. And to worsen the situation the loading times are long too. So this game is about repetition of dies and nothing bad about that but it carries the same time of wait and playing again and again some areas.

dubloon7,"Just like the Souls iterations before this, the lore is phenomenal. The downside to this lovely gem, even though it is primarily fun to play and the music is outstanding throughout, is that the fighting mechanics unlike the Souls series is clunky, lock-on **** and movements to dodge are horrendously activated throughout tough gameplay. The game slows down to a snails pace in certain areas of the game where there may be lots of enemies, but rediculous damages from enemy attacks clear from their swings/areas killed this numerous times for me as the devs clearly wanted to piss off gamers by leaving glitches throughout. Primary beef with any co-op/invading breaks the game entierly as numerous attempts on-end fail to connect directly to someone else's game, and are kicked to the goddamn title screen. FROM needs to fix their damn connectivity issues outright, but the story and length of game are great! Dark Souls 1>BB>Demons Souls>Dark Souls 2",9,2015-05-08,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Lion7,"The game is hard, and the challenge is brutal. Coming from Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2, the lack of block is definitely something to get used to. However, with the core gameplay differences, this is a fresh title with as much angry fun as you'd expect from this company. It's a must-have exclusive, but try it before you buy it. You'll love it or hate it. GAMEPLAY: It's brutal. There's no good way to describe it if you're new to the series, because there are very few games like this in today's market. Fights even with basic enemies are unforgiving and you WILL die in this game. Lots of times. This is not a blind hack-and-slash; it relies a lot on gauging enemies and adapting your tactics. Coming from Dark Souls and being a fan of blocking, the fact that you have to dodge everything and be much more conservative with your attacks led to many of my early deaths. Forget what you knew in Dark Souls, and approach this with a somewhat fresh mind. STORY: Again, what story? From's games are notorious for being vague, and telling glimpses of the story through item descriptions and tidbits of game lore you receive. People (mis)label this as an RPG; this is NOT Final Fantasy, or Dragon Age, or anything close to what I'd consider an RPG. This is pure action. ONLINE: The online experience is not as ingrained as it is with Dark Souls, though there are still plenty of bloodstains to laugh at.

oneflame,"Prepare to Die. Facing: bad camera controls near enemies and walls; pointless trips through multiple loading screens just to refill items, (like knives, ****, oil, etc); controls that have you jumping into mobs, when you are trying to jump/side step away; lock on targeting that will sometime work, or sometimes spin you so you are facing away; controller actions that make you time just what ""simultaneous"" pressing means with analog controller sticks--and then, doesn't work consistently. -- Bloodborne isn't an RPG, in that there is a ""Narrative""--at all, but feel free to make one up. It is more of a Tactical Action Game, with Leveling, and is very twitchy due to the mandatory dodge mechanic. ""Spoilers"" in this game are the methods and tactics to take down bosses, (like the Watchdog of the Old Lords). You won't really care what is happening in the game, let alone with your own character. Bloodborne is certainly is a great game, and Chalice Dungeons makes it even better--but you will spend most of that thought on how to avoid game defects--like not getting close to walls where you would normally channel foes, and bait specific attacks from them--because you will be so mindful of the camera glitches that stop you from seeing anything",2,2015-05-06,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Kuraditosin,"Bloodborne is definitely an oddball. It looks, sounds and behaves like a Souls game, but bares another name. It's a good thing I don't play games just for the name. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely adored all previous Souls games. However a new IP would be nice, or so I thought. So when Miyazaki announced Bloodborne, I was super hyped. However the first hours of the game caught me off guard, since I played previous Souls games with a shield and sword combo. I was baffled that I was bad at the game. It looked like adapting to a new playstyle was a challenge on its own. The art style and theme of the game kept pushing me further. Until somewhere between Vicar Amelia and Shadow of Yharnam the game clicked for me and I really started to enjoy the mechanics as well. Now I'm completing NG+ and finishing up the Chalice Dungeons. Things I liked: *A new intertwined gothic world with a magnificent art style. *Facinating monster and boss designs. *Trick weapons. *Peculiar NPC encounters. *Less humanoid bosses than in DS2. *No soul memory. *Obscurity of the story. *Gems and runes for upgrades mixes things up a bit. *Quick-stepping is a fun mechanic once you get the hang of it. Things I didn't particulary enjoy: *Shorter than other Souls games. *Fewer weapons. *Just 1 upgrade path for weapons. *No upgrades for armor. *Lengthy loading screens (an SSD and the newest patch mitigates this somewhat) Overall I recommend this game for any Souls veteran. Obviously the challenge will vary for people. I realize there are people who will never make it past the first few bosses and there are people who breeze through the game in 20 hours or less. Still if you're a new-comer considering Bloodborne, be ready to concentrate and be immersed. This is not a game to be taken lightly.

gwizzzile,"Bloodbourne is not a bad game, it just had big shoes to fill. The Focus was meant to be more on face paced combat than the rpg elements, but when trimming the game down it lost some of what made dark souls great. The great thing about a souls game was that if you rushed into an area with little to no preparation then yo would get destroyed, but if you took the time to upgrade the correct weapons and armor, the game was much more manageable. This element is lost a little in Bloodbourne. All the souls games are difficult and bloodbourne is no exception. It does do something wrong though. Think about the most fun you have had playing a difficult game.flappy bird on your phone, or super hexagon. What made those games fun was the fact that it was difficult, but as soon as you failed, you started with a clean slate quickly so you didn't have to dwell on your failures. Dark souls struck a good balance of punishment and ease of death. Bloodbourne not so much. I found myself dying on a boss battle, and instead of thinking of what I would do differently next time, all I did was groan because I would have to farm more bullets and bloodvials before the next encounter. And I would have to plenty of time to contemplate this on the atrociously long loading screens that are inexcusable on next gen hardware.

For example I dislike its looting design and lack of loot in comparison with past souls titles. Also dislike the lack of shields in it and how they are used and personally think they should have incorporated shields in same way and fashion that they did in past souls games. I find myself going back to demon souls and dark souls titles more often as of late due to its better looting design along with its bigger variety of weapons, items, and shields both to be found and used along the way nevermind its better use of its shields as well. Plus to me players should be able to choose their fighting style as its always been with any souls titles and players shouldn't be punished for wanting to play one style over another as it is in bloodborne with shields.",8,2015-05-04,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Lukester3000,"Bloodborne got me quite disappointed, since it is too similar to Dark Souls, mainly because of the game's physics and character advancement system. The look of the game is also very similar to Dark Souls, only the theme and story-related contents are different. Instead of being a cursed undead, you are a beast hunter in a most likely cursed dimension ( I haven't played it enough yet because each time I try to play it I end up being disappointed and I quit). The graphics engine seems pretty much the same. The targeting system is as problematic as the one in Dark Souls, what I mean by that is that if you target an enemy, all your moves will be centered upon the location of that enemy, which means you have to target and target off frequently if you do not want to do hectic moves and put yourself in danger from other enemies. And as they come frequently in fair numbers, you don't want to put yourself at risk. But the most frustrating I find about the targeting system is that if you have throwing objects you want to use (like the molotovs), then depending on the specific throwing item's motion pattern (e.g: daggers will fly in a straight pattern, but molotovs won't), you basically have no choice but to use the targeting option to hit your target, and if that target is moving away from you, you will be rather sure to miss and spoil your item, but if the target moves towards you, then, you'll hit them for sure. For the throwing, there is also the issue that the mechanics are slow at the wrong times somehow, so by the time your character actually throws that molotov you were aiming for that monster coming your way, you might as well calculate a good 3 seconds before he actually starts throwing the thing, by which time most monsters have enough time to come up right to your face and hit you, cancelling your move and leaving you vulnerable to attacks from other monsters. Which leads me to what I don't like about the combat mechanics, which can be quite frustrating sometimes, as you will most likely experiment. I got used to play without the targeting system because the targeting system just puts my character in danger most of the time, forcing me to retreat, heal, then go back towards the monsters. Just as much as you can get glitched by monsters sometimes, that you can get into some rather silly situations, all because of the game physics, which are basically the same as in Dark Souls (which by the way is the only game in which I've seen things like a boss jump down a bottomless pit because he just killed me next to it and the game physics detect my character as being close to the pit and the boss keeps behaving as if I were alive and jumps down the pit, which ended up with me never getting the unique item that boss would normally drop). Yeah, okay, people find the Souls games are hard and challenging. But are they hard and challenging because they are exquisitely well-made? I dare say no. I say they are challenging because they have serious game mechanic flaws that make them all look-alike and from one title to the other there is not that much innovation, which makes Bloodborne (in my opinion, which many probably won't care about) a game bred from a recycled, re-heated game concept we have seen before in the other Souls games. The graphics aren't that great either, they even slow down the framerate at times, which makes for laggy animation at times when you'd prefer to have a stable framerate (you know, these times when there are around 10 enemies in front of you, then it all becomes a bit laggy and then the framerate goes back to normal and leaves you trying to adjust?) You will also encounter the problem of having not too many pointers laid out for you (in fact, simply not enough pointers or info whatsoever), which will in turn leave you not to know what to chose at all concerning starting stats and / or weaponry. Seriously, I had to start three different games in order to try each weapon and compare the way they swing (because of the game's physics and how characters swing so slowly that you must calculate every move you do in a perfect way and hope that the enemies' AI won't do any hectic stuff in the meantime that you swing your weapon. So your weapon's swinging pattern is of the utmost importance, and once you chose a weapon (which you can't try beforehand or even see how the weapon swings or anything whatsoever except stats in numbers which can help give you an idea of the weapon's actual handling, but even then, this won't show you the actual moves), you are then stuck with that weapon and can't go back on your choice. Trial and errors takes its toll after a while. I truly regret having bought this online. I mean, it gives me even less satisfaction than the first Dark Souls and it costs 70$ CAN. Online gameplay is just as lacking and limited as Dark Souls', and by that I mean that it is annoying and doesn't bring anything new and exciting to Bloodborne. Anyways, very disappointed in the overall.",7,2015-05-03,PLAYSTATION 4,user

linkenski,"NB: A 10/10 from me does in no way indicate that the game is ""perfect"" but it is an expression of how much this game impressed me. Even as a ""Souls veteran"", having beat both DeS, Dark and Dark Souls 2 at least once before, I went into Bloodborne quite excited but fearing it might be slightly forgettable since I've played so many of these games now. On the contrary, Bloodborne did everything that needed to be done, in order to take the Souls format a step further while avoiding it becoming stale. There are a few noticeable negatives and I have to point those out if you're on the fence. These are things that might throw put off some people completely, while others may see them as improvements: 1) Total amount of items is overall quite less than in just about any other Souls game. There are still lots of unique items to find though. 2) There is a shield, but there is no way you're gonna make a satisfying build out of it. 3) Online PvE and PvP matchmaking systems are not as solid 4) NPC stuff and covenants are there but there's certainly less of it. ...but while these things by themselves disappointed me, it's the entire experience as a whole that I feel is completely on par with any other Souls game. In my opinion, Demon's Souls has the best story and atmosphere, Dark Souls has a more cohesive feel to it while retaining a good lore and plot, Dark Souls 2 lacks the great story or plot (but wasn't totally lackluster!) but made up for it in its sheer amount of content. Bloodborne feels like it has most of those elements in there as well and manages to stand out as a unique, memorable and fully valid game compared to the rest in its own right. The big draw for me, is its visceral combat and mindblowing lore... and I say that, because I feel like the game has a great but simple appeal on its surface but once you get halfway through the campaign you realize there's much, much more to the lore than you might have ever expected, and it doesn't reuse too much from Souls at all. But enough about me trying to sell this game for you. If you want a game you can keep playing for anywhere between 40-100 hours on your PS4 and have 60$ to spare? Bloodborne is the **** and among my collection of TLoU Remastered, Dragon Age, Destiny etc. Bloodborne is the first PS4 title that I feel really makes my purchase of the console worthwhile in the best possible way.",10,2015-05-02,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Big_Bear,"An excellent game by any standards, with an engrossing, dark atmosphere and superb core gameplay that other games can only dream of. Once again, you would have to question the sincerity of the 'critic' reviews that give a disappointment like GTAV 10/10, but less to a far,far better game like this, crazy. Also worth mentioning, as ever, the stupidity of any user review giving this great game a low score when the game is at least an 8/10. FACT. Good - The atmosphere really is superb, up there with Demon's and Dark Souls 1, the influence of the same producer is evident, and very welcome. No other game has a setting quite like this; gothic, dark architecture with a hint of steam punk, along with the desolate feel of the first 2 souls games. Character creator is good, graphics are good, core gameplay, as you would expect, is very good, both challenging and rewarding. Huge replayability. Bad - like very game in the world that lets you create your own character, why oh why does it not let you then edit it later on? I will never figure out why games don't feature this. For a souls game, there isn't very much gear at all. What is there looks good but only about 12 armor sets, pretty poor, same with weapons, not enough. Verdict - great game which will go up to a 9/10 with some dlc with another area or 2 and some new gear. If you like Souls games, you will like this.

raddirad,"This game is just awesome. More casual game than any other Souls game before. The enemies might appear hard but this game makes you think about your next moves and not just smash the hit button like a maniac. You have to discover the enemies move set and then exploit it. I died at least 50 times, most of them at the second boss just because I tried to smash it to death. On the other hand the game is fair. You get the right tactics, you get the loot.",10,2015-04-29,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Nukemi,"This game is a pure 10/10. ... Or at least for the first 50-100 hours. The game has uncomparable atmosphere, and it gets horror right in a souls game enviroment. The combat system is one of the best ever made and it combines the best aspect of previous souls games to a much faster format which is a delight to play. Everything works, especially now that the matchmaking and loading screens have been fixed. However, after you reach the 50-100 hour checkpoint, that is where the game plummets. Till then, this game is perfect. But, unfortunately after first one or two playthroughs, this game has none of the perks previous souls games had. NG+ Cycles are pointless and bit too easy for a fully upgraded character. Chalice dungeons are nowhere NEAR as good as the rest of the game and they need to be done on every character to get access to the only chalice's that matter. It's really really tedious. There are no covenants where ranking would matter. They are just empty shells of their former glory in previous souls games. I am nearly 300 hours in myself, and i just play the game because it's the game i want to play. The reality is, that i've been bored of the game pretty much since my first playthrough. This is by far the best souls game ever made... for the first 50-100 hours. After that it's just a souls game on life support as there are no incentives to keep playing the game what so ever. This game is simultanously the best and the worst souls game i've played. Everything feels perfect till the point when you first finish the game. After that, it's just an unifnished and unpolished mess. I would have loved to give this game 10/10, but i cant. I'm only playing it because i dont want to go back to old souls games anymore. I've got over 1000 hours in dark souls 2 alone, bloodborne will never be able to reach those hours invested. It's a shame. This game is pure 10/10 for the first playthrough, and somewhere along 7/10 or 8/10 after. Thus, i'm giving it a solid 8 out of 10.",8,2015-04-29,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Basquilly,"This is the best game I have ever played. Simple as that. Beautiful setting and atmosphere, fantastic story and direction, brilliant mechanics and fluidity and magnificent AI. It is also very difficult, but not so much as the previous From Software games, which for me is it's strongest characteristic. It is infuriatingly difficult, but with skill and caution, it can be conquered, resulting in a sense of satisfaction rarely experienced in video games. Where as I feel the Souls games suffered by being too difficult, Bloodborne poses a challenge to all who play it, but even those new to the From Software way of game design can get to grips with it and enjoy all it has to offer.",10,2015-04-28,PLAYSTATION 4,user
0javis0,"1st: Im not a troll :) 2nd: I´ll be really honest to you. 3rd: Ive never played previous Souls Games and sorry for my english :) SO: I was skeptical about this game, but actually i brought it a month ago. From that day, Ive played it every day for min. 1-2 hours. Its a great game, really a great game. Yes, It has its flaws, mainly the cryptic hard story (I didnt understand the whole plot, so Ive read it on web, and the storytelling is really atypical), some graphic/stylistic flaws like - the character creator, the character textures are not hi-res and mainly the problem with the ""silent"" npc (their lips arent moving). OK. But thats all for me. Now the CONS: The difficulty is briliant! The game learns you how to play it. There are ways you can make it easier but thats not the fun. Every time the game gets hard and you frustrated, step back and level up and go back and everythings gonna be all right. At the end, you will be really good in playing this game :) The first 4-6 hours are really hell, but its the first shock, believe me, if you manage to go through this point, youll be rewarded, trust me (mainly after you kill your fist boss). If you have problem to understand the game mechanics, you have to ask or try to find info on the web or videos. The level design is genius, everything is connected, youll see. You train your senses and orientation and do a ""virtual"" map inside your head. The atmosphere, music, van helsing victorian age styling is genious. The environmental graphics are impressive, the architecture is beautiful. Its really specific type of RPG, more action oriented. You have to master the combat, or you are in troubles :) The bonus dungeons are good too, with new enemie types too :) more hours to play after you finish the game, or you can star over again. Definetly wort the money (50 euros). I have a great time with this game, BUT BE AWARE, THE BEGINNING IS REALLY HARD .... BUT IF YOU PASS THAT, YOU UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING I VE TOLD HERE. Have fun, calm down, and begin the hunt.... or become the hunted! :)",8,2015-04-28,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Wrede,"First off all this game truly deserves a good score. It's very well made and full of detail. You can really see the effort that's been made to create this game. Gameplay is smooth and the controls work really well. Combat-mechanics are great and versatile. The trick-weapons are a great idea and make the battles more tactical. You have to use the right combination of weapons for the right situation. The challenge of the game is high and your going to die a lot (I did) as can be expected in a game made by Fromsoftware. But that's the thing about this kind of game, Challenge!!! If you don't like that then this might not be your cup of tea. To each his own. And the atmosphere is awesome. Bloodborne is set in a darkly beautiful world filled with horrors and creepiness, its almost as hard as the Souls games but still fair and awesome in all kinds of ways. I recommend this game to all who like this sort of thing. May the good blood guide your way!",10,2015-04-27,PLAYSTATION 4,user

GunshotPhoenix,"Bloodborne is without a doubt, the best PS4 game so far. The game is a exercise in patience and your ability to adapt on the fly. This game is not easy by any stretch of the imagination, even for Demon's/Dark Souls veterans. This game is similar to Dark Souls, but different enough to throw off veterans. Unlike most games that are easy enough to beat without too much effort, it is entirely possible to not beat Bloodborne if you don't learn how to play correctly. Mechanically sound, visually haunting, controls very well. Like other From Software games in recent memory, the story is interesting, but doesn't start to come together until the 2nd half of it. Combat is very fast-paced, yet deliberate and tactical. If you enjoy Dark Souls or Demon Souls, buy this game. I can almost guarantee you'd enjoy Bloodborne If not, at least consider the purchase.

Turbodowg,"Bloodborne is what the PS4 needed. A true AAA exclusive and Bloodborne more than delivers on its AAA status. Set to a Gothic background, Bloodborne is a hardcore action RPG which punishes players harshly for their mistakes. But do not be put off by this, dying is part of the game, as is choosing when to return to the hub world to spend in game currency on upgrades which is collected through killing enemies. Combat is brutal and satisfying. The graphics are stunning and the many beasts you encounter are wonderfully grotesque. The game is addictive with that one more go feel before going to bed at 3am on a work night. The game has a lot of depth and a lot to master, newbies may find it difficult at first but anyone can progress with a bit of effort. I highly recommend this game to anyone who owns a PS4.

TimTeamTebow,"The game isn't bad, but it definitely falls short compared to dark souls 1/2. If you enjoy PvE content then bloodborne is great, but the PvP is lacking. PvP is very important to me, I don't see myself playing it much more in its current state. Graphics- The graphics are great. Its actually spooky at times, unlike dark souls 2. The only problem is that there is such little variety. Victorian era city, a forest, not really much else. The same goes for basic enemies, there just aren't that many different ones. It gets stale quickly. The design for bosses aren't that much better, although its a definite step up from dark souls 2 bosses. Solo PvE- Bloodborne definitely shines with this from a story perspective, but the gameplay falls a bit short. You have limited healing, but unlike previous souls games, they don't replenish after a bonfire/lamp visit. This means you are almost guaranteed to grind a bit on your first playthrough. Later on, you will get plenty of souls to buy them, so its not too bad. The same goes for the new bullets. The concept is great and very enjoyable, but you are likely to find yourself grinding for more bullets on your first playthrough. Blood echoes (the new souls) are in fairly limited supply early on. Early bosses only give a few thousand echoes. Coop PvE- Kinda a huge **** honestly. I don't know why nobody is pointing it out. In previous games, the boss would get a small buff to account for the extra player. Still, coop was helpful because it allowed you to swap aggro a bit, and sometimes speed up the fight. In bloodborne, your summon(s) get reduced health, but the bosses are left unchanged. Its very noticeable and I looked it up to be sure. What you get from this is every boss becomes a spanking. Just you and your pals run up and wail on the boss, which will stunlock most of them and take them down in 20-30 seconds. Not enjoyable. PvP- Another huge **** The invader has reduced health (30% less if I recall correctly). Aside from that, theres a lot of unbalanced stuff. Guns aren't really fun because they are no-risk parries that can also do a bit of damage. Theres not that much build variety, atleast not now and it could be because there are significantly less weapons. The new spells are terrible, they consume your limited bullets and are also just weak in general. As such, arcane is fairly weak. Most builds can just do vitality, endurance, and strength/skill.",6,2015-04-25,PLAYSTATION 4,user
quinsey117,"As a souls fan I stepped into Bloodborne feeling skeptical. The seemingly lack of weapons and armor alongside a lower amount of stats and options made me assume the game was rushed and unfinished. I feel almost ashamed to have thought this way now that ive beaten the game and by beaten the game I dont mean beat the final boss, I mean really beaten it. I received the platinum trophy roughly 2 weeks after getting the game and to my own amazement hardly ever putting it down. The game is alive with baddasery that made me feel like a dark hero. Uncovering secrets and masterying the skillset of the amazingly well crafted shifting weapons was as rewarding as the game is unforgiving. Souls games have always tested the players wits. Run in guns blazing and you will find yourself moping at the loading screen thinking ""this game ****"". But spend the time learning, searching, and planning and you start to find it laughable that you ever had a problem. I died only a handful of times by my third playthrough because the game becomes clockwork. You feel like an all knowing god that sees behind every corner and has no mercy for the foes that once haunted your every step. Bloodborne is as close to perfection as a game of its kind can be. With small hiccups like load times and a Deja vu seen this room before atmosphere to the chalice dungeons the game is just teetering on masterpiece. If you are a fan of souls games, a fan of a challenge, or just a fan of getting your face kicked in. Bloodborne is a game you wont soon forget.",9,2015-04-25,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Mewthree,"I'm going to start off by saying why are people so bad at giving reviews? People giving 0's for absolutely ridiculous reasons and 10's without even playing the whole game. I know this is how it's always been but that doesn't mean we can't improve. Now to the game itself. I'm not going to go too deeply into the pros since you can get a good view of them from everyone else's review. I'll just say that the difficulty, environment, enemy design and combat are very well done. The game is very enjoyable. Now to the cons/things the game should have: -About half of the bosses are too easy. Too easy meaning I beat them on my first or second try and this is my first ""Souls"" game. -The lack of gore. This game looks and feels like there should be some gore. Well, gore meaning limbs falling off etc. It would add to the immersion so much. -Chalice dungeons are way too repetitive and unrewarding. They are all basically the same. But the worst part is that you don't get almost any rewards that are worth your time. -Storytelling. I know the story is supposed to be ambiguous and that's a part of the charm. But the storytelling is just a bit too vague and leaves too much open to interpretation. -Lack of build variety. There are (almost) no spells and basically everyone's character behaves the same way. Dodging attacks and slashing with your weapon. -Lack of loot. Am I the only one who feels like the bosses should drop some actual gear? Well some kinda do, but that's way too rare. The game also needs more weapons and more armor sets. -Lack of build variety, loot and chalice dungeons being too repetitive results in poor ""endgame"" content/replayability. -Can't buy blood stone chunks after beating the game. Really? I listed a lot of cons, but overall they are pretty minor things. The game is, in my opinion, definitely the best PS4 game at the moment.",9,2015-04-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user
unluckydice,"Bloodborne (A Hunters Dream A Players Nightmare) After over a year of disappointing games for the next generation consoles thankfully the PS4 now has an exclusive worth wiping the dust of your console for. If your a fan of Demon souls and Dark Souls then you know what your getting yourself in for, if your not you may still find familiar ground that made you rage quit and never go back. Bloodborne is a game of unforgettable horror, unique environments, gameplay and relentless enemy's neither living nor dead. Bloodborne is a game that doesn't hold your hand or give you direction, and of course you will experience plenty of deaths like the previous Souls games that will make your bloodboil so just make sure you're in a well ventilated room... This is Bloodborne, a Dark Souls reskin I thought it may be maybe at it's core it is when your talking about overall gameplay, but when you progress through the games horrific enemy's and start exploring the outskirts of the city. Bloodborne is a whole new game on it's own. It's inner layer is unimaginable and will reward the player tenfold for making it through. Bloodborne is a truly unique next gen game with fast paced combat (similar to Devil May Cry mixed with Metal Gear Rising) stunning graphics and easier customization (menu screen, stats, weapon customization) make Bloodborne more appealing to a wider audience well just aaa small bit. Hidetaka Miyazaki (creator of the Souls franchise and Bloodborne) has embedded his footprint to create a Gothic vivid city filled with horror waiting to be explored that takes the player through the darkest hollows to the highest peaks. Bloodborne surely is an unforgettable experience and is one of the greatest sense of achievements you will ever experience in a video game that most hardcore gamers should endure. Perks It's a true next gen game Vivid Gothic rich setting Haunting soundtrack that sounds well... haunting Fast paced fluent combat that works well Great sense of accomplishment A less complicated setup compared to the Souls games weapons, custom stats, runes, leveling much easier to grasp and configure than the Souls games. Side stuff like dungeons and enemy's don't feel like side quests but rather like a main quest each is as unique Could easily spend a couple of hundred hours on it well worth the buck One of the greatest sense of achievements you will ever experience in a game video game Gameplay can take a while to master and depending on the boss or enemy you will have to adapt Negatives Most NPCs are either behind windows or don't say much Like Souls little lore on the front have to dwell through the games tough regime to discover its lore Slow Loading screens Some frame rates issues and enemy's glitches through the ground in certain areas Repetitive gameplay will not appeal to the wider gaming audience but does this matter?

Before I played it, I had become numb to how awesome it feels to beat a tough boss or a level that takes intelligence and perseverance to defeat; Bloodborne makes you feel like a [bloody] hero! It brings you back to the feel of the harder games of older generations but it has the awesome graphics and responsive controls of the PS4. Also with a patch coming very soon to shorten the loading times & optimize graphics, there's no excuse not to try this game out. There are some people who say this game is full of cheap deaths and we fans are mistaking difficulty for quality. Nothing could be further from the truth! There are no cheap deaths in Bloodborne; every single move & decision you make in your game has consequences. Whoever says that Bloodborne is too hard or is ""cheap"" hasn't given the game a chance. A million gamers can't be wrong; Bloodborne is the best-selling software for the month of March, despite the fact it was released at the near-end of the month! Don't listen to the extremely negative reviews from the butt-hurt n00b gamers; try this game for yourself! Finally I have to say that I was a total n00b before I started playing Bloodborne. I did struggle with it at first, but I was slaying beasts in no time! I'm so glad I didn't let my frustration get to me early in the game, because I ended-up falling in love with From Soft's game design.

jfinnegan,"This was my first go at a From Software game, and I was quite impressed. Bloodborne is essentially Dark Souls set in a gothic setting. You take the role of a hunter and are tasked with cleansing the streets of Yharnam. That is the story in a nutshell, as you play you will uncover what mysteries lie within Bloodborne's universe. First, the cons. Bloodborne is visually stunning. It is by far the most detailed game I have come across from the next gen consoles. The game runs at 30 frames per second with minor hiccups in the more visually dense sections. While the graphics are great it is in fact Bloodborne's gameplay that is its best quality. At first it will seem as if the developers are only out to punish you. I must have failed 20-30 times before I finally beat the first two bosses and moved past the first section. I enjoyed the challenge of the game, but it might throw some people off. Now the cons. Bloodborne has two major problems. First, the load times. The load times can take up to 45 seconds to a minute. This can take the player out of the experience and even punish them if they are stuck on a boss. The second problem for me at least is the lack of story. For the most part you are left alone to figure out the story, and it can be quite subliminal. For those looking to figure out exactly what's going on it would be wise to read up on wikis if you wish to. Overall a very good game and worth a buy. If I could give halves it would be an 8.5.",8,2015-04-22,PLAYSTATION 4,user
thukon,"Never played DS or DS2, but I found Bloodborne to be an amazing game. Bare minimum tutorial (which still required me to do some mild exploring before I even found it) which just tells you the basic controls. The very first enemies you face are as hard as the ones you face throughout the rest of the game. Cryptic notes are left on the ground by other unseen PS4 players, warning you about a giant beast or ambush ahead. I spent several hours in the very first area; frustrated, I consulted a strategy guide with tips. Overall, the entire game (mechanics and all) felt just like Yharnam. Cold, unforgiving, diverse, and almost impossible to tackle without advice from other players. I get apprehensive every time I spawn again and venture off into a new, unexplored section of the map. If you like to be coddled through campaigns or want a story driven game, this simply isn't for you. Bloodborne is a frustrating challenge, driven by raw atmosphere and gameplay.

Kawooster,"Bloodborne is a very fun and satisfying game. Leveling up and upgrading is definitely one of the key factors. It makes you want to keep playing, so you can be that little bit stronger. Just like the souls series. But, something you will realize when you pick up Bloodborne, is how large of an upgrade it actually is, compared to the souls series. The graphics are far more polished, the motion is much more fluid, all in all it's a huge upgrade. The bosses and enemies are another thing that I loved, compared to with some of the others in previous games, the bosses felt a lot more thought out. With that all said, no game is perfect. The one thing that annoyed me most was, ""the story"" it didn't tell you anything, I know these types of games are not meant to exactly have a story line, but then it shouldn't pretend to, and if it wants one, at least explain it to some extent. Dark Souls 2 didn't exactly have a story, but it still made sense. Where this one made no sense what so ever, to me, anyway. Another thing are the controls. Man! did they get annoying at times. It felt a lot more fluid than previous games but it was still rough and very frustrating, especially on the boss battles. The game it's self feels much more linear than previous games. While this wasn't a bad thing, it definitely gave you a sense of claustrophobia compared to the previous games. With those points said, Bloodborne is definitely the greatest in the franchise so far. It is a fun and entertaining challenge, but nothing more than that. It definitely does not deserve a 10. People need to realize that games getting a 10 have to be perfect, with out fault. This is not that game, but all in all, It's a fun game and deserves an 8.",8,2015-04-20,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Demota,"First of all I must convey that I am a Souls saga fan. I extremely enjoyed each game of FROM Software. This newest game is quite enjoyable but annoying. It has beautiful graphics: I specially loved old women path in the forest, all over the roofs. Spectacular!! But it is a complete non sense in story and the drop make the game stupid comparing the previous games. I know it is not a souls game but... really? all drop is abusing repetitive. It's a loop of drop every time you go farming. No secrets available!! no secret doors.. no mimics.. no secret paths or npcs!! all NPCs are necessary for nothing! you could kill everyone (I rectify, there are some of them that are un-killable) It is extremely short and the bosses are ultra easy, and no, I dont play 12h in a row to get easy mode. They kill you yes, some of them. Even 5 or 6 times maybe the worst but that's no the FROM Software game feeling that I was used to reach. I am very dissapointed. The game was adapted for the comercial public and for the IDONTKNOWHOWTOREACHTHATPOINTORDOTHATTHING players... its a pitty. However the game is great so there goes my 8. Notable, no further. Regards to everyone",8,2015-04-20,PLAYSTATION 4,user

ZalgoFinality,"By now, just about everyone has seen the commercials for the Playstation 4 exclusive Bloodborne. But, on the assumption that someone is unfamiliar with the overarching concept of the game, Bloodborne is a Victorian-era spin on From Soft’s Dark and Demon’s Souls series of games, which pride themselves on difficulty and perseverance. It has the usual From Software approach to storytelling, of not saying a whole lot and leaving you to figure out basically everything. Or nothing at all, depending upon the player, and how they view the world. But what is common knowledge of the storyline, is that you are a Hunter, and Hunters hunt the monsters that appear on the night of the Hunt. And that’s pretty much all I can say that is one hundred percent accurate. Firstly, let me say that if this is your first foray into a Souls game, which it effectively is, same developer, and same general plot device for respawning, pick another one. If you want the absolute Souls experience, start with Dark Souls, then proceed to Dark Souls 2, and then Bloodborne. The gameplay, putting it lightly, is rather breakneck in Bloodborne, and opposed to most other games where you face downright terrifying odds, as a Hunter, you are to put aggression before defense. This is aided some by being able to heal most of the damage you have just taken by swinging a few times at the nearest enemy. Which, seems to just get me into even more trouble. That being said, I do like that From Soft is trying out new ideas, instead of the tank-fest that Dark Souls, and Dark Souls 2 usually are on first playthroughs. But, coming off of about four-hundred hours on the other two games I’ve mentioned plenty of times by now, it is a little too jarring of a change for me. The incredible change in speed in exacerbated even further in the player versus player function in the game, which basically boils down to two people rolling madly at each other, and occasionally hitting the attack button. Visually, the game is about as excellent as anyone could hope it to be. Vast, towering cathedrals loom just out of reach, while claustrophobic buildings hark towards the sky all around you. The monsters are visually fresh, and downright terrifying when they surprise you. You’re walking down a narrow path towards where you’ve been vaguely directed to go, and bam, suddenly, a werewolf is gnawing on your right shoulder. Not to mention the bosses being some of the most impressive, albeit not too original, fights I’ve had in any game to date. When your first boss is a Wendigo the size of a double-decker bus flipped on its tail, and that’s the least impressive boss you’ve got, you’re doing something right. And about two-thirds of the way through the game, it gets even more intense, and takes a turn from Edgar Allen Poe inspired, over to Lovecraftian Horrors. Which I would happily say is a good step from the usual knight in shining armor routine From Soft usually goes with. Sound design is very pleasant, and works very well with the feelings of the game. Whether the satisfying boom of the blunderbuss, the sound of blood splattering over your character, and his weapon, or the not-quite-right roar of some monster just outside of your sight, it all very much works with the game. Now, in pure comparison to Dark Souls 2, the most recent release from From Soft, prior to Bloodborne, the long and short of it is, I would prefer Dark Souls 2. Visually, my heart goes to Bloodborne, the bosses are just so much more interesting, but only by the thinnest margin, as nothing can beat the purely stunning aesthetics of a doomed castle. Story goes to Dark Souls 2, simply because we have more information to draw from in that game, due to its three expansions, and Bloodborne is very much a difficult-to-decipher game. Gameplay, to Dark Souls, I am a fan of the slower, more methodical pace that happens without the inclusion of firearms. Sound, Bloodborne, again by a tiny margin, the bosses just sound more intimidating, and unnerving in some situations. In finality, Bloodborne is another stellar game in the From Soft library. The gameplay is stellar, visuals stunning, and storyline as difficult to figure out as anything else they’ve made. If you like a challenge, and I mean challenge, with a capital ‘c’, and are a fan of Victorian-era monsters, this is definitely something you should be on the lookout for. Sixty dollars is more than fair for a game of this caliber, which has the capabilities to hold people’s attentions for years, and years. It may not be the finest entry into the “Souls” library, but it is definitely one that deserves to be there, and is definitely worth the sixty dollar price tag.",9,2015-04-19,PLAYSTATION 4,user
loadstone007,"This is an incredible game, however only specific gamers will appreciate it. The game is incredibly hard and demands a steep investment of game time in order to beat it (~40-60 hours). So if you don't like very hard games that demand a lot of repetition and time, skip it. If you're open to it, you'll find an incredible game that's just a game of the year contender.",10,2015-04-19,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Remrrg,Bloodborne is a fantastic game with tons of replayability. It is one of the best games that came out from From Software studios. If you have a PS4 I recommend to pick up this game.,10,2015-04-18,PLAYSTATION 4,user
ShadowXyo,"Simply fantastic game, if you love Action RPGs, amazing game design and music, then this is the game for you! Don't be put off by what people say about the difficulty curve, it just takes a bit to get used to, when you get past 3 or 4 bosses you get the hang of it, the atmosphere is insanely good and immersive, it has a few technical flaws(such as long loading screens and some frame rate drops but nothing too major, I've been a fan of the soul series from the beginning, and I was not surprised when I found that this game was really good, thank you From Software for yet another unbelievably enjoyable game!",10,2015-04-18,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Zlatan,"To begin with I was thinking that all bad reviews on this were given by xboots and pc drones. So just got the game and tried it for my self. Shock..... The game is like from 2008. The graphics ,sound ,load times it looks like it was designed for ps3 and ported to ps4. I usually do not care about graphics even if the game is good. But.. Everything **** here. Controls are inaccurate, voice, acting is so bad it's funny, story is nonexistent in the beginning and it just feels like a bad game. And then we come to how hard the game is. But this is subjective. Some people like hard games and this is fine but for me it is so hard that I feel it is wasting my time. I feel I would rather look at something else. Maybe videos of uncharted 4,Witcher or the new star wars game and reminding my self that we are in 2015 not 2008.....",0,2015-04-17,PLAYSTATION 4,user
sscott0829tw,"GAME OF THE YEAR!! Bloodborne has done so well in everything, nice story telling,challenging combat,badass enemy design,gorgeous map with old UK style buildings. Of course,people amateur gamer will hate this game because it is too hard. But it is a damn great game because it is difficult. makes you greedy on every moves,every dodge and attack. NPC and side missions are well made,lots of fun weapons to collect and use. I think Bloodborne is even better than dark souls 1 and 2. and I think it's the GOTY.",9,2015-04-17,PLAYSTATION 4,user

tiagoandrade,"I've never played a Souls game before and I'm loving this game. The gameplay is fluid and rewarding. The atmosphere and level design are just fantastic! You can play it for 50 hours if you willing to do some good exploration. In terms of story, the thing is that you have to conquer the lore piece by piece trough the game: read the items descriptions and pay very attention to the dialogues, check out the community's theories. Its very open to interpretation but is great. The game has a difficulty level slighly above the average, but its rewarding and challeging, not frustrating. I'm really excited know to play the Soul's series. The only complaints that i have about Bloodborne is the long load time every time you die (about 40 sec sometimes) and the frame rate drops in some areas or when doing coop. Because of this technical problems, my rate for it would be 9.5. But once FromSoftware has promised to fix this issues at the present month, and due to a lot a people being really unfair to this game here, the final rate is going to be a solid 10.",10,2015-04-17,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Silverstrad,"I found this game frustrating until I realized it wants you to play smart, not play the hero. If you find yourself hung up in the same area for a long time, try reconsidering your approach. Boss fights are challenging and very rewarding, the creeping terror atmosphere has yet to get stale, aesthetically beautiful and mechanically very tight. It's refreshing for a game to have fantastic content and yet not try and cram it down your throat.",10,2015-04-17,PLAYSTATION 4,user
bioshocker34,"If any of you guys are like me and feel things have been rather dull with new releases in the triple AAA game industry then go and do yourself and favor and GET THIS GAME. Theirs so much that can be said about this game, the atmosphere and the world is one of the most enthralling and mind blowing things I've ever seen. The multi-player system is the best I've experienced in a long time. It's this awesome community that can only communicate through helpful notes on the ground and gestures and it's so elegant and free from call of duty shinnanigins. The level design is one of the most brilliant things I've ever seen, The combat is breathtaking the shaking you get in your hands as you fight a boss and it's getting down to the wire and the sight of raining blood and PREY SLAUGHTERED nothing has ever felt so good. Then all the secret areas that you can easily never find it's amazing how much effort was put into this game and there is a story you just gotta dig and fill in blanks yourself. Don't let the difficulty or any experience you've had with past souls games shy you away. Hell it might even make you get the souls games and end up wanting to play them.( speaking from experience) Theirs so much more that can be said but i'll leave that to you to pick it up and play. i'd give it a 9.5 if i could but seeing as you cant do that guess i gotta round up though its well deserved.",10,2015-04-17,PLAYSTATION 4,user
joeblack,"An amazing game for sure. The storytelling is a bit underwhelming compared to its spiritual predecessors (the souls games), and so it the PvP. The load time are atrocious (but should be fixed soon in a patch), and are by far the biggest obstacle you'll face in the entire game. Difficulty is on par with the souls games in general (DS2 is easier, though, and Bloodborne is only truly tough in the chalice dungeons). The atmosphere, graphics and sound are simply spectacular. While the level design is not as entwined as that of Demon's Souls or DS1, it is still quite awesome. If you love the souls games but isn't a franchise fanatic, you'll absolutely love this game, if you don't like any of the souls games at all, you'll probably be better off having a pass on this one. If you're a souls fanatic, and not just a long time fan of the franchise, you'll generally love the NG experience and hate on a lot of things afterwards. This will mainly be due to nostalgia, but also, at least in some small part, because you've got nothing better to do than to cap crap at random people on the Internet :) Hope this was helpful.",9,2015-04-17,PLAYSTATION 4,user

CertifiedGamer,This game proves why Sony knows how to make masterpiece smash hit games that then become classics. This game shows the power of next gen consoles as the graphics are beautiful. The game is challenging and I do not regret buy it. I know this is the game is dashingly gothic like a next century symphony of the night meets the purge meets dark souls.

carbinePRO,"This game is incredible! I've only played Dark Souls once, and I didn't really get into it. I wish that I had so that way I would've been more prepared for this epic game. Bloodborne, I believe, is the killer app for the PS4. If you have a PS4, and you don't have this game already, you're nuts! I don't want to spoil anything because this game is utterly incredible, and needs to be experienced in order to really appreciate it. From Software did good on this one. This is honestly one of the best games I have ever played. It's fun, addicting, and feels rewarding when you get passed those really difficult parts you've been attempting for hours. The first thing you see in the game are its visuals. Holy crap are they good! The environments are so lively and proportionately lit that it feels almost real. The co-op in this game is also fantastic. Beckoning you friend to join your world, and help you kill the dang Blood-Starved Beast (if you've fought it, you'll know what I mean) is a cooperative experience unlike anything thing I've seen in previous games. This game deserves all the praise it's getting. Again, I implore anybody that owns a PS4 to buy this game. I guarantee that you will have zero regrets for this purchase.",10,2015-04-16,PLAYSTATION 4,user

GamerJosh0137,"Lets see, where to start. I am having trouble coming up with the right words to describe how much I love Bloodborne, and how playing Bloodborne makes me feel. It's a feeling that i have not had in a long long time, probably not since since Super Metroid on snes. First off, I feel like Bloodborne in itself is a compliment to all gamers. It really shows how much From Software respects us. Sure it is very difficult and extremely punishing, but that is most of what makes it fun. They don't tell you what to do, where to go, who to kill, who not to kill, how to kill, etc. You are not spoon fed ANYTHING. You also wouldn't know the whole base of the story unless you look real hard to find explanations. I think this is because From Software developers know that gamers are a smart people and do not like to be patronized. HAha. The best thing about Bloodborne for me is the high I get when I finally beat a boss or get past a part that I tried over and over and over again. I was somewhat lucky in the sense that I have never played any of the souls games so I had no expectations going in. However, most of the reviews I have seen from people who DO play the souls games still love it. I highly suggest this game to anyone who wants to stand outside of the box for a real challenge. DO NOT buy this game if you like mindless fps that take a day to finish. :-) My one and only gripe, and why I gave this game a 9 instead of a ten is the time it takes to load after dying. I don't care how good you are, you are going to die A LOT. That is ok, but there is about a 1 minute loading time before you re-awaken. It doesn't sound long but if you lost a lot of blood echoes (you will understand what blood echoes are once you play the game) it feels like an eternity. P.S. There will probably be a time at the beginning of the game that you think about quitting the game completely because of one part you cant get passed. This is what happened to me, but DON'T QUIT. Once you get passed the first barrier you will slowly but surely chip away little by little. The feeling of triumph you will have is incredible. Like legal heroin.

AttentiveCritic,"So I couldn't input my full review up on here because of the 5000 max characters **** along with the lack of editing feature up on Metacritic so I'll just say that I enjoyed Bloodborne but it's nowhere near a a 9 or an 8. The game is far too repetitive and the combat is too simple and stoic to be fully enjoyable but it's still a good game no less. Metacritic, you guys seriously need to cut this 5000 max characters crap and make it so that users can edit their review without having to copy/paste the original. **** ridiculous, that I took half an hour and typed over 8 pages on Microsoft word for my review on this game with sections spaced out for things such as ""Presentation"", ""Gameplay"", and ""Music"" and when I paste it on the site, the formatting is all **** up. You can't be as expressive on Amazon but at least you can **** get all of what you want to say out on any given product. Oh and now this site is automatically sensoring F bombs, great. Perhaps I should just start a blog or something. Between this and Amazon, this lack of expressive freedom is killing me. **** you Metacritic, **** you Amazon.",7,2015-04-16,PLAYSTATION 4,user
howler77,"Bloodborne is the rare game that restores a hard core gamer's faith. there's no obnoxious tutorial, there's no silly story and stereotypical characters being shoved down your throat. the story is there if you look for it, but Bloodborne is all about the game. Learning how to overcome each challenge, and become deadlier than the creatures that at first seem impossible is truly satisfying. It's an experience that not many games can provide. Bloodborne is a masterpiece marred by a few forgivable flaws. The frame rate could be better, as well as the load times. The rag doll physics are pretty silly. The better you get at the game, the less you'll die, and see the loading screen. Casual gamers and people who are easily frustrated should pick a different game. All the 0/10 scores here are ridiculous. These are the people with no patience who got their ass kicked and gave up.",9,2015-04-16,PLAYSTATION 4,user
ZKowalsky,"Exciting and bloody RPG that totally gives to the player a perfect experience of being in the XVIII's London (but with wirewolves and some other rude guys) while he's playing a killing blow. However, the game is not cool for everybody, and many people could get angry dying and exploring Yharnam. If you don't like to explore a city and the pressure to get killed by somebody, that's not you game. If you love a classic RPG mechanics and hard fights, don't think more about it: just go to the next games shop, buy a PS4 if you don't have one and buy 1 or 238 copies of Bloodborne just 'cause you're going to enjoy it like mad.",9,2015-04-16,PLAYSTATION 4,user
