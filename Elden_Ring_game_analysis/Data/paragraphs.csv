paragraph
"In a similar way to how Obsidian's The Outer Worlds played very closely to a space-faring Fallout, Avowed sticks closely to the sensibilities of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Its fantasy world isn't as expansive and seamlessly stitched together, but you'd be forgiven for confusing the two at a glance, especially when you're engaged in its first-person combat. Avowed lifts some of the best aspects of the seminal RPG and improves them, especially when it comes to its refined combat. These changes extend to a move away from traditional leveling in favor of a gear-focused approach, as well as the option to experiment with wild weapon combinations. But not all of Avowed's experiments are successes, leading to an uneven role-playing adventure that surprises as much as it frustrates."
"Washing up on the shores of the Living Lands, you play as one the Godlike: a select few kissed by the grace of a god at birth and left with some distinct (and sometimes frightening) facial features to show for it. On a mission from a distant monarch whose influence within the Living Lands has many of its inhabitants up in arms, your job is to track down the source of a plague that's turning the land's people into mindless, bloodthirsty creatures, before it manages to make it back home. Although it is set in the same universe as Pillars of Eternity, Avowed does a good job of immediately siloing you into an area that requires little knowledge of what is happening across the ocean, but does reference some historical events from time to time. A glossary of important names and places is available as they're brought up in conversation, providing a handy guide that contextualizes some attitudes characters have to certain factions and events around you."
"Avowed makes a strong initial impression, quickly establishing your Godlike status but with the odd quirk of being the first not to know which god chose you. This isn't the main purpose of your mission, but that changes after a surprising event in the early hours of the game that sets the stage for a more intriguing answer to the plague ravaging the Living Lands. This setup is ultimately squandered, however, with the two big narrative hooks coalescing with one another in routinely expected and uninteresting ways, making the broader strokes of the story largely forgettable. The conversational writing does have its moments of charm, with equally serious and snarky retorts letting you inject some levity into otherwise dire situations with great comedic effect. But the severity of the plague you're trying to stop and the personal journey of finding out why you're the only Godlike without a god is not as captivating as it could be, taking steps along a narrative path that rarely deviates into surprising avenues."
"Your choices shape parts of the world around you and dictate some directions the story goes, and these do manifest in some interesting ways. A character I saved from a cell in the first hour of the game reappeared hours later to help me complete another side quest without having to pay a large sum of money or resort to violence. The reappearance was surprising but natural, slotting a character into a pack of bandits that would've otherwise been a problem if not for me showing some compassion hours earlier."
"Another instance saw me also avoiding a confrontation by playing some side quests in a specific order, with the conclusion of one (and the choice I made at the end of it) unlocking some dialogue options in a latter part of the chain that guided the conversation down an amicable path. These moments stand out particularly because of how naturally they occur, giving your actions a sense of place in the world without having to signpost instances where your choices may or may not matter. This applies to the main quest too, albeit with more distinct black-and-white choices. These are clear forks in the road that determine reactions from characters around you, but their binary nature makes them less elegant (and thus, less interesting)."
"Core to some of Avowed narrative failings are its uninteresting companions. Kai, the first you encounter in the game's opening hour, joins your plight after little more than an introductory conversation, and very quickly is devoted to the cause without enough time to establish why. Others, like the animancer Giatta and quirky mage Yatzli, have more recognizable motivations when joining your party, but none of the four in total stand out as particularly interesting or complex. They're far more exciting in what they bring to the experience in terms of combat and abilities, but never manage to drum up the same interest in their backstories and evolving relationship with your character."
"Avowed moves you between a handful of hubs throughout its narrative, which are all visually varied and stunning to look at. The inviting forestry and idyllic coasts of Dawnshore contrast the desolate deserts of Shatterscarp, with eye-catching pops of color and warm lighting inviting you to take in the sights around you. These areas act as large hubs that you can explore freely once unlocked, each with their own faction-aligned city to explore, side quests to undertake, and secrets to uncover. Getting around in Avowed is surprisingly satisfying thanks to a keen sense of verticality to exploration. It leverages a simple, yet effective, platforming system that lets you reliably make daring jumps and last-ditch lunges towards an inviting ledge to mantle up onto. This is emphasized by some straightforward but nonetheless fun platforming puzzles strewn around the map, often with either interesting loot or great views at the end. Avowed eschews the janky platforming of its influences with something that feels more purposeful, and its world is designed incredibly well to support it."
"Avowed lifts some of the best aspects of the seminal RPG and improves them ... but not all of Avowed's experiments are successes, leading to an uneven role-playing adventure that surprises as much as it frustrates"
"This sense of refinement translates to Avowed's combat, which again feels like an improvement over its clear influences. You're offered a variety of options when building your offensive arsenal, from standard swords and shields to dual-wielding magical grimoires and elemental muskets. Avowed entices experimentation with numerous weapons by offering two loadouts that can be swapped between at any time, letting you switch from up-and-close slashes to ranged spellcasting with the press of a button. Action feels crunchy and impactful, too: An axe feels like it's burying itself into the enemies at the unfortunate end of your swings, while magical explosions shower the screen with eye-catching effects that emphasize their power. Slight pauses when executing powerful finishers (once you've whittled down an enemy's stamina bar) lets you revel in the violence, even if other actions such as parrying don't feel as tightly animated and satisfying to consistently pull off. Combining your unlockable abilities with the varied ones companions bring to the table gives combat a layer of complexity that is satisfying to engage with."
"The feedback that combat offers entices you to see how each weapon type works and looks in a skirmish, which makes it surprising that so few are found in chests, offered as quest rewards, or just lay strewn around the map. Merchants offer opportunities to purchase new weapons but at heavily inflated prices, forcing you to use what you're lucky enough to get your hands on. It's fun to make some combinations work--using a sword and pistol makes for exciting combat that lets you deal lots of damage but forces you to evade a lot too--but ability upgrades stifle that, encouraging you instead to prioritize specific weapon types. These upgrades are ones you'd find in a traditional RPG where you're building toward a specific build, rather than ones that encourage you to make weird but interesting combinations work. It's difficult to make some of Avowed's most-interesting combinations synergize when it's far more effective to stick to one-handed weapons and buff their damage and critical chances, instead of spreading your limited ability points across multiple types that make you a jack of all trades."
"Worse still is the imbalance in Avowed's progression that further reduces your options when constructing a viable class. Instead of scaling enemies with traditional numerical levels, foes are instead defined by the tier of gear they're wearing. In order to take on more challenging enemies, which come thick and fast as you progress from one hub to another, you need to continually upgrade your own equipment. The big problem is just how scarce most crafting materials are, making it difficult to keep just one piece of armor and two weapons up to date with the enemy scaling around you. Merchants are equally greedy with materials as they are with new weapons, giving you few options to continue trying to get your existing equipment to a new, higher tier or expediting the process with a new weapon entirely. This further pushes you into focusing on just one weapon type and class, to the point where the second loadout became completely irrelevant before I found myself halfway through my journey."
"Although doing side-quests help with accruing money, quest rewards do little to help with the grind for materials. For the most part the payouts don't put a dent in the large price tags on the most-exclusive offerings from merchants, while equipment rewards rarely fill the gap. Finding a weapon with unique attributes is often a bittersweet one, given how hard it is to pivot from your existing loadout that you've already committed to upgrading and potentially restarting that process at your current tier with new gear. You can choose to respec for a flat fee, letting you rebuild your class around a new, higher tier weapon, but you have to be equally careful doing this too given how difficult it is to accrue a meaningful gold balance. Even if you prioritize side quests and as much optional content as possible in each of Avowed's hubs, it's never nearly enough to prevent your companions from screaming the same barks during combat pleading with you to upgrade your armor and weapons to survive."
"It turns the impactful combat into drawn-out skirmishes where you're vulnerable to a quick flurry of attacks while slowly chipping away at an enemy. Large groups become incredibly dangerous when even just one or two enemies are a few gear levels above your own due to the time it takes to dispatch them and how easily they can flatten you. Combat encounters also scale in a manner that suggests you should be keeping up with ease, as larger waves flood skirmishes and quickly overwhelm you and your two companions in tow. Checkpoints are not as forgiving as you might expect, sometimes throwing you back multiple encounters that you might have tediously slogged through just to have to suffer through them again. These hurdles were prevalent on the game's default Normal difficulty setting, with a total of five to choose from at any time. I tested what impact knocking things down to Easy had and although it improved my odds at survival in many late-game battles, it still didn't alleviate the tedium of whittling down enemies with vastly superior gear. Avowed doesn't owe you a straightforward power fantasy, but it is woefully balanced currently, to the point of persistent frustration."
"On multiple fronts, Avowed holds so much promise that it struggles to follow through on. While its combat feels impactful and gives you options to experiment with, it's hamstrung by an overall reliance on gear upgrades and scarce resources that prevent you from fully enjoying the creative freedom it initially advertises. Its world is fun to explore and navigate, but its story fails to wrap this in a captivating tale with a satisfying conclusion. It's an experience that routinely swaps between exhilarating moments and frustrating slogs, and often leans towards the latter the closer you get to the game's climax. Avowed might present itself as the new age of the fantasy role-playing games that it borrows so much from, but it's unlikely to have the same lasting impact."
"There is no game series out there that means more to me than Virtua Fighter. I spent my weekly allowance to play VF and VF2 in arcades, cavorted cross-country in search of rare Virtua Fighter 3 cabinets, and eventually connected with overseas friends by playing VF4 Evolution and Final Tuned in Japan. So when I see a new--or new-ish, in this case--Virtua Fighter game get released, I want it to be the best it can possibly be. Not just for myself, but so others can pick it up and understand why we longtime Virtua Fighter players adore these games so much."
"Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown--released a few years back on PS4--was a solid attempt at this, bringing the much-loved VF5 Final Showdown to PS4 with a fresh coat of paint. However, it fumbled in some key areas--particularly the netcode, which was a bizarre delay-based system in an era when fighting game developers were quickly and vocally embracing superior rollback systems. Now, with a new Virtua Fighter in active development and people talking about the series again, Sega has given us Virtua Fighter 5 REVO: another revision exclusively for PCs with the much-longed-for and player-demanded rollback netcode."
"The rollback netcode is clearly the major selling point here, as much of the game is still built upon the foundation of VF5 Ultimate Showdown: The menu graphics, interface, and character models are largely the same, with a bit of extra polish and visual flair if you've got solid graphics hardware. But that's fine--those areas didn't need much improvement, so why fix what isn't broken?"
"So yes, it's (almost) all about the netcode this time around, and thankfully, Sega has nailed it… mostly. It's absolutely the best netcode a Virtua Fighter game has ever had, which makes it far more playable and appealing. In my sessions, I've had smooth matches with folks as far away as Japan, the Philippines, and the UK from my home in the US Pacific Northwest. Some bouts required adjusting the amount of rollback frames slightly, but many were just fine on default settings. When conditions are ideal, playing online is practically indistinguishable from playing against an opponent locally--aside from the occasional odd side effect of rollback, such as hearing a counter hit noise only to realize that no, the rollback kicked in and that wasn't actually a counter, whoops."
"But that's when conditions are ideal. For an ""old"" fighting game, Virtua Fighter 5 REVO is surprisingly demanding on its default graphics settings. So if you get the game and just jump right into online play without fiddling around with the settings first, odds are your frame rate is going to start dipping under 60fps. That's a big problem, because when someone's frame rate is inconsistent, the netcode has to work extra hard, and it results in a choppy, stuttering experience for both sides, even if the other player's setup is running fine. A benchmark test before going online to make sure everyone has a consistent 60fps would do wonders in smoothing out the experience, but for now, the only thing that can be done is to ask players to spend time adjusting graphics settings from the get-go."
"This release also marks the first major revision of the core gameplay in roughly 12 years, with attacks from older games added back in, the properties of many existing moves changed, and character's weights adjusted, among other things. These aren't really changes that make for major selling points, but they do affect the moment-to-moment fighting gameplay in ways that are both subtle and drastic: Characters like Jacky and Taka-Arashi, considered very strong in the previous version, have been knocked down a couple pegs with some of the (now less) lightweight characters like Pai feeling much improved. This is probably the most balanced this game has ever been. (It's worth noting that these gameplay changes have also been patched into VF5 Final Showdown.)"
"The fact that these small changes can shake things up so drastically is part of what makes Virtua Fighter 5, in all its incarnations, so great to play competitively. Learning Virtua Fighter is a long, challenging, and incredibly satisfying journey. VF's skill ceiling is extremely high: You can play for years and still discover new, exciting, and fascinating aspects of the combat each time you dive in. Combat is lightning-fast and involves constant decision-making, with almost every situation having numerous possible answers. It feels like learning a new language, with the fights themselves being your canvas for expression."
"Of course, not everyone wants to play competitively, and unfortunately VF5 REVO still suffers from the dearth of single-player content that Ultimate Showdown did. There's still a severe lack of character customization options as well: The PS3 and Xbox 360 release of VF5 Final Showdown had a wealth of weird and wild items to deck characters out with for combat, and both REVO and VF5US have only a fraction of that--and much of it is currently locked behind DLC. There's always a chance there's more customization coming, however."
"There's a tavern in the town of Troskowitz where the barmaids must be sick at the sight of me. I've been there twice, and both times been involved in messy brawls despite not tasting a lick of alcohol. The second of these fisticuffs was against a small group of Cuman deserters. They seemed nice enough, but I was still wary considering the Cumans are who killed my parents a few months back. I wasn't the only one, and after failing to ease the growing tension, I decided to side with the local townspeople when push came to shove."
"Needless to say, we didn't put up much of a fight. Once the Cumans left, one of the locals implored me to track them down and deal with them once and for all. After eventually tracking them down, the sole Czech-speaking Cuman was so welcoming that I ended up getting drunk with them. I got so inebriated, in fact, that my night revolved around almost drowning, playing matchmaker for one of the soldiers, and then having a conversation with a talking dog that definitely wasn't real. This night of revelry would've been fine on any other evening, but I promised two new acquaintances that I'd be up bright and early to join them on a critical mission. Even after sleeping for seven hours, I was still completely plastered when I arose from my stupor. And let me tell you, fighting bandits with blurred vision, a swaying body, and a soundtrack of frequent farting isn't ideal."
"To some, this last part might sound utterly infuriating. To me, and others like me, this is part of what makes Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 utterly enticing. This is a game that sings when you're swept up in an entertaining series of events ignited by the consequences of your actions; where the game's quest design and emphasis on player choice wonderfully intertwine with its systems-driven sandbox to create a wholly immersive experience. While its 2018 predecessor was often disrupted by technical issues--which were further exacerbated by a frustrating save system--and clunky combat, Kingdom Come 2 refines and improves upon it in every respect. The obtuse nature of some of its RPG systems still won't click for everybody, but this is a confident sequel that builds on the foundations established by the original game, presenting a rich and sprawling adventure that effortlessly oscillates between medieval drama and slice-of-life hijinks in a world that feels distinctly alive."
"Set in Bohemia during the early 15th century, Kingdom Come 2 picks up right where the first game left off. You're Henry of Skalitz, a humble blacksmith's son who's still trying to retrieve his murdered father's sword from the sniveling noble who stole it--and also happens to be working for the other side in the region's ongoing civil war. You begin the game as the handsomely equipped bodyguard of your pal, Sirs Hans Capon, but it doesn't take long before things go awry and you're left with little except for a few new scars. From here, Kingdom Come 2 is all about building yourself back up in whichever way you see fit. Will your Henry possess a silver tongue and scholarly knowledge? Will he be a skilled swordsman capable of defeating knights and bandits alike? A thief or a devout Christian? A drunken brawler or a master of apothecary? The most likely outcome is some confluence of all of the above, but the choice is entirely yours. Kingdom Come 2 is designed to accommodate the type of Henry you want to be, with the rest of Bohemia taking note and reacting in kind."
"Every action you take feeds into the game's robust progression system, where you get better at each discipline the more often you do it. Studying specific books for a few hours can expedite the process, but your proficiency with a sword will primarily improve by wielding one in battle, either in life-or-death skirmishes or friendly training duels. There are four primary stats to level up--strength, agility, vitality, and speech--but also numerous skills to master, from survival and thievery to craftsmanship and horsemanship. As the level of your stats and skills rise, you gain access to myriad perks that improve your capabilities even further. This might be something simple, like dodges in combat costing 40% less stamina, or something more significant, such as the ability to stealthily knock people out by putting them in a chokehold. Some of these can only be learned by certain characters teaching you--such as an expert thief letting you in on the secrets of pickpocketing--and the same is true of combos for the various weapon types you can equip. This creates an intuitive and tactile sense of progression where improvement isn't predicated on simply watching numbers increase, but by learning and doing."
"This is well demonstrated by the art of persuasion. You can solve even the most dire of situations by using Henry's gift of the gab to reason with the other party. Depending on who you're talking to, there are numerous ways to try resolving matters, such as peaceful means, issuing threats, lying, and so on. While speech is a stat you can level up like any other, it's also influenced by a number of additional factors, such as your appearance and reputation. If you're trying to come across as a hero and protector of the weak, you'll want to be wearing a suit of armor to convincingly pull it off. Wearing noble attire will accentuate your charisma--provided you're not covered in blood and filth. Mercifully, you can save up to three different outfits, quickly swapping between them like a chameleon, depending on the situation. Your attire can be advantageous or disadvantageous when it comes to stealth, too. Wearing dark clothes is preferable when sneaking around at night, while it's inadvisable to wear armor plates due to the rattle each footstep emits."
"If you're caught breaking and entering, you'll be greeted by the stiff arm of the law that is Kingdom Come 2's fleshed-out crime system. You don't even have to be caught red-handed to land yourself in trouble. If a valuable item goes missing or someone is murdered in their sleep and you were spotted lurking around the area beforehand, NPCs are smart enough to deduce that you might've had something to do with it. You can attempt to talk your way out of these situations, opt to pay a fine, accept your punishment, or try to run away. Depending on the severity of your crime, there are four possible punishments on hand, from spending a few days in the pillory to being painfully branded on the side of the neck. Each form of punishment makes it challenging to converse with people until the effect wears off or you decide to embark on a pilgrimage to atone for your sins. These consequences are impactful and ensure that each picked lock and stint of trespassing is fraught with tension, particularly because Kingdom Come 2's contentious save system remains unchanged from the first game."
"You can only save your progress by consuming a potion of Savior Schnapps or by sleeping in a bed you either own or have rented for the night. There are auto saves during quests, and you have the option to save and quit, but you're otherwise limited on when and how often you can save the game. Savior Schnapps can be found, bought, or brewed, but there's no way to save on the spot if you run out. The idea behind this is to eliminate save scumming, forcing you to live with the consequences of your actions. In the first game, however, the intent behind it was undermined by the prevalence of bugs and other technical issues, with some potentially wiping away hours of progress. Fortunately, Kingdom Come 2 is unlike its predecessor by being near-faultless in this regard. Playing on PC, I've not encountered any broken quests or game-breaking bugs in over 65 hours of playtime. I've witnessed a few visual hiccups, like characters clipping through tables or floating in the air, but these moments are relatively rare and constitute the extent of the game's technical issues, in my experience."
"This is a confident sequel that builds on the foundations established by the original game, presenting a rich and sprawling adventure that effortlessly oscillates between medieval drama and slice-of-life hijinks in a world that feels distinctly alive"
"It's an impressive feat for such a large and complex game, especially one of such frequent beauty. The rolling hills of Bohemia stretch far beyond the horizon, with castles perched atop basalt rock formations casting long shadows onto fields of wheat and grazing cows. Verdant forests are thick with vegetation; the knee-high grass, flush with vibrant flowers like Marigold and Chamomile, tapers off as dense brush and towering trees take over. Sunlight occasionally peeks through the canopy, casting a luminous glow onto undulating streams of flowing water. Deer and rabbits scarper away, hunted by packs of howling wolves that shatter the hushed atmosphere of these medieval forests. Elsewhere, beyond the high walls of Kuttenberg, there exists a stark contrast to nature's tranquility. Within the hustle and bustle of the city, merchants hawk everything from gambesons to cabbages, with cart tracks perforating the muddy streets and leaving behind manure from the horses dragging them along. The city's denizens laugh over drinks in the city's various taverns, argue with one another outside tailors and armorers, and relax in steamy bathhouses after a day at the steelworks. It genuinely feels like you're peering into a window of the past, complemented by an exhaustive codex that details everything from the clothing and fashion of the time to various folk tales."
"This meticulous eye for detail in the game's visuals, sound design, and adherence to history is just as present in its RPG systems. Combat has been streamlined but is no less complex. It's significantly more fluid and approachable compared to the first game, which makes sense story-wise, as you would expect Henry to have a better grasp of warfare. Combat uses a rosette that allows you to attack from either three or four directions, depending on the weapon type you're using. You can slash from the left, right, and from above, while swords, halberds, and the like are capable of stabbing. Blocking attacks is as simple as holding down a button--provided you have enough stamina--but if you time it correctly, you can execute a perfect block and interrupt your opponent's attack, allowing you to follow up with a riposte."
"These are the basics of combat, but more formidable enemies require more expertise to defeat. Combos are a satisfying way to break through an opponent's tough defense, yet it's the Master strike that's often the most effective. This is an advanced technique you can learn later on, which utilizes the same timing as a perfect block. Rather than simply deflecting an incoming attack, however, Master strikes follow up with an unblockable attack in one seamless motion, exploiting any weaknesses in your opponent's armor. To execute a Master strike, you need to attack in the opposite direction of your opponent, challenging you to read their movements and react accordingly. If they attack from the left, you need to counterattack from the right. If they go for a stab, you need to respond with a strike from above. You also need to be wary of enemy soldiers countering your attacks with a Master strike of their own, creating this delicate dance as you trade ripostes and search for an opening."
"Fighting multiple enemies at once is inherently chaotic by comparison, but emerging victorious is at least doable now. Kingdom Come 2's enemy AI isn't quite as aggressive as it was before, so you can avoid being overrun with clever positioning as you attempt to pick off enemies one by one. It still feels slightly awkward at times, but it helps that the lock-on system is much snappier. You can even flee from combat and live to fight another day, which wasn't a possibility in the first game. The one glaring negative is that successful attacks against unarmored enemies lack the impact you might expect, with little distinction between slicing flesh and colliding with steel-plated armor. Combat is still regularly thrilling, especially when you factor in the various strengths and weaknesses of each weapon type--like maces being capable of breaking through armor--but it isn't peerless."
"Of course, while you can't avoid combat altogether, Kingdom Come 2 offers enough flexibility that you can frequently venture down other avenues of success. Quests are open-ended, giving you multiple ways to reach a conclusion, with even failure functioning as an integral part of the experience, occasionally forcing you to approach situations differently. Sometimes, this comes down to player choice. Other times, it depends on what's available to you. If you're trying to track down a missing person, you might discover their last known location and then attempt to follow a trail of blood or footprints in the mud. However, if you've recovered Henry's faithful canine companion, Mutt, you can give him a whiff of the missing person's clothing and he'll sniff them out."
"Not only are your options varied, but so are the quests themselves. You'll pose as a sommelier to learn a secret wine recipe, compete in a tournament as part of a sword-fighting brotherhood, engage in a petty rivalry between two neighboring villages, investigate a murder and attempt to catch a serial killer, and so much more. These quests are engaging and uniformly well-written and acted, with even minor characters tending to be fairly fleshed out. Kingdom Come 2 is also genuinely funny, frequently injecting a playful irreverence into its historical venture. Side quests often weave into the main story and other side activities, too, rewarding you not just with material gains but with a narrative pay-off and tangible sense of place."
"It's still slow-paced compared to its contemporaries, with some quests revolving around carrying sacks of grain and crafting weapons by gradually hammering heated steel on an anvil, but this is all part of its charm if you're someone who can appreciate placid moments in service of worldbuilding and immersion. The only time this approach infuriated me was in relation to how selling items works. Most merchants lack the money to pay for everything you want to flog, so you have to embark on multiple trips to various shops, moving items back and forth between your horse and your person to avoid over-encumbrance. This is a process you'll typically repeat every few hours, and I wish it weren't the case."
"There has, at least, been a concerted effort to make the game more diverse. The first game was criticized for lacking representation outside of a handful of Turkic Cumans. In Kingdom Come 2, there's a Romani camp early on where you can pick up a few interesting quests pertaining to their beliefs and way of life. Various cultures are represented in Kuttenberg where you'll find plenty of Germans and an authentic Jewish quarter, with plot points delving into what it was like for Jews living in a predominantly Catholic country. Women are more autonomous as well, taking on vital roles that veer outside the lines of the patriarchy. There's still some sleaziness, but this is mainly reserved for those working in bathhouses, and even the women there are given slightly more characterization than the mere sexual objects they previously were."
"It's not perfect, with the codex still needlessly describing the ideal woman of the time as ""a thin, pale woman with long blonde hair, small rounded breasts, relatively narrow hips and a narrow waist."" And while there is a character hailing from Mali, Kuttenberg is also conspicuous for its scarcity of people of color, despite being a major trading city. You would expect a small population of merchants from places like the Middle East and North Africa to exist within its market stalls, so they're notable for their absence."
"While Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 still stumbles in some aspects of its portrayal of 15th-century Bohemia, the shadow that lingered over the first game has mostly dissipated. This is a massively improved sequel in every other area, with better combat, quest design, and none of the technical issues that plagued the original. Not everyone will vibe with its slow-paced and oftentimes tedious approach, but those willing to meet it on its own terms will find a compelling open-world RPG that relishes in player agency and the consequences of your actions."
"Sid Meier's Civilization VII is the newest mainline entry in Firaxis' long-running 4X strategy series, which is built on exploring, expanding, exploiting, and exterminating across procedurally generated maps. Taken on its own, each campaign remains a superbly engaging escapade across eras that will keep you playing for ""one more turn"" until you realize you're late for your sister's birthday party. Civilization VII is not just a game that you play to pass the time during weekends--the experience is compelling enough that it is the weekend, and maybe several weekdays of your life, too."
"For Civilization VII, Firaxis has made some sweeping changes, most notably with how you progress through each historical period. Several of these new features are welcome, given that they address concerns from previous titles while also making campaigns more dynamic. However, a few design decisions are bound to be contentious, especially for longtime fans, since these mechanics tend to impact the player's control over certain outcomes."
"One of the biggest changes in Civilization VII is how you choose leaders and nations separately. Gone are the days when picking Augustus Caesar or Napoleon meant automatically playing as Rome or France, respectively. Instead, leaders have a unique trait that defines their playstyle, and you can select a country independently to complement that playstyle."
"For instance, Hatshepsut's trait--God's Wife of Amun--grants bonuses from imported resources and navigable rivers, while starting close to those same rivers, no less. Naturally, as Pharaoh, you would think that Egypt, which also grants extra production on rivers, would be the best civ choice for Hatshepsut. That might be true, but you could opt to try others, such as the Maya for their science bonuses or Maurya for their additional pantheon belief."
"This concept is brilliant as it offers unparalleled flexibility in how you approach each playthrough. It also gives you the opportunity to strategize right from the get-go: Should you pick leaders and nations that complement one another well, even if it leads to a more rigid path, or should you go against the grain to come up with surprising combinations?"
"Likewise, there's an account-based progression system where you earn Mementos that can be equipped by leaders, giving them beneficial perks such as additional skill points or increased yields. (These can be optionally disabled in multiplayer.) One noteworthy inclusion is the Complaint to Ea-nāṣir--a tablet from ancient Babylon that's considered by the Guinness Book of World Records as the ""oldest written customer complaint""--which provides an Economic attribute point for selected leaders."
"The Memento system is certainly an interesting idea that rewards those who like to ""main"" a particular character. In my case, I played several matches as Jose Rizal, a national hero of the Philippines. Rizal's unique trait grants better rewards from narrative events--new quest chains for each leader, further enriching the roleplaying aspect as you learn more about these historical figures. Since he has a generalist playstyle, I was free to aim for conquest, scientific breakthroughs, or other means of advancement, tackling a plethora of missions and leveling him up as I went along."
"The gameplay in Sid Meier's Civilization VII should feel both fresh and familiar to veterans of the series and other 4X strategy titles. At the start of a match in the Antiquity Age (which replaces the Ancient Era and Classical Era), you found your capital city and send Scouts to explore your surroundings. Scouts even have a new action that reveals nearby ruins that grant advantageous benefits, making the search for ""goodie huts"" as hassle-free as it gets."
"From there, you send out your Settlers to create settlements as you expand across the continent, while also exploiting resource nodes around you. A notable change in Civilization VII compared to its predecessors is that newly founded settlements aren't cities but small towns with specializations, somewhat akin to colony planets in Stellaris. You can, eventually, turn towns into cities, which poses more questions that reinforce the game's strategic depth--do I want this large town to continue specializing in a particular function, or should I turn it into a city so I could be more hands-on with its development?"
"Growing your cities and towns in Civilization VII is now significantly more streamlined. You no longer need to worry about Worker units (they're completely gone). Instead, you just click on a tile and a specific improvement, be it a mine, plantation, farm, or camp, is plopped down instantly for free. You can even pair buildings with one another, creating a quarter (i.e. district) that provides bonuses, as well as build over them with more advanced facilities in later eras--yet another facet that should get yield min-maxers excited."
"These strategic layers further extend to how you take down your opponents through the Commander system, which replaces Great Generals and Great Admirals. Now, Commanders can ""pack"" several units within them--perhaps a nod to the old ""doomstacks"" from earlier Civ games--and enact combined-arms attacks so multiple units can simultaneously strike the same target. Furthermore, units no longer gain skill points, but Commanders do, and their perks affect all those within their radius. Similarly to how you expand settlements, this streamlined process is excellent as it decreases the need to micromanage multiple units by the mid- and late-game stages."
"Meanwhile, the revamped diplomacy system, where influence plays a bigger role, now includes treaties, espionage activities, war support, and actions related to independent peoples/city-states. For instance, if you're lagging behind an opponent, you can incite city-states to raid their lands, while you steal their technologies and cause their war-weariness to spiral out of control. Each of the core 4X gameplay mechanics shine, leading to exhilarating moments where you have to use all available tools to succeed."
"The experience is made even more memorable by gorgeous visuals. The map itself comes to life thanks to breathtaking environments, thematic unit designs, and settlements that showcase your chosen nation's cultural aesthetics. For instance, the buildings in a Shawnee city look vastly different from those in settlements owned by the Mongolians, Ming Chinese, or Songhai. Civilization VII is the type of game that invites you to zoom in and marvel at the details of smaller settlements that have turned into bustling metropolises with distinct architecture and art."
"As mentioned earlier, the biggest, and likely to be the most contentious change in Sid Meier's Civilization VII, is how you progress through each era. In previous games, each campaign is long, drawn-out, and contiguous--you were stuck with the same nation for the rest of your playthrough. Now, the game's eras--Antiquity, Exploration, and Modern--exist as completely separate time periods, each with its own civs, buildings, wonders, crisis events, and progression milestones. Perhaps most surprisingly, you're also required to switch to a different civ upon entering the Exploration Age and the Modern Age."
"The concept of changing from one civ to the next in each era isn't completely new--it's akin to Humankind, a 4X strategy title from Amplitude Studios and Sega. This idea, both on paper and in practice, revitalizes the old Civilization formula, creating a more dynamic approach that encourages you to plan an overarching strategy for the rest of the campaign. Coincidentally, one of Humankind's pitfalls was that cultures lacked distinct properties in spite of a plethora of combinations. This drawback isn't as pronounced in Civilization VII, as each leader still has a unique identity and agenda, even if titles may seem a bit weird--e.g. Benjamin Franklin of the Normans or Himiko, High Shaman of Aksum."
"In one of my campaigns as Xerxes I of Persia, I constructed monuments, altars, and ancient wonders like the Pyramids and Angkor Wat. I also had to contend with a crisis that involved ultra-aggressive independent peoples, akin to the ""Raging Barbarians"" setting from previous games. I then followed Legacy Paths, objectives that nudged me along a steady progression, such as gathering a bunch of codices (Scientific Legacy) and founding several settlements (Military Legacy)."
"Then, when the Antiquity Age gave way to the Exploration Age, I opted to benefit from the Abbasids' science boons. I constructed Machu Picchu and the Forbidden City, while replacing monuments and altars with universities and kilns. Along the way, I had to stem the devastating effects of another crisis, the Black Death, which wiped out many citizens of my empire. As these events happened all around me, I tackled objectives that included sending treasure fleets from distant lands (Economic Legacy) and spreading my Zoroastrian religion to gain relics (Cultural Legacy). All these tasks might sound overwhelming, but they made for unbelievably riveting campaigns, giving a glimpse into how empires rose, fell, adapted, and survived through the course of our shared human history."
"Each feature in Civilization VII, taken on its own, is a treat for veterans like myself who want to see the series' continued evolution. Sadly, these also lead to some of the more egregious problems I've ever seen in a 4X title."
"The first key issue pertains to forced civ-switching in relation to unlock conditions. Unlike in Humankind, where all period-specific cultures are available but it's a race to see which player picks them first, the options in Civilization VII have strict unlock requirements. Case in point: You can only play as the Abbasids if you picked Egypt or Persia beforehand, or if you were able to improve three camel resource nodes. As for Qing China, you can only get them if you chose Ming China earlier or have three tea plantations. Sometimes, you have no control over meeting these requirements or doing so just isn't feasible. After all, you might not have access to the correct resource or the locations aren't that optimal due to procedural generation on maps. That means you're out of luck and you need to decide based on a very limited selection pool. This is a confounding design decision given that leaders, nations, and Legacy Paths offer a lot of flexibility, and yet swapping to another civ, by far the most important choice you make in each campaign, counterintuitively follows rigid rules."
"This is compounded by the fact that there are noticeable gaps and omissions among the currently available countries. A good example is how Rome and Greece are in the game, but Byzantium--the successor empire that combines the cultures of both--is missing, as are Great Britain (which will be part of an upcoming DLC), the Ottomans, the Aztecs, modern-day India, and any Scandinavian nation, for that matter. I was also perplexed when I saw that Jose Rizal of the Philippines unlocked Hawaii, of all countries, as there is no available option among Southeast Asian nations that had anti-colonial struggles. Vietnam isn't a civ but is represented by Trung Trac (leader), while Indonesia is represented by Majapahit (Exploration Age). Siam/Thailand is the only Modern Age Southeast Asian civ, though the country was never colonized by a European power."
"Another factor to consider is that each era transition is basically a soft reset for all players. Once the progress meter hits 100% due to turn advancements or Legacy milestones, all construction projects, wonders, and related missions end abruptly--for everyone. One moment, you might be actively participating and enjoying tasks like sending out treasure fleets or spreading your religion far and wide, and the next, those mechanics are gone for good. Even all your units, regardless of where they might be, are removed from the map, only for period-specific variants to spawn randomly across your empire at the start of the next age. The concept itself would be the equivalent of Mehmed the Conqueror arriving at the gates of Constantinople, only to get magically teleported to Edirne because the Aztecs discovered the last holy relic that they needed."
"This may have been implemented to curb the ""snowballing"" effect so everyone can be on a somewhat level playing field again. Still, this feels like being punished for doing too well, and is likely to impact aggressive and competitive players significantly."
"Sadly, Civilization VII also feels incomplete. The Modern Age simply encompasses the industrial period up to Yuri Gagarin's space flight in the 1960s. The most advanced military units are tanks and fighter planes, and there's no Information/Contemporary Age whatsoever. Granted, Civilization campaigns tend to turn into unbearable slogs upon reaching later stages that many players don't even finish their games. Still, removing a historical period in its entirety doesn't feel like the best solution."
"Furthermore, I've noticed a few issues with the user interface that confounded me initially. These include panels that don't explain how merchants are utilized, as well as the usage of civ-specific Great People on hexes--in a few instances, I had to mouse over several tiles in my cities since the correct spots weren't highlighted at all. Speaking of buildings, I've also seen how civ-specific facilities can't be constructed on certain tiles and, without the option to remove what I've built beforehand, I was unable to complete certain quarters."
"Sid Meier's Civilization VII's ""one more turn"" aspect is still as engaging as ever, and I enjoyed huge portions of my playthroughs. Several facets, such as those related to diplomacy, espionage, crises, and combat address long-standing concerns. Legacy Paths and narrative events, meanwhile, offer rich and rewarding avenues for advancement through the ages. Unfortunately, as someone who's seen the heights that previous series entries have reached, the vanilla Civilization VII experience still needs a few tweaks, as it's held back by the aforementioned issues that occur during brief but crucial era transitions. Granted, the changes this series has undergone over the years--whether it's the square tiles or hexes debate, the ""one unit per tile"" drama, or city-planning with districts--have been for the better, eventually. The issues deemed controversial or cumbersome at the start paved the way for a better overall experience. As such, even if Civilization VII has a strong foundation, we might not see the game's full potential until much later in its lifespan. But, hey: At least the franchise has been consistent in that regard."
"Eternal Strands weaves together a deeply intriguing scene from its earliest moments, stitching together a picture of a fantasy world built around the concept of magic emulating threads. It's a world I wanted to dive into from the jump, if only to uncover more of how it came to be and what the cultures of the different locations are like. And as much as the worldbuilding retains that wonder with incredible-looking environments that make for engaging play spaces for the physics-based magic system, the beat-for-beat details of Eternal Strands' story aren't nearly as rewarding to unravel."
"Eternal Strands' story too often hits on familiar fantasy tropes, such as an inexplicable magical disaster that changed everything and a corrupting force that seemingly has no weakness and must be avoided at all costs. But the history that story is built on adds a semblance of life to the world, building memorable NPCs that you want to come back to again and again to talk about what in their life led them to where they are now, and painting a somber undertone to the world that begs to be uncovered through its detailed lore notes and optional collectibles."
"I especially love how Eternal Strands packages aspects of its history so they're viewed through the art of weaving--not a typical choice for action-adventure games. Concepts like spells are recontextualized, transforming from arcane runes into fashion choices. You can largely avoid the historical exposition if you'd rather spend your time swinging a sword and spewing fire, but there's some great writing to uncover here for lore hounds."
"The moment-to-moment of the present-day narrative is less compelling, however, standing out in stark contrast to the far more interesting historical events that led up to it. The main characters are memorable enough, and conversations with them are brought to life with great voice acting--Rebecca Hanssen as Casmyn is a notable highlight, giving a guarded edge to the soft words of the horned quartermaster that makes you want to get to know her more (and her romance arc is so sweet!)."
"You approach this cast as Brynn, the recently anointed scout who ventures out into the wilds beyond the safety of her party's camp to find resources, search dangerous locations, handle threats, and uncover the origin of a puzzling calamity. Her personality is shaped based on the options you choose during dialogue with other characters, allowing you to somewhat curate Brynn's always-positive disposition and plucky attitude to be more assertive, jovial, or stoic, and these choices are reflected in how the other characters regard her, with the most substantial effect being the option to romance some of them."
"The most interesting aspect of Eternal Strands is its magic system. Brynn can command the forces of gravity, ice, and fire, and both the world and enemies within it react to how you use these powers. At their simplest, they allow Brynn to throw, freeze, and ignite enemies, but they can also be used more strategically to both fight and explore in new ways. Brynn's gravity powers can be used to propel herself skyward, for example, or pick up a dropped sword to violently skewer an enemy, or she can use ice to freeze the air and create a temporary bridge to cross a gap or stitch an invisible enemy to the ground to make them easier to hit. In the same respect, Brynn's magic can affect the world as you imagine it would--fire magic can melt parts of the world covered in frost, ice magic can freeze water, and gravity magic can stack pretty much anything that isn't nailed down."
"This magic system is at its best when Brynn contends with the colossal threats that patrol each environment, ranging from fire-breathing dragons to lumbering constructs. These powerful, boss-like enemies must be strategically handled, often having weak points that you need to clamber up the monsters' bodies to reach. I only defeated a fire-breathing drake after I managed to climb up its leg onto its back and started swinging Brynn's sword at the one place its flaming breath could not reach, using ice magic to freeze its wings in place when it decided to take off so that I could send it back to earth. And I managed to defeat one of the armored constructs by freezing its foot to the ground, using gravity magic to rip away the plate armor around its torso, and then using Brynn's gravity magic on herself to fling her upwards to instantly get to the revealed weak point."
"Optional pieces of lore on these titanic monsters can be uncovered while exploring the world, but even if you do put in the legwork to better understand how these monsters might behave or be more easily defeated ahead of time, there's still a need to react to their behavior and come up with new plans on the fly to take them down. There's a fulfilling sense of victory to taking these behemoths down, and intuiting a new plant of attack in the moment and seeing my labors result in success was a consistent source of delight. These often long hunts are worth the effort too, as each successful kill results in a small explosion of colorful high-level materials that you can use to craft better gear and weapons, as well as the necessary components to weave new spells or upgrade your existing abilities."
"Fights against the normal wildlife or human-sized constructs aren't nearly as rewarding. Beyond her magic, Brynn also has a sword, shield, and bow, and she can unlock a two-handed greatsword--these tools can take care of the smaller threats easily with a little button mashing. About three hours into Eternal Strands, I killed a dragon, used the harvested materials to craft a bow that could deal fire damage, and pretty much managed to avoid combat against normal enemies after that by burning everything alive from a distance. It made traversing through most of each environment trivial, as I could snipe most enemies before Brynn got close enough for anything to register her presence. Only the larger-than-life monsters continued to pose any sort of challenge necessitating me to think about survival and how to fight."
"Each locale that Brynn visits is beautifully realized, from stoic and empty cities to vibrant and noisy jungles. A few of the environments afford Brynn the chance to use her magic--specifically gravity and ice--to navigate them vertically, leaping between rooftops or towers and going off the beaten path to discover a secret or two. Rarely, however, are these places difficult to navigate, even when the random weather system introduces a danger like toxic miasma. They're built in a largely linear fashion, funneling Brynn from one side to the other to reach her next objective, and although there are times when the scout has multiple missions active at once, it never feels like you're actually getting a chance to explore these spaces. For a game that fashions its protagonist as a much-needed scout paving the way forward, Brynn spends an awful lot of Eternal Strands following the directives of others and being told where she can go as soon as she unlocks a new area to explore. For as much as Eternal Strands frees you to practice your agency in taking down the colossal monsters that dot its dangerous world, it limits you in almost every regard."
"Eternal Strands is a straightforward action-adventure game. The physics-based magic system adds a lot of fun and satisfyingly strategic energy to Brynn's regular run-ins with colossal enemies, but smaller threats rarely rise above being a tedious hindrance. And although the history of the world is interesting to uncover and conversations with Brynn's party members a regularly lively delight, the actual moment-to-moment story beats don't feel all that compelling. It's a shame that Eternal Strands' lows drag parts of its experience down, because the narrative and gameplay have clear highs that would excel in a game that wasn't holding them back."
"Not every game needs to be more like IO Interactive's Hitman, but some games would benefit from adopting more of that incredible series' strong points. This is something Rebellion seemed to figure out around the time of Sniper Elite 3 back in 2014, when the series ditched linear levels set in tight, wartorn streets in favor of a much deeper, wider tour of duty, with each map allowing for player choice in how they navigate the world and complete missions. The series has even gone so far as to create some absurd, Agent 47-like situations in which you can assassinate Nazis. Sniper Elite: Resistance reintroduces that tried-and-true formula for the fourth time in 11 years, and though it's still enjoyable, I can't help but notice how this campaign through the French countryside elicits such a strong sense of deja vu."
"Sniper Elite is a third-person shooter set during World War II, and like other games in the series, it can be played in first-person when you're aiming. The series has made a name for itself on a deep ballistic physics model that accounts for wind, bullet drop, and positioning, as well as its cherry on top: the X-ray killcam. This feature shows you, in slow-motion, how each bullet shreds Nazis in grotesque detail, inside and out. Like in other Sniper Elite games, a well-placed bullet can shoot their eyes out, explode their hearts, or even obliterate their testicles, among other special displays of sharpshooting."
"Like its predecessors, the game is a fun and reliable shooter when it comes to sniping mechanics, though I've grown weary of the killcam. These days, I more often skip the killcam, or at least adjust my settings to see fewer headhunting highlight reels. I get it by now; it's neat tech, but they add up over the course of a mission, which already tend to take me about two hours each, because I'm much more interested in stealthily completing my missions than watching the highlight reels of long-range vivisections."
"Sniper Elite: Resistance shifts the focus from the usual series protagonist, Karl Fairburne, to a character formerly designated as Player 2 in the game's co-op campaign, Harry Hawker. A British soldier, Hawker's missions task him with performing the same type of feats for which Fairburne has long earned medals: infiltrating crowded Nazi strongholds, blowing up a few subs, trucks, or missile command centers, and displacing the brain matter of every fascist he encounters along the way."
"With fascism newly fashionable again in some parts of the world, it would seem cathartic to simulate such vivid Nazi destruction, and yet, Sniper Elite has never cared to paint its villains as more than The Bad Guys, the way some games may with zombies or aliens. They feel comic-booky, and ultimately that's okay--albeit unmoving--as the story has never been much of the point in these games anyway."
"Each mission opens with a main objective, but you'll find optional objectives as you explore, a high-value target who can often be killed creatively--like planting a rat-shaped bomb in the kitchen for him to shoot and detonate--and other helpful secrets, like weapon workbenches and alternate starting locations for revisited missions. No Sniper Elite protagonist is all that durable, so while you could maybe sprint across each sprawling map and wipe out your to-do list in under 20 minutes if you really wanted to, I can't imagine it would be much fun or easy--in the open, the heroes die quickly. Instead, a methodical, stealthy approach is clearly how the game hopes you'll play it, though it tries to give you the tools to go loud when you need to, as well."
"That's a place Resistance struggles, however, and it's a familiar struggle. Outside of sniping, gunplay isn't great. Aiming around cover is often janky, with Hawker unreliably sticking to a wall. Aiming in first-person with guns like SMGs and pistols also feels slow and unwieldy, though the reticle in third-person is pretty punishing, too, rarely narrowing in a way that promises your shots will be on target. Even the act of hurdling some waist-high objects, like railings or fences, proves to be consistent only in how inconsistent it is. Some walls I could scale easily, while others that would seem to be of a similar or identical height didn't prompt me to leap over them. These aspects wind up leaving me untrusting of the world at times. If all hell breaks loose, I'd like to be able to trust a nearby cover object, but in Resistance, like in all of these games, that's not always the case."
"In part, Rebellion has put itself in a tricky spot. Clearly, the team is smaller and dealing with fewer resources than many games in the shooter space, and yet each installment looks pretty good and plays well enough that it can be easy to view the team as competing in the AAA space even though it truly isn't. Traditionally, I've forgiven some of the jank and lack of polish for this reason. Rebellion is a team already overachieving by some measure, but to release so many sequels that feel so similar to each other at this point, it starts to feel more like an issue we see in the sports gaming world. A lack of game-to-game innovation jumps off the screen."
"This is most egregiously depicted in Resistance's skill tree, which is identical to Sniper Elite 5's (SE5) skill tree. It's not just galling to run back the same skills as before for players to unlock; it suffers doubly because that skill tree wasn't so exciting to begin with. Many of its skills I have no use for, like being able to maintain my heart rate better during sprinting, and the tree also lacks some abilities I find obviously needed, such as allowing for a faster crouch-walking speed. Anyone who has played a few of these games and has an introductory grasp on in-game progression systems would likely have a few neat ideas that could've populated Resistance's skill tree. Perhaps they would've even tried and failed to one-up SE5's skill tree, which would've been disappointing, but worse is to re-use the one that was already there."
"Some similar design decisions show up elsewhere, too, such as Missions 1 and 4 of the campaign being set on the same map, though Mission 4 does at least give you more space to explore that map. Later in the campaign, a mission re-uses many of the same assets and the basic setting as an early mission in SE5, to the extent that I had to look up whether it was set on the same exact map. (It isn't.) It's said the story is set in France because Hawker's saga runs concurrently with Fairburne's SE5 adventure elsewhere in the nation, but with choices like these on display, it starts to feel like Resistance, right down to how its name drops the use of numerics, is a sizable standalone expansion tied to SE5 rather than a sequel."
"To the team's credit, and partly what's creating its image of a much more resource-heavy studio, there's a lot to do outside the solo campaign. Like most of these games, Resistance's campaign can be played entirely in two-player co-op, including cross-play lobbies. Not everything is better in co-op, but many games are, and this is one of them, provided you find a teammate with the same playstyle as you. The game also offers an Invasion mode akin to Deathloop or Dark Souls, in which you can jump into another player's live campaign and hunt them down as an adversary."
"This is the game's most thrilling mode of all, as the consequences of each decision by either player become much more magnified. Making noise, alerting enemies, or missing shots will bring a pained grimace to your face when you're trying to eliminate or outlast your adversary. Frankly, this series has not received enough credit for how cool this mode is. The huge maps, with their many different viable routes and strategies to employ, make this feel like the game's secret weapon. Even as the campaign feels too familiar at times, Invasion mode invigorates it with greater appeal. Like always, if you hate the idea of being invaded, you can also just turn this feature off, or leave it open only to friends."
"Sniper Elite also includes team-based PvP modes and wave-based PvE modes. I'd actually just begun playing these in SE5 last month, so though I'm not a long-time player, I have come to find, including in Resistance, that there's actually a bit more magic here, too. The best of the modes is No Cross, which splits each map asymmetrically down the middle, inviting players into a snipers-versus-snipers headshot tournament where no one can traverse the gap to the other side."
"Like Invasion, this mode is tense and exciting. Each sightline has counters, and the glint of your scope is a betrayer that promises no one camps for long before losing their helmet and all of its squishy contents. It reminds me of an era a few generations ago when shooters were trying to find their niche beyond simply doing what Call of Duty was doing. Not all of those attempts were successes, and Resistance's PvP/PvE modes don't seem likely to topple the genre's titans anytime soon, but for players who appreciate the game's physics and combat, you can spend many hours in Resistance's peripheral modes and get more enjoyment out of it than you might in the solo story mode, where returns are noticeably diminishing if you've frequented this series to date."
"All of these side attractions to the single-player campaign end up being stronger reasons to experience Sniper Elite: Resistance. Oddly, the one thing the game adds to its suite of modes is Propaganda missions, which I found to be quite forgettable. Unlocked by finding propaganda posters in the campaign, these seven bonus missions return you to maps from the story with new stealth, sniping, or open-combat challenges to perform in a timed environment. These feel totally skippable unless you and some buddies are into bragging rights and want to compete for the top scores. Whereas Invasion mode is an under-heralded destination mode for this series, I would be unsurprised and even content if Propaganda missions are one-and-done."
"I experienced some bugs in my time with the game, such as invisible walls that shouldn't have been there and some jank at the top of staircases that would catch me or NPCs if we were crouch-walking. A patch deployed before the game's launch seems to have cleared up most of these issues, so though they got in my way at times, they shouldn't get in yours much or at all. This patch didn't address my issues with inconsistent wall grabs and hurdles, but then neither did the last three games, so that speaks more to my hope for the series' future, not just my feelings on Resistance itself."
"In the end, Sniper Elite: Resistance is a fun game that you'll probably enjoy if you liked the last few, but you'll likely enjoy it even more if you're new to the series. Some of its signature moves, like the gruesome killcam and the solid sniping mechanics, are getting a bit stale here as the series has mostly stopped innovating across consecutive sequels."
"While the campaign is fun but often too familiar, Resistance shines most of all in some of the game's secondary modes, particularly Invasion and No Cross PvP. Of course, bringing a buddy along to play the story in co-op smooths over some of its roughness, too. I do want to play more of this series, but I'm hopeful the next one takes a bigger leap forward and cleans up some of the long-present jank. Like the difference between the second and third games in the series, it's only going to be the next big step for Sniper Elite if the team finally innovates on what existed before. Otherwise, it's just sparkling familiarity."
"Marvel Rivals has come for the hero-shooter crown, and it's hard to argue that it doesn't have a legitimate claim to the throne. It has a big roster of heroes with a ton of variety across them, no role queue, and 6v6, all of which are important to a great hero shooter. Although it lifts more than a few of Overwatch's ideas, it is actively targeting and addressing some of the biggest complaints players have about Blizzard's shooter. Marvel Rivals expands on familiar ideas in smart ways and has a visually striking and distinct art style. Add in that it's a fun multiplayer experience and it makes it far more than just another also-ran hero shooter clone."
"Opting for 6v6 and a third-person camera view, Marvel Rivals has a vast variety of playstyles across its launch roster. Offering everything from simple shooting-focused heroes like Punisher to complex melee heroes like Spider-Man, all the while making it feel cohesive. Although it will undoubtedly be chaotic for players trying a hero shooter like this for the first time, there are a variety of heroes that make picking up the game simple and an impressive roster of alternative picks that can gradually increase complexity."
"It does have limited main game modes at launch, with only Domination, which involves fighting over a control point; Convoy, where a team escorts a payload; and Convergence, which is a combination of the two. These are split across a variety of maps taken from the Marvel multiverse, with locations like Tokyo 2099, Yggsgard, and the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda. These different locations provide a ton of environmental variety, with the pristine look of Asgard contrasted with the dense buildings of Tokyo 2099. While the visual styles don't change the flow of the game, the map layouts do. For example, both Tokyo 2099 and Klyntar have hybrid maps--where the attacking team must capture a control point, which unlocks a payload to push--but Tokyo 2099 has multiple buildings blocking the defenders' line of sight, while on Klyntar the area from spawn to the point is much more open, promoting more long-range hero options. It can become visually stale, but more importantly, having fewer modes means that your team's strategies don't shift as much from match to match, which can result in them blending together because each individual match doesn't feel unique, aside from the team compositions."
"What helps keep things fresh is the massive roster of 33 characters, which can be combined in numerous ways thanks to a lack of role queue. A role queue would lock players into one of the three classes (Duelist, Vanguard, and Strategist), forcing a perfect 2-2-2 composition. Across numerous quick play and competitive matches, however, there is usually a ton of variety in the team compositions, many of which can be viable: Dropping a Vanguard to have a third Duelist can be as effective as running three Strategists with only one Duelist. Teaming up Magik, Spider-Man, and Black Panther to overwhelm the enemy with close-range characters is a strategy that not only promotes but rewards aggressiveness, giving a much different match feel than just sitting back with two tanks, and wouldn't be possible with forced roles. Sure, it leads to the occasional match where your team runs all Duelists and gets rolled because of it, but the strategy it offers in exchange is worth the trade off."
"Many of these heroes do feel like they were pulled straight out of Overwatch, even if they are mash-ups, like Starlord taking abilities from Reaper and Tracer. Hawkeye's and Black Widow's abilities share a resemblance to Hanzo and Widowmaker from Overwatch. Luna Snow has a similar ultimate to Zenyatta, while Mantis can heal and buff enemies in a similar fashion to how Zenyatta heals by placing orbs that heal over time. But other characters, particularly the melee-focused ones, are more original. Magik, Iron Fist, and Spider-Man, for example, feel like new creations for Marvel Rivals. The same goes for many of the Vanguard heroes like Groot, who can build a variety of walls to defend his teammates and block entrances. These walls aren't time-limited like Mei's from Overwatch, but instead will stay up until destroyed or if Groot chooses to move them. Destroying the walls gives away your position to the enemy group, creating a more dynamic power than just a temporary wall. There are enough new ideas to keep Marvel Rivals from entering ripoff territory, but there is certainly a sense of deja vu at times."
"The dedication to bringing comic superpowers to Marvel Rivals while still creating a unique shooter has also led to some interesting characters. While there is no shortage of straightforward shooting heroes, like Hela, Hawkeye, and Punisher, the abundance of melee-only characters adds a more MOBA-like feel to matches. Ability combos for characters like Spider-Man can be challenging to master, as you're required to land four different abilities in a short period of time to be effective. There's enough depth to many heroes to be a challenge for skilled players, and mastering the usage of abilities is satisfying. The game balance favors the more aggressive characters at the moment, but the number of heroes who feel unplayable in competitive modes is incredibly low, which is surprising for a game with such a large roster. That high number of viable characters helps to keep each match varied. The biggest complaint here is that there are a few too many Strategist ultimates that do so much healing that anything other than an ultimate from the other team is completely ineffective; there are definitely some damage sponges that can be in play at times."
Marvel Rivals expands on familiar ideas in smart ways and has a visually striking and distinct art style ... add in that it's a fun multiplayer experience and it makes it far more than just another also-ran hero shooter clone
"Another aspect of team building are the team-ups, which grant extra abilities if certain characters are on the same team. Some are simple, like Adam Warlock granting certain Guardians of the Galaxy his passive ability to resurrect after dying, but some grant more interesting abilities. Psylocke and Black Panther can use Magik's portals, letting them rewind a few seconds to a previous location, granting bonus health, which function like temporary shields. This adds another layer to their abilities and provides a simple way to identify good team compositions without needing to spend hours testing which heroes pair well together on a more granular level. The majority of these team-ups provide small bonuses, so you aren't forced to play around them either."
"The third-person gameplay feels precise and responsive, with abilities and projectiles behaving exactly how you want them to and being satisfying because of this. Abilities feel like they are constantly available to use, without resulting in full on ability spam, letting you feel like you are doing something engaging beyond just shooting at your opponents. Maps offer multiple paths to flank or get the high ground as well, letting you try a new approach each fight. At the same time, the maps don't offer so many paths that it becomes too much to manage. Some heroes like Black Panther and Spider-Man zip around the battlefield, and it can feel like you're fighting the camera a bit to keep track of them, but this issue does dissipate as you learn more about the flow of the game. Once you understand exactly what these characters can do and how far their movement takes them, it becomes easier to deal with their mobility. The gameplay is fast-paced and chaotic, but it does have strong readability thanks to the audio and visual designs."
"Marvel Rivals' art style is striking, with paint-like strokes on the characters combined with a slight cel-shading to create a distinct look that evokes comic books without being gimmicky. Not only does it make the game look great, but this kind of art style is necessary for Marvel Rivals to be playable. With 12 players frequently fighting each other, the screen can get busy, potentially making it difficult to identify and react to abilities, but the aesthetic maintains a level of clarity that is necessary. It also avoids the pitfalls of feeling like it's a knockoff of the MCU, channeling a variety of comic looks and lore, while adding its own twists to designs to make it feel unique."
"With the distinct look and animations for each character, you can quickly identify who you are looking at and what abilities they are using. Even with characters that have similar physical builds like Luna Snow, Dagger, and Mantis, each has distinct enough coloring and animations to make them easily identifiable at a glance. The recognizability of animations and silhouettes are just as important because of skins--which can alter how characters look slightly--especially as more elaborate and colorful skins are added in the future."
"The audio design is a bit messier, although it does lean more on functionality than artistry. Characters are regularly shouting, calling out enemies or specific abilities, like Moon Knight placing an Ankh to ricochet attacks off of. These callouts make Marvel Rivals more manageable to play, especially with how powerful ultimate attacks are, but can become overwhelmingly noisy. Each character has a very loud shout for their ultimate, which is different depending on if they are friend or foe, allowing you to quickly react when these happen. It can be obnoxious sometimes, like Winter Soldier repeatedly shouting again on each ultimate retrigger, which can happen within seconds of each other, but it is important for managing the battlefield. Beyond shouting, many of the weapons and abilities have distinct sounds, reducing the amount of time you need to identify and react to an attack, which makes for a more competitive shooter."
"With only two key differences, Marvel Rivals' competitive mode doesn't feel too different from quick play. First, payload maps have both teams play offense and defense, which is necessary for a fair match. Second, matches at Diamond rank and above allow for two to four heroes to be banned. While this is nice to limit some of the more powerful heroes, bans do narrow some of the strategy that makes Marvel Rivals so engaging. If you were locked into your pick for the whole match it might make more sense, but since you can swap at any time, it removes some necessary counter-picks that allow you to shift the momentum of a match. Instead of placements, you start at Bronze and have to work your way up, which does result in some bizarre matches in the lower ranks since players of all skill levels might be there depending on how much they have played."
"Marvel Rivals is free-to-play, meaning there are microtransactions, but its monetization is fairly standard in terms of pricing. All heroes are free, including future ones, and the only things to buy are cosmetics. Battle passes don't expire, and while Marvel Rivals isn't the first game to offer this, it is an uncommon but welcome practice. Knowing you won't miss out on cosmetics in a battle pass you already paid for just because you don't have time to play is a great quality-of-life feature. Cosmetics are pricey but not out of line with what's seen in many other games, with legendaries coming in around $23 and epics coming in around $18. One upside is that, at least so far, Marvel Rivals is fairly selective with which skins are deemed legendary, with some surprisingly cool skins getting priced at the epic tier. The battle pass costs $10 and includes 10 skins and some premium currency, in addition to smaller cosmetics like sprays, MVP intros, and name plates making it a pretty great offer overall."
"Overall, Marvel Rivals feels like the first hero shooter since Overwatch launched in 2015 to fully capture the magic of the genre. It offers a ton of heroes to play with, a great visual style, and a focus on making the game fun for everyone. While it does lift directly from Overwatch, its more original ideas make it feel fresh in the space. Marvel Rivals is a great multiplayer shooter in its early days, and if it can deliver on future updates, it could remain one for years to come."
"Donkey Kong has always been the more brutal, off-putting relative to the affable, approachable Mario brothers. Both Donkey Kong Country and the Super Marios are classic side-scrolling platformers at their core, but DKC has been known less for joyful leaping and more for clenching your jaw. Now as the Nintendo Switch approaches its eighth year and Nintendo is increasingly reaching into its back catalog for ports, DKC Returns is back with a package that combines all the features of the Wii and 3DS versions--including some assists and visual enhancements--but still feels tough-as-nails in a way that could push away more casual platformer fans."
"DKC Returns HD does retain the tweaks made to the 2013 3DS port, including a Modern mode (originally called New mode in the 3DS version) with additional items in Cranky's shop and an extra pip of health. The items in Cranky's shop are especially tuned to let you selectively tweak the difficulty, since the banana coins currency are so plentiful that you'll almost always have enough to spare on an item or two. Those items range from help finding collectible puzzle pieces to temporary invincibility. You can always opt for the original mode to play with the original Wii difficulty, if that's more your flavor. And it does look nicely polished on Switch, especially on the OLED screen. That said, the character models look relatively simplistic compared to Tropical Freeze, a 2014 Wii U game that was already ported to Switch in 2018."
"The Modern mode is meant to sand off the edges of the notoriously punishing game and make it more approachable, but make no mistake: This is still a brutally difficult game. Even with three hearts instead of the original two, it's very easy to lose multiple lives (or near the end, tens of lives) in a single stage as you learn its rhythms and assorted traps. And the difficulty in DKC Returns is true to its roots, which centers heavily on memorization. The game frequently introduces threats too quickly to react to the first time, and DK himself feels stiff and heavy compared to the acrobatic Mario. Trickier stages will even give the appearance of one type of obstacle and then frustratingly punish you for reacting to the fake-out."
"The level design is where DKC Returns stands out the most, with a wide variety of biomes that introduce unique mechanics and visual flourishes that may only be used once or twice. One stage might have you riding the rails while the next could put you in silhouette with only DK's bright red tie as a splash of color. One of my favorites is set against a massive storm creating continuous tsunamis, making each moment a mad dash to the next wall that will protect you. And the stages make excellent use of the space to hide secrets, usually tied to pulling off an extra-stylish move. You can simply jump on an enemy, for example, but if you hit A at the perfect time, you'll get a boost and jump higher into a hidden platform that leads to a bonus area. Those nooks and crannies create lots of replay value if you want to uncover everything DKC Returns has to offer."
"If you die multiple times in a stage, a helpful pig will appear to offer you the Super Guide, but I'm not sure I understand the point of it. As the prompt notes, it doesn't actually count towards completion, so you can't just tag in the AI assistant to finish a level for you. It also pointedly doesn't even attempt to grab collectibles, even when they're generally on the path it's already using. That means it doesn't show you the locations of secrets, so you can't use it to scope out an optimal path to grab all the optional K-O-N-G letters or puzzle pieces. It essentially just shows you how to get through a stage, and even though it gives you a pretty good rundown, simply being shown the layout still leaves you to execute with perfect precision."
"Like any platformer, the difficulty has peaks and valleys, and some stages you can nail on the first run. It's a very satisfying feeling, especially when you suddenly find yourself catching your breath upon reaching the end goal. Difficulty spikes can sneak up on you, though, and it's sometimes hard to tell if a stage will be unusually difficult until after you've spent several lives reaching a checkpoint. At that point, it's a tough choice between quitting to buy some helpful items from Cranky's shop or brute-forcing your way through the rest of the stage."
"Even if you do make a pit stop at his shop, Cranky's items take some trial and error to learn their intricacies. For example, despite the name, the invincibility item doesn't actually make you invincible--you're still susceptible to spikes, crashes, and falls. The invincibility item effectively just adds five more pips to your health and gives DK a golden sheen, and once those are spent you go back to your regular lifebar. Graciously, this effect lasts through multiple lives, so if you lose one pip during a stage you'll start again with four. But the game doesn't explain that. If you want to be truly invincible, you'll need to own several items, stacking them to have multiple effects at once. Any that you don't use get returned to you so you're not wasting resources experimenting, alleviating some of the irritation of figuring out which items you need to stack to get the effect you want."
"While most of the mechanics feels appropriately in-line with modern platformers, one unwelcome holdover from other DKC games confusingly continues to persist. One button is mapped to both the roll and a ground-pound, as was the case in Tropical Freeze, with the only difference being whether you're moving in a direction when you press it. Functionally, that means you need to make sure you're standing absolutely still to ground pound, or you'll just roll off in a direction instead. I died several times trying to ground-pound a button and instead rolling right off a ledge, and at least once trying to roll out of the way of an obstacle and ground-pounding instead."
"But DK's weighty controls help to accentuate one of the game's best power-ups, Diddy Kong. Picking up a Diddy barrel effectively doubles your health bar and gives you the power to glide with Diddy's rocket pack, and he leaves when you lose his share of hearts. It's enough to dramatically alter the dynamic of the game, which makes it that much more punishing when you lose him. This is especially noticeable in some boss fights, including the final boss, when you can enter the battle with Diddy, lose him on the first life, and then have to go without Diddy for every subsequent attempt. It creates a certain snowball effect--if you were already struggling with the relatively maneuverable Diddy in tow, it only gets harder when he's gone."
"The classic DK-and-Diddy buddy dynamic is the clearest example of referencing the original Donkey Kong Country, especially since this one doesn't include fellow companion characters Dixie or Kiddy Kong. Rambi the rhino makes an appearance in some stages, but the game graciously forgoes underwater stages and so there isn't any room for Engarde the swordfish. And the villains of the game, a band of evil living totems, is a far cry from the iconic status of the stoutly crocodile King K. Rool."
"All that is to say, Donkey Kong Country Returns is a throwback through and through. It's a little less novel than it was when it first appeared on Wii and was the first DKC game in more than a decade, and at this point a lot of its refinements and clever level ideas have been surpassed by the later Tropical Freeze. It's the best way to play DKC Returns and to revisit some truly top-class level design, though. The visual overhaul looks nice on modern displays and it encompasses the improvements made to the 3DS port. Just be warned: Given the sharp and sometimes frustrating difficulty spikes, only the most dedicated ape enthusiasts need apply."
"When it comes down to it, the essence of Dynasty Warriors' longevity is simple: Cleaving through hundreds of enemies like a hot knife through butter feels really good. It's the ultimate power fantasy, with each swing of your weapon sending bodies careening through the air in every conceivable direction as the KO counter ticks up into the thousands. For almost 25 years, this basic formula has remained virtually unchanged, lending the series a fervent albeit niche following. Dynasty Warriors 9 attempted to evolve the formula, but the shift to a lifeless open world was a misstep that didn't mesh with the series' core appeal. Dynasty Warriors: Origins, as the name implies, sees Omega Force returning to its roots, emphasizing the large-scale, hack-and-slash action Dynasty Warriors is known for while implementing a number of clever new additions that achieve what Dynasty Warriors 9 failed to."
"If you're unfamiliar with the long-running series, Dynasty Warriors is based on Luo Guanzhong's 14th-century novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms--and the ancient history it's based on--loosely adapting the classic Chinese novel by taking some absurd creative liberties along the way. While previous games in the series have typically covered the bulk of the Three Kingdoms period from 184 AD to 280 AD, Origins tightly focuses on the early parts of the story, beginning with the rise of the Yellow Turban Rebellion and culminating in the decisive Battle of Chibi. Unlike the rest of the series, the story is also told from the perspective of an amnesiac warrior who's meeting legendary figures like Guan Yu, Dong Zhuo, and the fearsome Lü Bu for the first time. This setup is clearly designed with newcomers in mind, making the series' enduring legacy and myriad beloved characters much more palatable for new players to dive into for the first time."
"Still, that doesn't mean returning players will be left wanting. By focusing on the early events of the Three Kingdoms' tapestry, Omega Force has opted to delve into the time period in greater detail than before, with a renewed emphasis on storytelling and character development. Even minor figures are more fleshed out, while pivotal moments are given the gravitas they deserve. This is somewhat of a double-edged sword, however. The writing is generally solid, with defined, charming, and likable characters engaging in moral quandaries and battles of both wit and brawn, but the overabundance of cutscenes sometimes works to its detriment. Too many conversations simply feel derivative, either repeating plot points or adding little of substance to the narrative and your understanding of its ensemble cast of characters. This disrupts the game's pacing, leading to more than a few occasions where you're forced to wait impatiently for the next battle to arrive as you cycle through one superfluous conversation after another."
"Origins' secondary story--which revolves around its amnesiac hero slowly regaining his memories--is also much weaker than the Three Kingdoms plotline, dealing in bland cliches and predictable twists. It's disappointing, but this pivot to a lone protagonist has a significantly greater impact on Origins' hack-and-slash action than its narrative quality. Dynasty Warriors is known for featuring a massive roster of playable characters, with the previous game in the series totaling a whopping 94. By comparison, Origins features a single character and just nine playable companions, each of whom functions as a powerful support hero you can temporarily take control of before switching back to the amnesiac hero. It's a risky shift for the series that may feel like a dramatic step back for veteran fans, but it's a change that becomes easier to accept once you're in the thick of the action."
"Out on the battlefield, Origins feels like an authentic Dynasty Warriors experience, just on a much grander scale than ever before. Thousands of characters regularly fill the screen, with flaming arrows raining down from the sky and generals engaging in flashy duels amidst the chaos unfolding all around them. It's a pure spectacle of histrionic warfare, with you in the middle, slicing through hundreds of peons as though they were blades of grass. In true Dynasty Warriors fashion, it's methodical and repetitive in a way that will appeal to a specific type of player, achieving a strange sort of zen as entire armies crumble before you."
"The moment-to-moment action and mission design still lack some variety, especially now that the roster has been decimated, but that's always been part of the appeal. That's not to say it isn't still disappointing, since the missions that break away from the formula are its most interesting. But combat is so tightly designed, from the responsiveness of the controls to the satisfaction that follows each swing and overhead slash of your weapon, that your 100,000th kill is still just as fulfilling as your 1,000th was. It's not for everyone, and history proves how divisive the Dynasty Warriors formula is, but Origins also incorporates a number of elements from modern action games in an attempt to evolve the series and broaden its appeal."
"As you're roaming the battlefield, cutting down hordes of soldiers and capturing bases, you'll regularly come face-to-face with named enemy officers who are much more potent than the average grunt. At this point, Origins seamlessly transitions to a style of combat built around precise timing and judicious use of your skills (known as Arts). By guarding at just the right moment, you can parry incoming attacks and follow up with a powerful attack of your own. Not only is this gratifying--as steel clashes with steel and your opponent is momentarily knocked back--but these counterattacks also chip away at an officer's Fortitude. This aura of protective energy surrounds each named enemy and, when fully broken, leaves them vulnerable to an Assault, which sees you launch into a stylish series of strikes that deal massive damage to your defenseless foe."
"Some enemy attacks can't be parried, requiring you to either dodge or use a specific Art to disrupt the incoming strike. You can enter battle equipped with up to four different Arts, as each weapon type offers a variety of these unique attacks to choose from. Some are excellent at clearing the battlefield with big, broad swings--creating powerful shockwaves or miniature tornados--while others are more precise and suited to one-on-one duels. Whichever ones you opt for, Arts are typically fun to unleash and add another layer of depth to Origins' combat, even if it's often just another way to obliterate the regular rank and file with relative ease."
"What's most impressive is how cohesive the transition between these two divergent combat styles feels. Origins recaptures the hack-and-slash essence of Dynasty Warriors and pushes the series forward by blending formulas, creating an experience that feels both familiar and unique. It's still inherently repetitive, but the fusion of combat styles makes for a much more engaging and active game that's elevated beyond being a by-the-numbers power fantasy."
"The nine available weapon types also play a role in easing the dearth of playable characters. Ranging from swords and spears to more specialized armaments like twin pikes and crescent blades, each weapon type feels different enough from the rest to stand out. The Podao, for instance, is designed around slow but devastating charged attacks, while the Wheels are at their most effective when you're able to attack in a rhythmic flow. You also have access to various Tactics, where you can issue orders to a small squad of soldiers, commanding volleys of arrows and cavalry charges to decimate the enemy ranks."
"This feeds into an emphasis on strategy that's present in most missions, as you're given the freedom to assess the situation and decide where you're needed most, whether that's helping a particular ally, capturing bases, or forging ahead to take out officers on the front line. Successfully retaking control of bases and defeating officers increases your army's morale, making them much more proficient fighters. Not only are they able to capture territory without your aid, but they also provide real assistance when fighting by your side."
"All of this comes to a head in the final stages of most missions when a massive number of soldiers gather to create two Large Forces. These cinematic skirmishes are exhilarating, with hundreds of soldiers lined up, ready to charge into battle. Running alongside this pulsating crowd before violently colliding with the enemy makes you feel like a Rohirrim charging into a swarm of orcs at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Except you're also a one-man army, able to wipe out hundreds of peons and further batter their morale by defeating numerous officers along the way. It's just a shame there's no co-op after it was such a significant feature in previous games. These epic battles are ripe for experiencing with a friend by your side."
"Instead, you spend Origins' campaign fighting alongside and against the likes of Liu Bei, Cao Cao, and Sun Jian. As a new character, you're not aligned with any faction, so the first few chapters see you joining forces with everyone. Once you reach Chapter 3, however, you have a pivotal choice to make as you're forced to side with one of the aforementioned warriors. From here, the game branches into three distinct campaigns and makes it easy to go back after you've finished one and play through the rest. This adds heaps of replayability if you're itching for more, although the game's repetition is in danger of collapsing into monotonous territory at this point."
"Dynasty Warriors: Origins is an ambitious game that forcefully pushes the reset button after the failings of Dynasty Warriors 9. It's a marked improvement on that game in almost every area, utilizing modern technology to expand upon its hack-and-slash core while implementing a more considered and action-oriented approach that enhances its exorbitant combat. Longtime fans are likely downtrodden by its minuscule roster and lack of co-op, and the story has a habit of clogging the game's pacing with too many redundant conversations, but these shortcomings mostly fade into the background once you're entrenched in the heat of battle. At that moment, there are few sights better than a dozen peons hurtling helplessly through the air."
"I didn't expect much from Sonic the Hedgehog 3. The first movie was a nice little diversion from COVID, but the sequel was quite irritating--and with the same director and writers back for another go-around, I figured we were in for another round of ""more of the same."" Fortunately for all of us, I was wrong: The threequel successfully reins in the pop culture references and Jim Carrey's wackiness just enough, while also giving us a serious villain for the first time with Keanu Reeves's Shadow, and the result is that Sonic the Hedgehog 3 works better for audiences of all ages than its predecessors, which were more squarely aimed at children."
"Sonic 3 picks up some time after the last movie, and the Wachowskis have adopted Tails and Knuckles along with Sonic--they've got a nice little family unit going. Robotnik, meanwhile, is very depressed, just hanging out in his crab mech binge-eating snacks and binge-watching telenovelas. In other words, all is well. At least until an unknown person manages to free the mysterious Shadow the Hedgehog from stasis, letting him loose to pursue revenge for something that happened long ago and putting him into conflict with Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles."
"That unknown person was, it turns out, another Dr. Robotnik--grandpa to the one we know (but still played by Jim Carrey). Robotnik Sr. and Shadow are allies, having shared a deep trauma decades earlier that is driving them both to extreme lengths for revenge. The younger Robotnik, the one who was a bad guy in the other two movies, serves as a wild card, because he wants to team up with his grandad but has a pretty different ultimate goal."
"The plot is messy and doesn't quite add up. For example: One major character, GUN director Rockwell (Krysten Ritter), positions herself as an antagonist but then bows out of the movie halfway through, and it's hard to tell what point there was in including her. But it's easier to overlook potential plot holes like that one this time out because the movie's tone is more controlled than the last one was."
"Look at the Robotniks, for example. Jim Carrey is still a complete weirdo in his dual roles, but it doesn't feel like he's riffing the whole time the way it did in the last one. Part of that is likely because of the technical restraints--Carrey shares most of his scenes with himself, and it's more difficult to improv in that kind of filmmaking situation. But that's a great thing for the movie, because it keeps Carrey from crossing the threshold into being outright annoying too often, and his jokes now hit more than miss. Though when he does miss, it's still pretty grating."
"The inclusion of Shadow the Hedgehog as the other villain also helps restrain the goofiness, because he's actually a serious character, unlike previous antagonists Robotnik and Knuckles (the latter's shtick working much better in a supporting protagonist role this time). Shadow's seriousness, aided by Keanu Reeves's tired and sad line delivery, gives Sonic 3 a marked heft that the first two movies did not have at all."
"That's also nice because it gives us a bad guy who can match the earnestness of Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles. Shadow is the angry counterpart to Sonic's carefree nature, a dark vision of what Sonic might have turned out like had things gone differently for him. Reeves would be great for the part in a vacuum, but he's also particularly effective as a counter to Ben Schwartz's happy-go-lucky delivery as Sonic. Schwartz once again does solid work as the speedster, though he's been so consistent through all three movies that it feels like faint praise at this point. He was and continues to be the right guy for the job."
"The other key returning human characters--Tom (James Marsden), Maddie (Tika Sumpter), and Stone (Lee Majdoub)--have a little bit less to do in this one, but that doesn't dampen their enthusiasm any. The three actors are super comfortable in these roles and are clearly having a blast, and that vibe is infectious. Stone in particular has become a uniquely fun character, because he's just a genuinely nice, smart, and hot dude who just happens to be an evil henchman. It's a very unusual characterization."
"It's not hard to figure out why the humans took a bit of a backseat this time--with the addition of Shadow, there are four CGI main characters now, and the movie leaves most of the third act to them and the Robotniks as they do battle in outer space. Finding a place to use Marsden and Sumpter during this part would have been more trouble than it's worth, and the immense success of the Super Mario Bros. Movie demonstrated quite clearly that it's OK to leave behind the grounding elements and go all in on the video game stuff. The result is that the final battle in Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is far bigger in scope than the climactic fights from either of the previous flicks, and the entirely CGI action sequences are gorgeous and very well directed. These are easily the best sequences in this series thus far."
"Sonic the Hedgehog 3 succeeds not because it's a complete shakeup for the series--it isn't that at all--but rather because it refines the franchise template in the right way, swapping out a lot of the pop-culture references for more original humor and putting more of the focus on the game characters. This Sonic film took itself just a bit more seriously than the first two did, without going overboard and turning grim and gritty--director Jeff Fowler and co. found the right balance this time around."
"Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver was ahead of its time when it launched in 1999 for the original PlayStation. From its storytelling and worldbuilding to the technical prowess behind its interconnected world and innovative Realm shifting, developer Crystal Dynamics created a near-masterpiece of environmental and narrative design, with ideas and concepts that still resonate to this day."
"Now, 25 years later--and 21 years since the last game in the series--Legacy of Kain makes its overdue return with Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1&2 Remastered, bundling together two of the greatest action-adventure games of all time. Developed in partnership with Crystal Dynamics and Aspyr--the latter of which recently launched the similarly packaged Tomb Raider I-III Remastered--this bundle reintroduces the world to vampire protagonist Raziel and his quest for revenge against the eponymous Kain. With improved visuals and a modern control scheme, it's a solid remaster that, above all, showcases why these games are so revered."
"Set in the decaying land of Nosgoth--where vampires are apex predators and humans cower within walled cities--the first Soul Reaver begins with Raziel committing the sin of surpassing his master, Kain, in evolution. As the self-proclaimed king of Nosgoth, Kain sired and raised Raziel as his eldest lieutenant and son, tasking him and his four brothers with besieging the land and decimating humanity to ensure his despotic rule. By growing a set of wings, however, Raziel is deemed to have threatened Kain's supremacy and is thrown into the Lake of the Dead to suffer for all eternity. After rotting for centuries, Raziel is resurrected by a dormant god and set on a path of vengeance to seek out his brothers and kill them before doing the same to Kain."
"This sets up a relatively straightforward plot that's enriched and broadened by excellent writing throughout. Written and directed by Amy Hennig--who would later go on to pen the first three Uncharted games--Soul Reaver exhibits a cinematic flair that was uncommon at the time of its release. Inspired in part by John Milton's iconic poem, Paradise Lost, there's an ornate style to the game's writing, permeating a sense of gravitas that's wonderfully brought to life by a cast of trained stage actors. It's a rich, gothic tale of authentic vampire mythology, yet Soul Reaver and its sequel also confront more philosophical themes such as free will, predestination, and cyclical violence, supplementing both games' fantastic worldbuilding and adding depth to their characters and their motivations."
"Part of the reason why the writing is so effective is because it's reflected in Nosgoth itself. In the first Soul Reaver, what was previously a grandiose land is now eternally decayed. ""Once a testament to mankind's defiance of Kain's empire, this towering cathedral now stood derelict, the humans who worshipped here, centuries dead,"" Raziel says upon entering the Silenced Cathedral. This spiral minaret was constructed as a holy weapon, intended to blast a deadly hymn that would destroy every vampiric creature in Nosgoth: ""a colossal instrument of brass and stone."" Before it could serve its purpose, however, the cathedral was attacked and its weapon disabled--the massive reverberating pipes fell silent."
"When Raziel arrives, you need to traverse the labyrinthian depths of the Silenced Cathedral, manipulating the airflow of these pipes to ascend the tower and reach the upper spires where one of your brothers resides. It's this marriage between mechanics, story, and worldbuilding that distinguishes Soul Reaver as a triumph in game design. Whether you're exploring the murky waters of the Drowned Abbey or unveiling the mysteries of The Tomb of the Sarafan, each part of Nosgoth is drenched in this same intertwined excellence."
"At the time of its release, it was also a technical marvel, utilizing level streaming to create a seamless, interconnected 3D world with no loading screens. We might take level streaming for granted now, but Soul Reaver was one of the early pioneers of the technology. What's more impressive, and still endures to this day, is the game's ambitious Realm shifting. When Raziel awakens from his eternal torment, he's been stripped of his vampiric glory and is now a wraith, cursed to feed on souls instead of blood. Trapped inside an eroded husk with his wings now ragged, Raziel can shift between two overlapping Realms: the Material and the Spectral. In the latter, the physical Realm becomes distorted, warping the geometry of the world around you. Impassible obstacles like water simply dissipate--it has neither heft nor lift--fissures in rocky walls transform into open passages, and platforms contort to reveal new pathways."
"With improved visuals and a modern control scheme, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1&2 Remastered is a solid remaster that, above all, showcases why these games are so revered"
"Compared to other 3D titles available at the time, the scale of Soul Reaver already felt huge. Being able to shift between two concurrently loaded realms in real-time, essentially forcing you to consider each room as two separate rooms, was just the cherry on top. It's fascinating and never felt like a gimmick, providing a platform for many of the game's environmental puzzles."
"These conundrums take up the bulk of your time, whether you're lining up blocks to complete murals, reactivating antiquated machinery to open the path forward, or ringing two bells to smash a glass wall with their thundering soundwaves. For the most part, Soul Reaver's puzzles are engaging, even if some variation of each one has appeared in other games since. The frequency of block-pushing puzzles is much too high, though, which quickly becomes tedious. The game's save system is also odd and is one area of the remaster where things should've been altered. You can save your progress at any time, but loading one of these saves always sends you back to the game's start point. Warp Gates can be used to teleport back to where you were, but this forces you to replay sections over again, adding needless backtracking to a game that already requires you to run back through previously visited areas on multiple occasions."
"Fortunately, Soul Reaver 2 features a more traditional save system, letting you save and reload at specific checkpoints. This is presumably because the sequel is a leaner, more streamlined game than its predecessor, lacking any of the optional side areas of the first game. Its puzzles are also more diverse, focusing on the different elemental powers Raziel unlocks throughout the game with some complex riddles. The sequel's dearth of bosses is disappointing, though, and even with some improvements to combat--like adding a block and more weapon variety--fighting enemies is still secondary to exploration and puzzle-solving."
"Combat does have its merits, however. Vampires can't be killed by simply hitting them enough times. Instead, you need to rough them up until they're weak enough to be grabbed, then either burn them in sunlight, drown them in water, or impale them on spikes before siphoning their souls. This forces you to observe your surroundings in the midst of battle; launching a vampire onto a 10-foot-high spike is always exhilarating. Combat is the most archaic aspect of both games, but there are still some interesting ideas here that deftly merge with other aspects of each game's design."
"In terms of what was changed for this remaster, one of the most significant improvements is that both games now feature full control of the camera, letting you adjust it with the right stick. Not being able to do this is a major barrier to entry when attempting to replay the original games, so this puts them more in line with modern third-person games. Raziel's still not the smoothest character to control, but there are only a couple of irritating sections in the first game where precise platforming is required. Figuring out where to go next is another occasional issue with the original due to the game's open nature and non-existent map. The remaster alleviates this somewhat by adding a compass and world map, along with a bit of text that states the current objective, but neither is particularly impactful. The compass is only helpful during the few instances when a character tells you to head in a specific direction, while the world map essentially functions as a key for each of the warp gate's symbols. Although it is a nice touch to include a depiction of Nosgoth's geography for the first time."
"The visual upgrade is the most obvious change, with more detailed character models and textures, modern lighting effects, and dynamic shadows. Some were worried prior to release because both games looked too bright in early screenshots, losing their original dark and gothic aesthetics, but that's not the case in the final release. You can instantly toggle between the new graphics and the old, and it maintains the same gritty mood in both. In fact, the remaster feels like it's slapped a new lick of paint on the original games more than anything. There's a definitive improvement, but it's underwhelming that a few notable blemishes still remain, whether it's the Soul Reaver blade frequently clipping through the floor or the dated fire and water effects that appear unchanged."
"Beyond this, the remaster also has a plethora of bonus material to dive into, including explorations of the series' lore, tons of artwork and renders, old demo videos, outtakes from the recording sessions, a music player, and a number of lost levels you can now play for the first time. These old relics are comparable to an interactive museum, letting you explore unfinished areas that were cut from the original game due to time restraints, budget issues, or creative decisions. It's a fascinating look at the game's development and what might have been if things had gone differently."
"It can sometimes be tough to appreciate games from the past because so much of game design is built on iteration. That isn't a problem with Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1&2 Remastered. There are archaic elements to both games, yet it's surprising just how well they hold up today. There's no doubt that improvements to the game's controls and, to a lesser extent, their visuals contribute to this, but the main reason they persevere is because of their masterful melding of story, worldbuilding, and mechanics with a handful of innovative ideas. Much like Raziel, this isn't a perfect revival, but it preserves a pair of classic games and, in an ideal world, will attract a new audience to a series that has been dormant for far too long. Hopefully, this is just the beginning of its resurgence."
"When the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers emerged as many Americans' first exposure to the popular Super Sentai series, it was hard not to feel like it was riding the wave of Turtle-mania that defined the early 1990s. After all, it was a band of color-coordinated heroes who traded gentle quips and used martial arts to dispatch endless faceless baddies. I watched MMPR at the time, but I was also just cresting the age at which I felt a little embarrassed by its undeniable camp. Three decades later, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind once again feels a bit like it's riding the turtles' coattails. TMNT: Shredder's Revenge was an excellent retro brawler throwback, and by comparison, Rita's Rewind is a pretty good retro brawler throwback, but one with some of its own special charms--as well as its own frustrations."
"Rita's Rewind fully recognizes the passage of time, even pinning down specific years. The original Rangers are still fighting evil in 2023, now against a mechanized Robo Rita--a timely reference to the villain of the reunion movie, 2023's Power Rangers: Once and Always. But apparently overwhelmed by these Rangers who have decades of experience, Robo Rita hatches a plan to go back in time and team up with her flesh-and-blood self. The modern-day Rangers say it's too dangerous to follow her through time and risk a paradox, so they just have to hope their younger selves are able to withstand the machinations of two Ritas."
"That places Rita's Rewind strictly on the 1993 timeline, which means it's the first time the Rangers are encountering mainstays like Goldar and the Green Ranger. The only real difference is that this time we see Rita Repulsa bickering with Robo Rita over strategy."
"That self-aware setting makes this ripe for callbacks, like some of the earliest and most iconic monsters in Power Rangers history. Your progress is divided into stages, but also episodes, as the same monster will typically span three stages to make a complete episodic story. It's a cute hook that cleverly invokes nostalgia for the classic, campy TV show. At one point there's even a clever homage to the trailblazing game Final Fight."
"Most of the stages are typical brawler fare, as your chosen Ranger takes on a variety of Putties (and occasionally Tengas) with their own themed attacks. Light-blue Putties, for example, will run straight towards you with a spike, but if you successfully dodge, they'll crash into a wall and get dizzy for a few seconds. None of the enemies are particularly bright, but they're built to overwhelm you with numbers. Your moveset is limited to a few basic attacks, jump-kicks, and dash-moves, but it's generally enough to deal with the enemy hordes. For times when you might get overwhelmed, there's a super attack you can unleash after collecting enough Power Coins to charge it, and it almost always clears the field."
"The Rangers are well differentiated in their animations, which help to express their individual personalities. The Black Ranger Zack's down-smash attack breaks out his power axe, for example, while the Pink Ranger Kimberly shoots down like an arrow and strikes a pose like she just stuck the landing in a gymnastic event. It's cute. That said, their individual attack strength, range, and speed feel effectively the same. That makes picking your Ranger more a matter of personal preference than strategy. The super attacks similarly have different screen-filling effects, but when they all clear the board, there's not a functional difference."
"Sometimes brawler stages are interrupted by a Time Disrupter, a green device that will rewind everything if you don't destroy it quickly enough. That's an inventive little twist, since you have to juggle dealing with Putties while also trying to damage the Time Disrupter, or you'll have to fight the same Putties over again. But the Time Disrupter retains whatever damage you did, so you can chip it down over multiple rounds. Sometimes this can even work to your advantage--once I lost a life while a Time Disrupter was active, then time rewound and I got the life back and performed better to keep it."
"In between stages, you hang out at the local juice bar, where you can talk a little to other characters or play simple arcade games. It's a sweet little diversion that helps sell the feeling of watching an old Power Rangers episode."
"Most episodes culminate in a vehicle-chase segment with your individual prehistoric-themed robot, which in true Power Rangers fashion, usually then transitions to a big MegaZord brawl. These are rendered with a retro Mode-7-esque effect and are styled like arcade shooters, firing your weapons to get temporary power-ups to more swiftly take down the enemy ships flying towards you. The MegaZord battle is more akin to a first-person Punch-Out, as you shift left or right to dodge attacks and then wail on your super-sized enemy to charge up the Power Sword, which rains down from the sky to deliver your finishing strike."
"These stages seem intended to break up the pacing, but they're often frustrating. The hit detection in the vehicle segments is imprecise and hard to judge thanks to the Mode-7-like effects, so it's easy to sustain a hit and die or, worse, get crushed by a piece of geometry. That means you lose a life. But unlike the regular brawler stages where you continue right where you left off, these start you back at an often arbitrary-feeling checkpoint. If that's before a boss that you had nearly beaten, it means you're starting from scratch with the boss at full health. It can be easy to lose all three allotted lives, which then prompts you to use a continue--a limited resource on most difficulty levels, which starts you back from the beginning of the whole stage."
"The big boss-finishing MegaZord segments feel strangely off in a different way. Dodging is floaty and imprecise, and getting hit resets the meter to build up your Power Sword. But there also doesn't seem to be any damage. If it's even possible to die in these segments, I never saw it. There are green, yellow, and red lights in the MegaZord cockpit that seem intended to signify damage, but they never lit up. It's possible that these segments are meant to be impossible to lose, and the only penalty is delay, because it's supposed to feel big and empowering. But it seems just as possible that, faced with imprecise dodging that would make damage too frustrating, the developers just opted to make you invincible."
"Like a classic brawler, Rita's Rewind can be finished in a few hours, and once you're done, there's not much reason to replay. There is a bonus unlockable character that you can play with, but they handle mostly similarly to the other Rangers. The Rangers don't level up with experience, and there isn't a currency or shop to buy bonuses or extras. The stages do have bonus objectives, but it isn't clear what completing them gives you other than bragging rights. There are multiple difficulty modes to test your skills, of course, and there is a Speed Run mode with an on-screen timer, if replaying the game to top your best time strikes your fancy."
"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind feels light and disposable. It's a largely enjoyable brawler throwback that plays well and accurately captures the spirit of the original old-school Power Rangers. The vehicle segments can be frustrating, but the larger issue with MMPR is that it's ephemeral. Like watching an episode of Power Rangers on a lazy afternoon, you'll have a little campy fun and then immediately forget about it."
"For my money, there isn't a better horror monster than The Thing's shape-shifting alien organism. Even 42 years later, Rob Bottin's practical effects are still incredible, capturing each freakish amalgamation of tentacles, sharp teeth, sinew, and traces of malformed humanity with ghastly clarity. I've seen The Thing dozens of times, yet seeing Norris' decapitated head contort and grow arthropod-esque legs will never fail to twist my stomach in knots. These are the everlasting images of The Thing, but it's the alien's ability to perfectly imitate anyone that genuinely terrifies, permeating each scene with an unnerving sense of dread and paranoia that affects both its characters and the audience watching. Who do you trust when anyone could be a clandestine threat?"
"Back in 2002, developer Computer Artworks attempted to translate this feeling into an officially licensed video game for The Thing. The now-shuttered studio came close to succeeding, too, creating a third-person horror-action game with a unique squad system that ensured you could never entirely trust the person fighting by your side. It's become somewhat of a cult classic since then, leading to this remaster from Nightdive Studios--a developer known for faithfully restoring myriad games, including Shadow Man and Star Wars: Dark Forces. The Thing: Remastered is a similarly authentic experience, albeit with a number of key improvements to the game's visuals, controls, and some quality-of-life mechanics. Beyond this, it's much the same game as it was in 2002, for both the good and the bad."
"The game's setup is one of its better aspects, acting as a direct sequel to John Carpenter's iconic 1982 film. You play as the bland, one-dimensional Captain Blake, leader of a U.S. Special Forces rescue team sent to investigate Outpost 31 in the isolating tundra of Antarctica. Of course, we know what transpired when MacReady and the rest of this research facility encountered the shape-shifting alien life-form, and it doesn't take long before Blake is fighting off all manner of horrific entities. He's rather nonchalant about the whole thing, though, anchoring a relatively thin story that feels distinctly 2002 in all the worst ways. While it begins as a more action-oriented facsimile of the film it's ostensibly a sequel to, the narrative quickly delves into predictable territory with the military experimenting on the Thing to use the alien for its own gain. It's all very stereotypical, with melodramatic voice acting and--aside from a fun cameo from John Carpenter himself--an inherently disposable cast of characters."
"Most of the people you meet are potential squad members. To survive The Thing: Remastered, earning and maintaining the trust of the surviving crew is paramount. By killing enemies and supplying each squadmate with weapons, ammo, and healing, they'll happily fight alongside you. The twist is that this is The Thing, so you could be handing a weapon to an enemy interloper or someone paranoid enough to suspect you of being one yourself. Not only can your squad members be a Thing in disguise, but they also have the capacity to turn on you if their trust diminishes or they're overcome by fear. They regularly experience anxiety, which spikes when witnessing traumatic events, such as seeing a dismembered corpse or a particularly grotesque alien. If they suffer from enough stress or lose your trust--because you accidentally shot them, didn't take part in combat, and so on--they'll crack and run away, kill themselves, or start shooting everyone around them, attempting to kill both you and your colleagues."
"It's a thoughtful implementation of the film's tenants of trust, paranoia, and deception, with the potential to generate nail-biting tension through friend and foe alike. Suddenly, your squadmates are more than just simple NPCs; they're people displaying real human behavior. It was an innovative concept back in 2002 when this kind of trust and fear management was unheard of. Even today, it's not something I've seen implemented in other single-player games; typically, it's reserved for social multiplayer experiences like Among Us instead."
"The Thing: Remastered is [an] authentic experience, albeit with a number of key improvements to the game's visuals, controls, and some quality-of-life mechanics. Beyond this, it's much the same game as it was in 2002, for both the good and the bad"
"For the game's first couple of hours, the way these ideas are executed is compelling. The Thing: Remastered immediately establishes an unsettling atmosphere as you begin exploring the dilapidated remnants of Outpost 31. Your teammates are already on edge even before you discover a flying saucer buried under the ice, with the howl of the Arctic's bitingly cold wind and Ennio Morricone's haunting score punctuating certain moments with another alluring layer of unease. Nightdive has done a fantastic job of updating the original game's visuals, too, with improved character models, textures, and animations, as well as dynamic lighting and shadows to really spruce up the 22-year-old game. It still maintains the somewhat blocky look of a game from the PS2 era but smoothes over its rougher edges with modern techniques that make the visuals more palatable for a modern audience."
"As you progress further into the game, you'll come up against all manner of enemy creatures, from small four-legged scuttlers to more humanoid monstrosities with deadly claws and exposed innards. These larger enemies need to be damaged with small-arms fire before being set alight with either a flamethrower or incendiary grenade. Fortunately, Nightdive has altered the flamethrower so that it doesn't burn you if you're holding the trigger while simultaneously moving forward. Ammunition is also much more plentiful, preventing those instances in the original game where you would be forced to reload a save from hours before to try and conserve enough ammo for later. Aside from these welcome changes, combat in The Thing: Remastered feels much the same, utilizing a generous lock-on system that makes it easy to clear out rooms without much thought. It's fine but hardly compelling."
"Your teammates aren't too shabby in a fight, at least, though their main purpose is often to open doors for you. The game's level design is commonly built on gating your progression with broken junction boxes that prevent things like doors and computers from working. While you're able to fix some of this damaged equipment, most of them require a specialized engineer, creating one of the first issues with the game's notion that ""anyone could be an alien."" If you require an engineer to progress, then their death or transformation simply results in a game over screen, removing the potential for the type of randomness that makes the game's concept so enticing. The more you play, the more it's revealed that The Thing: Remastered is essentially struggling under the weight of its own ambition. Certain squad members will become aliens at pre-determined points, no matter how carefully you've managed their trust and fear. Even if a blood test reveals that they're still human mere seconds before, this is quickly rendered moot by the game's rigid scripting."
"As a result, The Thing: Remastered falters as a squad-based game because you're never incentivized to care about anyone's survival but your own. With the story dictating when certain characters will transform--and most teammates disappearing at the end of each level anyway--forming any sort of attachment to them is futile. There are no repercussions for trusting your teammates, either. Any weapons you give them are dropped when they transform, and keeping their trust up and fear down is a simple task, so I never felt like anyone would crack, which gradually chips away at the game's tension. By the halfway point, Computer Artworks seemingly struggled to take the concept any further, turning the game into a boilerplate run-and-gun shooter that sees you fighting aliens and mindless human enemies alike. It's a far cry from the game's opening and makes for a banal slog towards a disappointing ending."
"I have fond memories of playing The Thing back in 2002 because there wasn't anything else quite like it. It was inventive and exciting, and even today, no one else is trying to do what Computer Artworks attempted in the single-player space. I commend the studio for what it achieved, but the limitations of the technology--and its design constraints--are much more apparent now, even with nostalgia-tinted glasses on. Nightdive has done a fantastic job of restoring this flawed but intriguing game, continuing its crucial work with game preservation. All of the changes it's made are positive, resulting in a better game, both visually and mechanically. Nonetheless, this is a case where a complete remake would've been much more appealing, allowing for the trust and fear system to be fleshed out with less rigidity and more dynamism. As it is, Computer Artworks' vision might never be fully realized, and that's a shame."
"The second level in Indiana Jones and The Great Circle takes Indy inside the bowels of Vatican City. It's the first time when MachineGames breaks loose from its linear shackles, presenting you with a massive play area to freely explore. I went from gawking at Michelangelo's masterpiece on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel to exploring the ancient ruins hidden deep beneath the holy city, spending more than three hours on this single level alone without coming close to completing every task in Indy's journal."
"It's not quite what I expected from a studio known for its frenetic shooters, nor a game that's been described as a first-person action-adventure. For the most part, The Great Circle is a stealth game that resembles Dishonored more than any of MachineGames' previous output. Sure, you could skulk through the shadows in Wolfenstein, plunging knives into Nazi spines, but it was a shooter first and foremost. The Great Circle has moments of action, but its violence is sudden and tends to end quickly, indicative of Indiana Jones as a character; it wouldn't make sense if he were running and gunning like BJ Blazkowicz. It's a refreshing change of pace for the studio, and it's a rip-roaring good time, even if the inexperience of creating this sort of game sometimes shows."
"In terms of story and tone, MachineGames definitely understood the assignment. The Great Circle's prologue is essentially a love letter to Raiders of the Lost Ark, immediately making it clear how much the studio both grasps and reveres the series and its globe-trotting protagonist. This feeling persists throughout the entire game, beginning with an opening level that takes place inside the fictional walls of Marshall College, where Indy teaches archeology. The Great Circle is set between the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade, weaving into the existing fabric of the series in a way that makes it feel like a natural extension of Indy's story. A few familiar faces return, and new characters seamlessly blend into its cinematic world, contributing to a compelling adventure that sees you travel the world, uncover ancient mysteries, and butt heads with the Axis powers."
"The Great Circle does a fantastic job of nailing the look and sound of the 43-year-old series. The triumphant score by composer Gordy Haab captures the essence of John Williams's iconic original; Indy looks like he's stepped right out of the silver screen, and Troy Baker does a wonderful impression of the famed treasure hunter, perfecting both his voice and physical mannerisms. It's often almost impossible to tell you're not listening to a young, charismatic Harrison Ford, which is also a credit to the game's writing and how it achieves Indy's charm, distinct humor, and all-consuming passion for history and archeology. Emmerich Voss, a Nazi archeologist for the Third Reich Special Antiquities Collection, also acts as a compelling foil to Indy. He's manipulative and sneeringly evil while also sharing similar traits with our hero, mirroring Indy's obsession with a much more twisted moral compass."
"In an effort to stop Voss and his fascist underlings, The Great Circle takes you across the globe, from the looming shadows of the Great Pyramids to a Nazi battleship teetering precariously on top of a Himalayan mountain. Each location is meticulously detailed and clearly researched, recreating specific places from the films--like Marshall College--and actual historical sites alike, balancing fiction and history in a way the best Indiana Jones tales often do."
"I spent way too long roaming the halls of Indy's collegiate workplace, observing all of the trimmings in his office and examining each display case in its museum. The first-person perspective and tactile nature of everything you do makes for a wonderfully immersive experience. The in-game map, for instance, is a physical item you can pull out and look at while exploring; unlocking doors requires you to take out a key and turn it in the lock, and many of the puzzles are solved by grabbing and using items in the environment, whether you're placing cogwheels in an ancient contraption or pouring wine into specific altars."
"Puzzles often play out like environmental riddles, challenging you to observe your surroundings to figure out a solution. Others see you consulting Indy's journal, which tracks and catalogs your adventure with notes, photos, and clues that you take and gather yourself. There are two difficulty settings for puzzles: The default setting and another that makes them easier. I stuck with the default, and aside from a few tricky conundrums in some of the later side quests, I didn't find The Great Circle's multi-layered puzzles particularly difficult. Most were rather simple, in fact, but the game's tactile nature, lush environments, and blending of tone and mechanics meant that I still enjoyed solving each one."
"There's some light platforming involved, too, letting you use Indy's iconic whip to swing over chasms and descend into dusty tombs. The slow process of climbing, mantling, and shimmying across ledges is quite stale--and the awkward shifts between first- and third-person aren't handled as elegantly as they could be--but I did appreciate the lack of yellow paint and how this forces you to scrutinize the environment before barreling forward. There's still the occasional white cloth blowing in the wind or tied to some ledges, but they're less noticeable."
[Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is] a refreshing change of pace for the studio and it's a rip-roaring good time
"When you're not rummaging through centuries-old catacombs and discovering hidden treasures, most of your time is spent avoiding the prying eyes of patrolling Nazis. There are guns in The Great Circle, but I never felt compelled to fire any of them. Firearms were never a first, second, or even third option for dealing with the game's enemies, partly because of the game's strong focus on making you feel like Indiana Jones, but also because there's a lot of freedom and player expression in how you can approach enemies. Particularly in its larger and more open-ended levels, there are multiple solutions to almost every combat encounter, whether you're utilizing scaffolding to climb up and around a fascist checkpoint, crawling through a jagged hole in a fence, or donning a disguise to stroll right through the entrance. These immersive-sim elements are fairly light, but they imbue the game's stealth and exploration with a palpable sense of player agency."
"If you opt for the clandestine route, you'll find that stealth in The Great Circle is forgiving enough on the game's default difficulty to where you can sneak past Nazi patrols relatively quickly. It takes a while for guards to fully notice you, establishing a kinetic pace that's further complemented by some cinematic flourishes. To perform a stealth takedown, for instance, you need to grab a makeshift weapon from the environment. I can't count the amount of times I clobbered a Nazi over the head with all sorts of guitars, broomsticks, wine bottles, and dirty frying pans."
"It's satisfying, to say the least. And if you are spotted, it's not the end of the world. You can play fast and loose with the game's stealth systems because being seen typically only results in a small-scale brawl. Most enemies are keen to engage you in a fistfight rather than calling for backup, and it's rare for more than a few enemies to notice when things go awry. Indy's punches feel weighty and make a thunderous impact when they connect, which somewhat makes up for the enemy AI's predictable and slightly rigid attacks. Parrying is also simple to execute thanks to a generous timing window, and there are few feelings quite as satisfying as catching a Nazi's left hook before following up with a devastating haymaker of your own. Combat is quite shallow, however, and I could see some tedium creeping in, but only if I'd chosen to instigate too many fights."
"It's possible to avoid combat altogether if you're careful, but flitting between considered sneaking and bursts of chaotic brawling just feels right. Indy has always been a scrappy underdog going up against the might of the Third Reich. He's a superhero without any superpowers, but he's resourceful, resolute, and a master of improvisation. If going undetected doesn't work, knock some skulls together. If a fascist shows up to a fistfight with a gun, whip it out of his hands. Then, when more show up, pick up that same gun and use it as an impromptu melee weapon to beat them to a pulp. This is just another facet where MachineGames has captured the spirit of being Indiana Jones, resulting in a thrilling dynamic between stealth and action."
"There are a few smaller, more linear levels mixed in between the larger freeform ones that hone in on this dynamic. This is also where you're strapped into The Great Circle's veritable rollercoaster of histrionic set pieces, appropriating the intense action sequences for which the series is known. These moments tend to be fairly straightforward from a gameplay perspective, but they succeed in creating a large-scale spectacle, whether you're shooting down Japanese warplanes in Shanghai or hurtling down the side of a snow-covered mountain."
"The game's massive open-ended levels are the highlight, though. Not just because they provide multiple ways for you to complete objectives, but because your exploration is also rewarded with various side quests, secrets, and more. ""Fieldwork,"" as some optional missions are labeled, are more involved than the smaller Mysteries you'll find. They sometimes tie into the main adventure, adding more depth to the game's narrative, while others present intriguing standalone tales."
"One in Sukhothai revolves around finding a missing person who, it turns out, is trapped in a tomb full of mechanical apparatus that's controlled by directing the flow of water. Another, in Giza, relates to one of the secretive factions involved in the main story, sending you into the scorpion-infested caverns beneath the Great Sphinx to uncover more about their purpose. Mysteries, meanwhile, are smaller in scale. You might intercept correspondence between two enemies engaged in a code-breaking game or seek out some thieving primates who stole a key to one of the fascist's store rooms--where numerous goodies await."
"By completing these quests, you're rewarded with skill books, money, or one of the game's various collectibles. The Great Circle doesn't feature a traditional skill tree; instead, Indy learns new abilities by reading books scattered throughout the game. It makes sense since he's an archeologist and professor, and these skills are somewhat grounded, letting you improve your stamina or increase the power behind your punches. They're not the most exciting upgrades, but unlocking them via exploration feels organic."
"Indiana Jones and The Great Circle is the quintessential Indiana Jones game. It captures the look, sound, and spirit of the movies, presenting a riveting story with an unexpected focus on stealth and freeform exploration that satisfies even when certain aspects of its design are slightly underwhelming. More than anything, MachineGames has successfully designed a game around its protagonist; its mix of improvisational stealth and combat feels distinct by adopting a fast and loose style that echoes Indy's scrappy persistence. It might not be quite as accomplished in all areas as the studio's Wolfenstein games, but Indiana Jones and The Great Circle is still a frequent delight."
"It's incredible that Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl even exists. In addition to weathering the COVID-19 pandemic, developer GSC Game World was faced with the Russian invasion of its native Ukraine, kicking off a war that sadly still rages on today. While many GSC staff were able to flee the country, others were unable to, and some even continue to fight for their country on the war's frontlines. Amidst the terrifying sound of air-raid sirens and frequent missile attacks, people somehow persevered, continuing to work on the game at home in between volunteer work, all while suffering the loss of beloved friends, colleagues, family members, and pets. Even those who left Ukraine and began working at a new office in Prague weren't free of turbulence. Countless Russian cyberattacks, leaked builds, and even a fire that destroyed the studio's server room have all occurred over the past couple of years."
"Yet, despite all of this, Stalker 2 is here. Its release is nothing short of a miraculous achievement and a testament to the people who fought tooth and nail to reach this point in the face of unimaginable hardships. The game that emerged from such horrifying events is one that boldly sticks to the studio's vision of a seamless open-world survival shooter, which the series has always strived to be. It's rough around the edges and uncompromising in a way that is sometimes off-putting. Yet the series' emergent gameplay remains intact and is further complemented by a fascinating setting and the most accomplished combat in the series so far. It doesn't reinvent the wheel, and at times it feels like you're playing a game straight out of 2010, but that's part of its charm and feeds into what makes Stalker 2 the quintessential Stalker experience."
"If you're unfamiliar with GSC's post-apocalyptic world, each game takes place in an alternate version of the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone. Following the historical reactor meltdown of 1986, several laboratories were established in the surrounding area and began conducting various experiments. This led to a fictional second disaster in 2006 that mutated local plant and animal life and created phenomena known as anomalies. These strange, almost-supernatural occurrences cause valuable artifacts to appear, each containing unique and unexplainable properties. Stalkers come to the Zone in search of personal enrichment by recovering these artifacts, but they're not the only people who inhabit this irradiated area. Various factions exist within the Zone, from paramilitary organizations to groups of scientists seeking to understand the Zone, along with myriad bandits, religious fanatics, and outlaws who prefer to shoot first and ask questions later."
"Stalker 2's opening moments mirror the introduction to 2007's Shadow of Chornobyl, as your character is driven to the perimeter of the Zone in the back of a flatbed truck. Unlike the original game--where you played a nameless, amnesiac Stalker--you're cast as Skif, a young Stalker who's made his way into the Zone to conduct a covert experiment using a mysterious scanner and an even more mysterious artifact. After a brief tutorial introducing you to all that is weird and dangerous about the Zone, Skif is betrayed, robbed of all his gear, and wakes up to find a mutant dog gnawing at his toes."
"From here, Stalker 2 is similar to the first game as, once again, you attempt to track down the person who betrayed you. Your journey leads you to various settlements where you'll tackle numerous jobs to trade for information. It doesn't take long before the branching narrative expands to more world-altering ramifications, though. There's a concerted effort to provide more narrative heft than the previous games, both in the main story and the plethora of side quests you'll venture out on. Information is typically disclosed during involved conversations with full voice acting--including immersive Ukranian VO--and a Bethesda-style dialogue system that gives you a number of ways to reply, even if you simply want to initiate combat. This isn't an RPG, so you won't attempt to guide conversations by passing skill checks. Instead, dialogue choices provide a sense of agency and still allow you to role-play the type of Stalker you want to be."
"The writing is grounded but uneven at times and lacks nuance. It also tends to favor memorable moments as opposed to any particularly memorable characters. Yet I was always eager to see where the story was heading as I began to uncover the Zone's mysteries, solve some of its smaller conflicts, and navigate the politics of its differing factions. The choices you have to make are impactful, too, significantly altering events and how the world reacts to your decisions. Even after the end credits had rolled, I still questioned whether I made the right choices."
"This dynamic unpredictability is also present in Stalker 2's side quests. Whether you've been asked to recover a missing shipment or track down and kill a group of mercenaries, these missions are rarely ever cut and dried. There's usually someone willing to make a deal, perhaps giving up someone else to save their own skin or offering to cut you in on a valuable stash only they know the location of. The question is, do you trust them? Do you even trust the person who gave you the initial quest in the first place? Everyone in Stalker is in it for themselves and there's little room for morality when most characters won't hesitate to stab you in the back and hang you out to dry."
"While there's more breadth to the curated narrative in Stalker 2, its various systems are also still proficient at creating emergent stories for you to stumble upon and then engage with. At one point, my interest was piqued by the glowing embers of a campfire I could see through the open window of a nearby building. When I got close, those sitting inside were attacked by one of the Zone's mutated enemies. Suddenly, I found myself in the middle of a chaotic gunfight, battling side by side with these strangers to repel a grotesque threat. When the dust had settled, I traded gear with the survivors before going on my merry way. Later on, while traveling to my next quest objective, I was ambushed by a Bloodsucker--a tentacle-mouthed mutant that can turn invisible--and started running. In my panic, I encountered a vortex--one of the Zone's many anomalies--and quickly positioned myself between it and the Bloodsucker, luring the terrifying abnormality in until it was picked up and spat out again in a bloody clump."
"These are just two examples of disparate systems interacting with each other in satisfying ways, but also point to how being aware of your surroundings and using your knowledge of the Zone can benefit you in combat. Ammunition is scarce, and purchasing it is expensive, so any opportunity to defeat an enemy without firing a shot is a significant advantage. You can try the stealth route to save on bullets by knifing enemies in the back, but I found this overly difficult. Your foes tend to be eagle-eyed, and their movement is unpredictable to the point where most of my attempts at espionage fell flat almost immediately. It's a positive that enemies don't follow heavily scripted paths, but not when they're so proficient at spotting you."
"A well-placed headshot is generally lethal against humans, whereas body shots tend to feel like a waste of bullets with how many it takes to down someone. This infuses firefights with a palpable sense of danger, particularly early on. Ranged weapons feel suitably weighty, and managing the recoil of each one is the most pertinent challenge when it comes to landing accurate shots. This is easier said than done when you're under constant fire, leaning around corners to pick off a few enemies before dashing to another piece of cover to avoid the destructive blast of an incoming grenade. It lacks the fluidity and snappiness of most modern shooters, which is why combat can sometimes feel slightly archaic. But there's no denying that it's distinctly Stalker."
"Acquiring a scoped weapon makes the process slightly easier, but there's still this throughline of desperation present in most firefights. Combat is consistently challenging and frenetic, which lends each kill a high degree of satisfaction. And much of this is down to how adept the human AI is at putting you under pressure. Bandits will flush you out with grenades, attempt to flank you, and push forward when you're applying bandages to prevent you from catching your breath. The AI still isn't perfect--sometimes needlessly exposing themselves, crouching behind cover that isn't there, or standing still to give you a free shot--but human enemies are competent, for the most part."
"The same isn't true when it comes to Stalker 2's mutants. Aside from a couple of outliers, most have a repertoire consisting of either charging or leaping straight at you, highlighting your lack of movement options. There's no reliable way to dodge these attacks, but finding something elevated to stand on will confuse the AI long enough for you to pick them off as they run around in circles. This isn't fun, but it's effective and renders most mutant encounters a repetitive slog."
"Stalker 2 also isn't without its fair share of technical issues. I encountered three crashes to desktop throughout my time playing, and in two separate side quests I got locked into conversations multiple times, forcing a full restart to escape. I could prevent one of these from happening again by loading an earlier save and skipping the objective for that specific character; otherwise he would initiate the bugged conversation every time I tried to leave the settlement. The other instance of this bug simply blocked me from being able to continue the side quest. I also ran into another pair of side quests where the item I had to acquire never materialized. One of these solved itself after a patch, so at least GSC is already on top of fixing some of these issues."
"The other technical mishaps I encountered were related to the game's sound and visuals, such as objects and NPCs floating or clipping through the floor, enemies with no bodies, and a few instances of T-posing. On a few occasions, elements of the UI would disappear so I couldn't tell how much health or ammo I had left. Wall textures sometimes flickered incessantly. Gun sounds would occasionally not work, or I would hear a sound like rabid mutant dogs barking right next to me, except they were nowhere to be seen. There was also a moment where every time I looked down, the image would completely double itself. Fortunately, Stalker 2 does at least run well on my PC. I have a Ryzen 7 7800X3D and an RTX 3090 and achieved a consistent frame rate between 60 and 90fps with everything set to High. There were moments when it would dip lower in bustling settlements, and I could probably fiddle with the graphics setting to rectify this, but it was never egregious. At the time of publication, GSC Game World has released a large patch, indicating an intent to address some of the issues that may crop up."
"Ultimately, Stalker 2's torrent of technical problems are frustrating because they hamper the game's oppressive atmosphere. This consists of brutalist Soviet architecture of its government buildings to the family homes hastily abandoned and weathered by years of neglect, where the paint is cracked and peeling off the walls, broken furniture is messily strewn about the place, and the windows are either boarded up or broken. The sound of gunfire in the distance is the only thing that breaks the silence as you traverse an open field, only for it to cut off as you receive a radio message warning of an incoming Emission. Now you're sprinting into the flooded basement of the nearest factory as the sky begins to turn red and violent lightning strikes hit the ground above your head. There's an enigmatic beauty to the Zone and an otherworldliness that derives from its anomalies. Whether it's a pulsating ball of energy or a poppy field that puts you into a deep sleep you'll never wake from, exploring this irradiated playspace is alluring, not least because it's so dangerous."
"In an attempt to deepen this immersion, Stalker 2 adds a few survival mechanics, but they feel half-baked. Hunger, for instance, will accumulate over time and can impair your combat performance. I never let it get that far, though. It doesn't take long before you're drowning in bread and sausages to the point where you'll eat a few just to lower your encumbrance. As a result, the hunger system isn't something you'll ever think about, so it just feels superfluous. Sleeping is even more redundant. Getting a good night's rest will replenish your health, but you won't suffer the ill effects of sleep deprivation if you don't, so there were times when I would go days without touching a bed."
"Artifacts occupy a similar space. Despite the game's tutorial stating that you're best off heading to a quiet place to test and figure out what each one does, they're still functionally the same as in previous games. Their effects boil down to buffing your resistances to things like radiation and bleeding, so they're not as interesting as the game's tooltips initially make them sound. The Zone's economy also dictates that their best use is as a sellable asset. Wear and tear causes your guns to constantly jam, while damaged armor provides less protection against the elements. The cost of repairing both is exorbitant--along with the prices for ammo and weapon upgrades--so artifacts represent one of the few ways to overcome this, thanks to their high value. If their benefits were more appealing, choosing whether to sell or not would be a tough decision. With the economy the way it is, that choice is essentially taken out of your hands."
"Criticizing Stalker 2's technical issues is tough, simply because it's astounding that GSC managed to launch the game in the first place. Admittedly, this made it easier for me to overlook some of its irritating quirks, particularly when they weren't egregiously crashing the game. Yet even this might not have been the case if it also weren't an engrossing game. Stalker 2 is notably flawed in a few areas, yet these shortcomings tend to dissipate when a compelling, non-linear quest goes awry thanks to an unforeseen element forcing you into a frantic shootout. This unpredictability and the way its various systems interact to create anomalous stories sets Stalker 2 apart. Throw in a beguiling world and the fascinating mysteries hidden within, and it's difficult not to fall under its enticing spell."
"Editor's note: This review briefly showed an 8 as its score due to a CMS error, but 7 is the intended score."
"In Life is Strange: Double Exposure, Max once again feels only as interesting as the characters surrounding her, making her a driving force that isn't particularly compelling and a fairly flat protagonist. Even as the game explores her grief following the loss of Chloe (either via a painful fall-out or her death, depending upon your selection) and a new loss that occurs during Double Exposure's opening chapter, Deck Nine stumbles in giving these processes depth and emotional resonance."
"Despite this weak thread, Double Exposure is, admittedly, a visually impressive game with some well-executed narrative beats, an interesting twist on gameplay, and some endearing characters. However, it ultimately feels too similar to its predecessor in a few frustrating ways and suffers from inconsistent story quality and writing; this makes for an overall experience that lacks a lot of depth and falls short."
"Set a decade or so after the events of Life is Strange, Double Exposure follows Max--now an award-winning photographer--during her residency at Vermont's prestigious Caledon University. You soon learn that in the years between the first game and this new adventure, Max has suppressed her ability to time-travel, as she is now all too aware of the damage it can inflict. We are also quickly introduced to Max's two closest friends, the bold and charismatic poet Safi Llewellyn-Fayyad and meek geek-turned-astrophysicist Moses Murphy. Yet by the time the first chapter comes to a close, any sense of normalcy has been stripped away as we find Max thrust into a new traumatic situation: the sudden, violent death of one of Caledon University's most-beloved students."
"Ever the detective, Max takes it upon herself to figure out what happened. This is largely prompted by her discovering a new power that gives her a decisive edge in getting to the bottom of things: the ability to warp between universes. Double Exposure, as its name slyly implies, sees Max venture back and forth between two in particular. In the first of these universes, the student who was killed remains dead, forcing Max to navigate both her own grief and how a sudden loss can shake a community. In the other, however, the character is miraculously alive, albeit still in grave danger. The process of crossing between these two dimensions is what drives much of Double Exposure's gameplay; Whenever Max hits a dead end in one universe, she is prompted to travel to the other, where she may find key pieces of information, important items, or ways to circumvent physical barriers that exist in the other realm."
"The decision to add this mechanic rather than solely relying upon Max's ability to time travel is a good one; It's fun and changes things up just enough from the original Life is Strange while still feeling in line with Max's pre-existing power. However, her immediate use of it with next to no hesitation did feel a bit off, considering her acute awareness of the disaster her time-traveling wrought. Though the player is largely responsible for Max's actions and beliefs, this is a recurring issue in Double Exposure, as Max ultimately comes across as having no real convictions or personality outside of a fondness for delivering Gilmore Girls-esque pop culture quips."
"Furthermore, this dimension-hopping feels far more inconsequential than Max's time-traveling in Life is Strange, as it essentially just allows Max to have conversations using supernaturally accrued knowledge and snoop around offices. Perhaps this then explains her leniency with it, though I'd argue the damage it does to the overall experience is more important than justifying her nonchalance."
"Whereas the original game leaned a bit too hard into Degrassi-style melodrama, the stakes were much greater and tense situations were plentiful, ultimately making for a more compelling experience. Though Double Exposure has some stellar dramatic moments, a couple that hit home, and a few interesting twists, they are few and far between. And more frustratingly, there exist a few moments that should have been more dramatic, given the ongoing situation, but simply aren't."
"Another factor that leads to this disconnect and the game's overall lack of passion, for lack of a better word, comes from the fact that Max's relationships with all of Double Exposure's characters--and even Caledon University a whole--feel distant."
"Whereas Arcadia Bay felt like a home and its residents, part of a community, walking through Caledon University reminded me of visiting a college campus during the holidays: quiet and almost liminal. Though I enjoyed some of the campus' faculty members, particularly the creative non-fiction professor Gwen, interactions with her felt largely stilted and her story did not go anywhere particularly interesting."
"The game's two romantic options, Amanda and Vinh, are forced and half-baked. While Amanda is a sweetheart, the quirky bartender ends up feeling more like someone who is merely around, as she doesn't have much of a role in the game and doesn't feel like someone Max is particularly drawn to. A lot of the time they spend together feels almost awkward, and some moments--such as Max suggesting she spend the night after a quick kiss--come off as bizarre given the majority of their interactions have involved Amanda being irritated at Max blowing her off, or her trying to give Max space to grieve. Vinh, on the other hand, plays a larger role in the narrative and does have his own vulnerabilities that are teased out through the game. But he is also essentially a frat bro who repeatedly hits on Max until you can choose to be endeared (or worn down) by him."
"And despite being told Safi and Moses are close friends, you don't see her exhibit a deep connection to either of them. There are certain things you'd think she'd know about her companions and plenty of things you'd think they'd know about her, even outside of her tragic past and powers. This is made more disappointing because Safi and Moses are two of the game's most interesting characters. Safi in particular has a lot of personality, a compelling backstory, and plenty of connections to the game's major players; she ultimately drives the game forward which, while not a problem in itself, makes for yet another side character who completely overshadows Max. And I understand that part of this is intent, I really do. But it is frustrating, in a narrative-heavy, emotional game, to feel like I am controlling a vehicle rather than a character."
"Another issue with Safi outshining Max is that, in many ways, it makes it entirely clear that Double Exposure is largely a retread of Life is Strange. It's a bit awkward, considering Deck Nine is developing the title rather than original studio Don't Nod. But even if I place that bit of distaste aside, it was strange as a player. I don't want to give away major plot points, but suffice to say that if I described in broad terms the plot to both games--relatively spoiler-free highlights being a school-based murder mystery, a looming storm, and an angsty female friend with issues and dead best friend shrouded in mystery--you'd be hard pressed to narrow down which Life is Strange I'm talking about."
"The relationship that felt the most tangible and real to me, strangely enough, was one that was barely seen throughout the game and has caused some outrage from the original game's fans: Max's relationship with Chloe. You won't see much of this play out if you state that Chloe died in the first game--and to be honest, you still won't see much even if you select that she survived. That said, there was something that felt so real about the pair having drifted off, their trauma bond over enduring such a life-altering series of events proving not quite enough to keep two people with such drastically different wants and personalities together."
"You see Chloe online on social media, even posting on occasion. She sends over the occasional text and checks in on you after seeing a troubling news report, proving that despite their differences, she will always care for Max. Whereas some found Chloe's lack of a place in Max's life somewhat insulting, I couldn't help but relate to that sort of bittersweet dynamic, having been in relationships like that before. Though she is not around, Chloe serves as a sort of shadow that hangs over Max, which is precisely what I'd expect."
"Double Exposure also deserves praise for its visuals and motion-capture, both of which are improved from previous Life is Strange titles. Better lighting and motion-capture technology that is able to replicate micro-expressions beautifully make for a heightened sense of realism, and allow the game to convey greater emotion than its stiff predecessors. However, the studio makes the smart call to not lean too far into that realism, ultimately favoring the series’ tendency towards more stylized characters and high-saturation environments. Though I might not have loved much of the story, I was drawn into Double Exposure’s world through its art."
"I also think--and I urge you to skip this paragraph if you wish to avoid larger spoilers!--that where Double Exposure leaves things and expands the wider Life is Strange universe makes for an exciting promise. In fact, it's so interesting--and pertinent to my overall feelings--that it feels important to bring up in spite of how hard I've tried to keep this all spoiler-free. In the same way that Remedy's Control made it clear that the events in Alan Wake, and Alan himself, are not these isolated forces, we see that sort of fun realization occur in this game as well. This also wonderfully harkens back to Life is Strange 2, which began to set up this premise. Though I wasn't thrilled to see ""Max Caulfield will return"" at the end of the game, the path that two other characters embark upon is compelling and makes me interested in a spin-off title following one or both of them. Suffice to say, I see the potential for a real Magneto-Xavier dynamic in the future, and I think that could be a fantastic place for the series to go."
"And yet, potential for a more interesting story doesn't quite improve the overall experience Life is Strange: Double Exposure. There’s a part of me that wonders if going into the game with a greater fondness for the original would have made the experience more enjoyable. There’s another part of me that wonders if the opposite is true, and I’d have been better coming in without ever having experienced the first game. But as both a continuation and a separate title, Double Exposure seems to fall short. Though it offers some interesting narrative beats, great visuals, and a few endearing characters, it fails to deliver the personality, drama, or emotion it is utterly reliant upon."
"Each new entry in the Dragon Age series is always transformative, so it's not uncommon for a fan to really love one of the entries but feel lukewarm about another. 2009's Origins played like a spiritual successor to 1998's Baldur's Gate, while its 2011 sequel took the series in a more third-person-action-game direction, and then 2014's Inquisition opted for gameplay that felt like a single-player MMO. If anything, the one constant to a Dragon Age game is that you can expect that each new game will be different from the last. At first, it looked like Dragon Age: The Veilguard was not going to surpass my enjoyment of past games, existing as no more than a safe return to form for developer BioWare instead of a bold step forward for the franchise. But inch by inch, The Veilguard has wormed its way into my Inquisition-loving heart. Is The Veilguard as complex and nuanced as past Dragon Age games? No, not at all. Instead, it delivers an action-packed romp through a fantastical setting with good friends."
"The Veilguard leans into real-time action-based combat, building on the formulas already established and iterated on in Mass Effect Andromeda and Anthem to push Dragon Age toward something more frenetic. Utilizing a system of setups and detonations to pull off explosive combos, The Veilguard encourages you to lean into strategically utilizing weapon attacks and magical abilities to pull off deadly dance-like patterns. It's tricky to find the rhythm at first but figuring out the pattern rewards you with an incredible sense of flow. Large skill trees and three specializations per class let you curate the experience to your satisfaction, and I never grew tired of pulling off clutch counters and delivering severe magical beatdowns despite The Veilguard's massive story length and large assortment of optional side missions, most of which see you fighting even more enemies."
"The mage is the one true outlier here. Early on, the class is easy enough to play, but as the story goes on, enemies get both more numerous and hardy. Your own attacks become grander and more explosive in response, leading to the screen filling with visual clutter. As a result, it can be frustratingly tricky to see the indicator for parries (which is already harder for the mage in comparison to the rogue and warrior), and oftentimes dulls the combat to a repetitive slog of flinging magical explosions, running away, locking back onto a target, and repeating--a step down from the far more satisfyingly strategic means by which the glass-cannon mage operated in past Dragon Age games."
"It certainly doesn't help that The Veilguard's lock-on mechanic is awful if you distance yourself too far away from enemies, which is where you want to be if you're playing mage. It regularly unlocks from foes whenever they escape your vision by leaping, burrowing, or teleporting toward you to close the distance you're creating--the exact moments when lock-on mechanics are most useful for a glass-cannon class. This means a great deal of your time in a fight as a mage is spent accidentally firing off an attack at nothing, trying to dodge an attack you can hear but can't necessarily see, or scanning the arena in search of your foe. This can lead to frustrating deaths, especially on higher difficulties or against bosses who summon minions to help them."
"Worse, it feels like BioWare has even acknowledged that the mage struggles in comparison to the other two classes, giving it an ability to ""switch"" styles from a spell-slinging staff to an arcane dagger for close quarters, and although the dagger does handle a lot better (especially if you opt for the aforementioned spellblade specialty), it's still clunky to aim and use."
"Most of The Veilguard's missions loop through the same formula of talking to an NPC, going somewhere, and fighting a lot of enemies. That can get repetitive when you're also dealing with the obtuse handling of the mage, but it remains consistently enjoyable with the more melee-oriented rogue and warrior that can easily lean into the parry and sword combos and experiment with how they're cutting through the different legions of enemies."
"Combat isn't the only way Rook engages with the world; it's just the tool they use most often. The conversational pillar of The Veilguard is a rewarding cat-and-mouse game of building alliances, exploring boundaries, unearthing trauma, and grasping at secrets. Exploring each locale gifts you wonderful visuals and captivating lore that draws you into the world--even if you opt for mage, there's still fun to be had. I haven't run into any major story missions that can be resolved without fighting--there doesn't seem to be anything like Inquisition's delightful Wicked Eyes and Wicked Hearts mission--but your choices carry narrative weight throughout. One choice early on has drastic consequences for two of Rook's allies as well as their homes (which can be Rook's home, too, depending on which faction they pick at character creation), determining which optional questlines they can pursue in the second act. The effects of that choice are felt for a long time, and even if not every decision carries the same level of importance, it reinforces the notion that any one choice can alter the immediate direction of the story and have unforeseen longer-term consequences. I love an RPG that gets me to put the controller down and pace back-and-forth for several minutes to mull over a choice, and The Veilguard delivers on that, even if not as regularly as past Dragon Age games."
"The story itself follows the titular Veilguard, which is led by your playable character, Rook, and tasked with stopping the machinations of the Dread Wolf--believed to be an ancient elven god of trickery, responsible for leading a rebellion and sealing away the other, more evil elven gods. Things don't go quite as planned during your first mission, leading to the once-sealed elven gods escaping their prison and seeking world domination, a threat more severe than the one the Dread Wolf posed. The story follows the typical structure of a BioWare RPG: recruit a team, befriend the team, fight some baddies, do some missions to increase your team's loyalty to you, get your smooches in, work step-by-step to reach the big bad. It's familiar but in a nostalgic and comforting way--it's a nice place to return to after what felt like an eternity away."
"The anthology nature of Dragon Age means there's a new hero at the helm at each of these games, and that hurts The Veilguard more than the others. Rook is boring and, even worse, feels out of place in the story told in The Veilguard. Previous Dragon Age games have made tremendous arguments for why the player character is the one burdened with the responsibility of stopping the evil of their respective games, with Inquisition's Inquisitor even leaning into the ""chosen one"" trope, wielding a power never-before-seen that made them uniquely qualified for the threat at hand. No such considerations are made for Rook beyond the initial leader of the Veilguard saying that it has to be Rook and they're the best one for the job, despite all evidence to the contrary. I've spent most of my time with the game wondering why I'm even playing as Rook, especially when so much of The Veilguard's story feels like a continuation of the Inquisitor's tale."
"Beyond feeling entirely out of place in comparison to the rest of the Veilguard, Rook feels somewhat aimless relative to their party companions, with not much in the way of an arc to pull the player in. Early into the adventure, there's a poignant moment where the Dread Wolf asks Rook why they feel they're ideal to lead the charge against the elven gods, and it feels telling that none of your available responses are especially good or convincing. Rook's situation becomes all the more perplexing as the game goes on and party members or important NPCs put tremendous stakes into Rook's opinions. It doesn't make much sense. Even if you argue Rook is a tool to make the game more approachable to newcomers to the franchise--as they carry no history you have to remember from a past game--it doesn't change the fact that The Veilguard's story doesn't seem to make a compelling argument for why this one person is important to Team Veilguard."
"Even if Rook's position in the story is suspect, the level of customization options available to build them is fantastic. The numerous options in the character creator do tend to favor the more humanoid humans, elves, and dwarves, but I'm impressed by how much control you have over your appearance, regardless of their ancestry or gender. Your choice of background, ancestry, class, and gender can inform how your Rook engages in roleplay by unlocking unique conversation options, too. This is the best character creator I've ever used in a single-player RPG, and I'm eager to see how the different choices you make for Rook at the start can inform key moments in the story in multiple playthroughs."
"The heroes who Rook aligns themselves with all present aspects of the culture or lore of Dragon Age that we've either never seen before or previously thought to be impossible. I found Harding's story deeply intriguing given the power she unlocks in the game's early hours, and uncovering the past about Bellara and Neve or learning more about the unique allies accompanying Davrin and Lucanis was a frequent narrative treat that left me eager to return to the Lighthouse hub between missions to talk (and flirt) with the colorful collection of heroes that evolved into somewhat of an oddball family. This isn't my favorite RPG party, but The Veilguard reminds you why BioWare is held as one of the undisputed kings of making party-focused RPGs. This is an incredible group of characters."
"Like past Dragon Age games, The Veilguard's story is primarily choice-driven, and the cast of NPCs squirm their way into your heart one conversational consequence at a time. Crucial decisions that influence the companions' fluctuating opinion of the protagonist don't seem to pop up in The Veilguard as much as in past games, as I found it too easy to game the system to keep everyone happy over the long haul, but the RPG answers this shortcoming by making the fluctuating nature of the party makeup more prominent than previously. Your decisions can see your favorite characters needing to take a break from the action (and Rook) regardless of their overall perception of the protagonist, and there are numerous missions that force you to take a specific team member along, restricting how you build your party. In this way, The Veilguard injects strategy and reactivity into its combat, as your perfect team might not be available to you depending on the choices you've made during roleplay. It's very cool."
"Thanks to The Veilguard's art direction, the environments look gorgeous. The game is filled with tantalizing visuals, ranging from artifact-filled forests of verdant greens and golden glows to canal-dominated cities of deep blues and evocative purples. This is an incredible-looking game, even during moments when it's trying to be scary. The music is tragically hit-or-miss, sometimes crescendoing to a level that manages to lend an important moment some much-needed gravitas but more often than not the music is drowned out by the combat or lacking enough emotional punch to be even noticed."
"All said, none of my complaints detract from the fact that The Veilguard is a mostly sound game that works when you're playing as a class that can take advantage of its combat. I haven't run into any glitches or game-breaking bugs. No side quest feels too obtrusive or too fetch quest-y. And now that I've distanced myself from the mage, each combat encounter is snappy and avoids feeling too tedious or frustrating. The Veilguard feels like BioWare making a good BioWare game again, and that in itself makes me extraordinarily happy."
"You really can't understate how historically important Dragon Quest III is. This is not just any JRPG--to players in Japan, it's the defining JRPG, a game that set sales records and truly made Dragon Quest an inextricable part of Japanese pop culture. To this day, it's recognized and referenced in all manner of media, and its wild success is the subject of both nostalgic fascination and urban legends."
"With such a pedigree behind it, it's no surprise that Square Enix has seen fit to re-release Dragon Quest III numerous times, with this HD-2D Remake edition being the latest--and also the most lavish--to date. Logic dictates that a game like this deserves a red-carpet treatment. But unlike Final Fantasy, which is no stranger to changing things up in its recent sequels and remakes, the old-fashioned elements of Dragon Quest's gameplay remain untouched no matter what."
"Of course, the biggest deal about this remake--which its very title proudly proclaims--is the use of Square Enix's HD-2D visual style. Previous HD-2D games like Octopath Traveler, Triangle Strategy, and the Live A Live remake have established a strong visual identity, using 2D sprites, 3D backgrounds, and scrolling and perspective tricks to create an ornate and cinematic style that makes them stand out."
"Dragon Quest III uses these visuals to bring its established locales to life. The cities and palaces are filled with details that mirror their real-world inspirations. Dungeons and caves are filled with musty corridors, scurrying critters, and shining torchlights. Shrines are covered with ornate decorations that hint at long-forgotten secrets. Despite all of this, however, the visuals do disappoint in some ways: Sprite animation is limited outside of the enemies you face in combat, the camera can glitch out in spots, and on the Switch version, some more graphically intense locations can make the game's framerate start to chug. Still, it'd be very difficult to argue that Dragon Quest III has ever looked better than this."
"The plot is largely unchanged from DQIII's original release: It's the sort of simple yarn that many early RPGs spun, complete with an evil overlord, a destined hero, and his/her scrappy, custom-built party. It's pretty by-the-numbers stuff, with most plot developments being glorified fetch quests that allow you to move on to the next key location. This remake does add some extra flair to the story, though, not only through lively, humorous localization but also new flashbacks showing the journey of the hero-character's father, the warrior Ortega. It's pretty cliched by modern standards, sure, but at least it's fun to read--and there's still the one big twist that was mindblowing when the game first released for first-time players to look forward to."
"While the various re-releases of Dragon Quest III have added lots of improvements and extras over the years--and this remake carries quite a few of those over--the core gameplay has largely remained the same too. You've still got all of the hallmarks of classic Dragon Quest: turn-based battles, rigid character classes that learn skills at set levels, careful item management, and hazardous treks over the world map between locations. (Thankfully, more convenient fast travel with Chimaera Wings and Zoom is one of the small quality-of-life improvements.)"
"So what are the major enhancements to gameplay? Perhaps the biggest is the addition of a new character class. Aside from your usual Warriors, Priests, Merchants, and Gadabouts (who are still intentionally terrible), you've got the new Monster Wrangler class that uses a variety of offensive, defensive, and support skills they've learned from monsters. They also supplement another big addition: finding and recruiting monsters to use in monster-battle arenas for money and prizes. Not only does the Monster Wrangler have a much easier time obtaining these critters; they also get strength and ability boosts based on how many they've managed to get to join."
"Another noteworthy addition is spots on the overworld map that contain items and hidden locations. Places of interest in the world of DQIII tend to be spread pretty far apart, so normally there's not a good reason to go meandering unless you want to grind for levels. The remake adds more incentive to get out and explore the world by spreading lots of little secrets and goodies all over the place. See some little sparkly spots on the map? If you go to inspect them, you're bound to find some items--usually consumables and old gear to pawn for cash, but sometimes you'll find some amazing weapons and armor that seem levels beyond what you should have. Conspicuously odd-looking spots on the overworld map might reveal an enclave with treasure chests, recruitable monsters, and maybe even a friendly NPC. Not only do these additions make walking through the overworld more enjoyable, but they also help you level up without grinding, since you're more naturally going to be hitting enemy encounters along the way."
"There are plenty of other welcome changes--quest markers making your next goal more obvious, auto-heals on leveling up, more unique abilities for otherwise straightforward classes like Warrior, and so on. These sorts of additions take a different approach from other remakes like the recent Romancing SaGa 2: They build on the foundation of Dragon Quest III rather than trying to change and modernize key gameplay elements. From the standpoint of keeping traditional Dragon Quest elements faithful, it does a good job, but there are downsides, particularly in combat. You won't be seeing some of the fun elements of later Dragon Quests, like the tension meter, in DQIII Remake. True to its 8-bit roots, it's about as basic as turn-based combat can get. And at points, that simplicity can make things drag. Unless you've got a particularly weird party composition (or you upped the difficulty), you can use AI autobattle settings for a good chunk of the early to mid game and mostly cruise along. Since class growth and skills are predetermined, there's not much to experiment with for characters, either--until roughly the halfway point, when you get the ability to change classes (augmenting your existing skills with those of a different class) and enemy attack patterns get significantly trickier."
"That's not to say that there's no customizability in character-building: besides the aforementioned class-changing and stat-boost seeds to munch on, there's a personality system that affects each character's stat growth. You can change personality types by reading books or equipping special accessories. This element has existed since the original release, and it's still a mess even now: A lot of the personality types actually slow overall stat growth, reducing many stat gains in favor of a small boost to one or two areas. You also can't easily see what a personality type actually affects without either wading through a bunch of menus to your info handbook or looking it up online, making it difficult to know at a glance if the personality fits the character you're trying to build. And a lot of the personality stat adjustments just don't make sense--why does a Narcissist get an agility boost while an Idealist's luck growth is really bad? I've never liked this system, and I think that this would have been a good opportunity to overhaul it, but alas."
"Dragon Quest III HD-2D isn't trying to fundamentally reinvent itself: It wants to present a genre-defining classic to the world in a great-looking modern package, to both inspire nostalgia in fans and show the world why this game is beloved. And it succeeds at that pretty well: It looks great, it's faithful to the original's gameplay (with some nice little quality-of-life enhancements), and the new additions add a bit of extra flavor. Its stubborn clinging to tradition means some flaws carry over, but when the overall package is this pretty, polished, and pleasant, it's hard to hold those against it for long."
"In Slay the Princess, however, death is only the beginning: the start of a time loop that nearly always resolves in mutually-assured destruction. But despite the horrors you endure and the promise of death--repeatedly and oftentimes brutally--the game begins with a small, strange note: This is a love story. And as a love story, a horrific visual novel, and a work of narrative-driven psychological fiction, Slay the Princess is remarkable. The Pristine Cut further polishes this gem of a game, adding more depth and replayability to an already-brilliant title that is abundant with introspection, poetic (and often humorous) writing, stellar voice acting, and memorable art and music. Though there are still a few rough spots--namely some of its audio mixing and its UX design on consoles--Slay the Princess is a beautiful experience, brimming with emotion and cleverness."
"The premise is simple enough and explained by both its name and its exposition: ""You're on a path in the woods, and at the end of that path, is a cabin. And in the basement of that cabin is a princess. You're here to slay her."" Naturally, this raises a lot of questions: Why does she need to die? Why am I the one killing her? What is the motive of the person instructing you to do this? As the protagonist's primary, guiding voice, it is up to you to explore the dozen or so prompts that emerge as each new piece of information is brought to light. Your every response and action--or lack thereof--determines and alters the path laid before the hero, as well as the many other voices that join you in guiding him as successive loops unfold."
"If you're the type to ask a lot of questions or second-guess yourself, The Paranoid or Skeptic might emerge, altering the choices you have and your own perception of what is happening. On the other hand, a self-assured approach might give way to the voice of The Stubborn or perhaps even The Smitten. As your personality, role, and beliefs are solidified, the form of the damsel tucked away in the basement is altered, as well. All of these factors compile and build across a handful of acts, culminating in the end of one story and the progression of a deeper narrative lurking just below the surface."
"This process of choosing new paths, watching abandoned ones crumble away, and stumbling into variants of the places, voices, and parties involved is fascinating. The breadth of the branching narrative is incredibly impressive, as you explore seemingly endless situations and events that range anywhere from surreal and horrific to heartbreaking and tender. I was also consistently impressed by how the game's responses seemed to perfectly predict my own, giving voice to nearly every ethically-motivated, practical, inquiring, or cheeky remark that resided in my own head. The Pristine Cut only adds to all these feats, giving players a slew of new scenarios and endings that add even more replayability and depth."
"Outside of this fascinating premise, however, much of what makes Slay the Princess so mesmerizing boils down to two things: stupendous writing and impressive performances by two voice actors with frankly incredible capabilities and range."
"Lead writer Tony Howard-Arias and Abby Howard, the game's lead artist and assistant writer, work together to create a work that is vivid, poetic, clever, introspective, and, perhaps most shockingly, funny. The voices in your head are great at adding levity to dark situations (The Cheated, in particular, brings an annoyed angst that is always good for a laugh), while multiple other scenarios lead to absurd and funny resolutions that are further elevated by the game's art, which dramatically changes based on the writing's overall tone."
"But in the moments where tenderness is placed front and center, or moments of deep introspection, Howard-Arias proves himself extremely capable of moving the reader and finding ways to turn a surreal experience into something relatable and reflective. It's difficult to broach some of these moments, as they are best left for players to discover, and I've already revealed arguably more than I'd want any new player to know about the game, but there are a lot of parts of the game--especially in its larger narrative--that moved me."
"Another duo that brings a lot to the game are voice actors Jonathan Sims and Nichole Goodnight, who--while only voicing a total of three independent characters--create upwards of a dozen different voices for them. Regardless of if Sims is voicing the more straight-laced yet exasperated Narrator, or any of the hero's several personas, he delivers a consistently fantastic performance. He is able to perfectly capture the emotion behind the fast-talking, curse-slinging The Cheated, the Robert Smith-esque The Cold, and the boisterous, lovestruck The Smitten, making it feel as if a whole ensemble has come together to guide the hero. Similarly, Goodnight is able to bring terror, devotion, pain, ferociousness, disgust, animosity, and utter detachment to The Princess, creating a damsel you can't help but develop complicated feelings for."
"I would also be remiss to not bring up the game's Foley effects, as well. Slay the Princess wouldn't work nearly as well without the gut-wrenching sounds of ripping flesh, the cracking of bones, the rattle of draped chains and butcher's hooks, and much, much more."
"The game's music--and the strategic use of cutting it to intensify a few, select scenarios--also serve to create atmosphere and environment; I'm not exaggerating when I say that each track is fantastic. The delicate piano of ""The Princess"" is haunting yet heartfelt and serves as a repeated motif throughout the game, such as in one of The Pristine Cut's new tracks, ""Rhythm of the Flesh,"" which leans hard into an intense horror sound. ""The Apotheosis"" is another standout track, with its operatic backing vocals and an almost industrial sound. ""A Kiss From a Thorn"" tugs at the heartstrings, causing emotions to swell as The Narrator reluctantly describes the ensuing scenario: ""If history itself were not about to end, historians would document this moment for the rest of time. Musicians would write era-defining ballads, and great artists would expend entire lifetimes trying to merely capture the spark you hold right now.”"
"The game's art is another impressive feat, as it is all gorgeous, ever-shifting, and entirely hand-drawn. It’s almost unfinished, frenetic quality, and the fact that it is entirely in greyscale, works extremely well within the context of the game, as it reflects and amplifies The Hero's overall psyche and allows for Howard to do some create more experimental works that might not translate as well if converted into traditional graphics."
"But while this decision works, there are a few others that feel a bit reflective of limited resources that could use some slight improvements. Though Goodnight does a fantastic job voicing The Princess, at times the audio mixing felt a bit off, with her more booming lines sounding a bit blown out while others feel almost layered atop the rest of the game rather than mixed in. Additionally, the UX could use a bit of work on console. When I first played Slay the Princess on PC, I had zero qualms with the user interface. However, in playing The Pristine Cut on PS5, I realized the experience doesn't translate quite as well. It was a bit hard to keep track of what I was currently hovering over and wading through the game's countless dialogue options was overwhelming at times."
"My first inclination is to figure out who everyone is, from the inmates lined up outside to the prison guards inspecting the now-empty cells. Some first names are uttered in dialogue or scribbled on the side of the cell block in graffiti. Surnames can be found in formal letters and employee logs. Now it's a matter of putting names to faces, repeating conversations I've already had or looking through my notes to see who's talking to or about who, perusing an obscured note in the boss's office, and rummaging through all of the inmate's belongings. Once I know who everyone is and in which cell each prisoner resides, I just have to figure out how one of them masterminded a daring escape."
"Much like its predecessor, The Rise of the Golden Idol presents you with what is essentially a diorama of a moment in time--typically taken at the precise second, or in the immediate aftermath, of a crime. It's up to you to deduce what exactly happened by pointing and clicking through all of the available evidence to figure out--among other things--who was involved, which items are incriminating, and what the exact sequence of events was. Whereas 2022's The Case of the Golden Idol revolved around a slew of murders related to the eponymous Idol, the kill count in this sequel is decidedly lower. There are still more than a few dead bodies amongst its 20 cases, but you're also tasked with unraveling the events behind prison escapes, experimental lab tests, and the backstage chaos of a talent show gone awry."
"Rise of the Golden Idol picks up 200 years after the events of the first game, as the grisly history of the Golden Idol follows the artifact from the 18th century to the semi-modern setting of the 1970s. Once again, you're cast as an observer of these strange cases; an omnipresent force given license to freely explore each tableau at your own pace, burrowing into people's pockets, opening any door, and using logic to piece together the lurid events of its interconnected story."
"Similarly to the first game--and contemporaries such as The Return of the Obra Dinn and Shadows of Doubt--The Rise of the Golden Idol doesn't hold your hand. It quickly teaches you to think for yourself as you embark on solving its many mysteries across five distinct chapters. There's a built-in hint system, but it's not designed to simply tell you the solution. Instead, it's a tool to push you in the right direction, letting you decide if you want it to ask you a leading question, provide further guidance, or give you a direct hint. Outside of this, you're on your own. There's an element of trial and error involved at times, and it's possible to brute force your way to some solutions, but for the most part, only deductive reasoning will lead to the right answers."
"There's still nothing else quite like The Case of the Golden Idol's unique style of crime-solving, yet that doesn't mean The Rise of the Golden Idol rests on the laurels established by its predecessor, either. The interface has been reworked to make the puzzle-solving much more streamlined. Keywords--like names, items, locations, and verbs--are now automatically added to your veritable phrasebook, saving you from having to click on each one individually. The only downside is that, with so many recurring characters, it feels redundant having to re-discover everyone's names again when they appear in new cases, even if the process is simpler."
"Another UI improvement means you no longer need to constantly switch between exploring a scene and using the old ""thinking"" mode, in which you would transition to a different screen to drag and drop words into blank spaces in order to solve each crime. You still need to complete these fill-in-the-blank statements--""blank and blank discovered the body of blank,"" for example--and ascertain other information, such as who won what item at an auction or which noise agitated which exotic bird. But now these statements appear as moveable pop-out windows, letting you observe the scene and surmise everything that happened simultaneously. It's a much more intuitive way to piece everything together and makes the process of cross-referencing details a lot easier. There's even a quality-of-life toggle to minimize every window when the screen gets too cluttered."
"The Rise of the Golden Idol's drastic shift in setting makes for a notable difference in the sorts of crimes you'll be investigating, too. Not to mention some of the methods used to solve them. In one case, you need to match fingerprints to the people they belong to and then use this information to determine which characters touched a specific piece of equipment. Later on, a different case sees you investigating a dead body in a zoo, while another involves drugs on the set of a beachside photo shoot."
"The sorts of characters you'll meet are also differentiated. While the first game dealt with aristocrats, a clandestine cult, and other period-appropriate figures, Rise of the Golden Idol features corporate profiteers, middle managers, and an altogether different kind of cult selling itself on achieving enlightenment. I won't spoil the story with too many details, but one of the key themes focuses on the folly of human hubris--something that's all too relatable today. All of this goes a long way toward making each vignette feel fresh and unlike anything found in the previous game."
"There are a few cases that just didn't click with me, however, mainly due to the absence of murder--or any sort of criminal wrongdoing, really. These scenarios usually provide a tidbit of narrative to keep things moving but are otherwise unremarkable because the stakes are so low. The ""Aha!"" moment that occurs when you crack a case isn't nearly as satisfying when you've simply figured out the path a block of ice took rolling down a hill as opposed to figuring out who killed another human being. I appreciate the added levity these cases typically provide, but they would feel like filler if not for the pertinent information each one tends to add to the overall story."
"Fortunately, the underwhelming cases are firmly in the minority. The menagerie of engaging scenarios quickly grows more complex as additional characters are introduced--usually with nebulous motives--and unrelated clues are mixed in to throw you off the scent. By virtue of being a sequel, The Rise of the Golden Idol was never going to feel as surprising as its predecessor, but it builds on those foundations with even more intricate puzzles, forcing you to think outside the box. Whether you're using images and colors to decipher a coded message or rewatching a video over and over again to figure out the secret meaning hidden within a dancer's movements, no two cases are the same."
"The environments themselves also contain crucial details that aren't necessarily marked as clues, yet are imperative to find if you want to piece the entire jigsaw together. For instance, a band-aid on someone's finger might reveal who took a photograph, while the color of a model's lipstick could point to their identity. Each case may initially seem disparate, too, but like the red threads on a detective's corkboard, connections eventually begin to reveal themselves as you uncover the overarching narrative unifying them all."
"This brings us to another new feature that crops up at the end of each chapter. Here, you're tasked with completing a new statement that summarizes everything that happened in the underlying story during the most recent batch of cases. With such a tangled web of mysteries, it would be easy to feel lost or overlook important details without this--as was the case in the first game. But this prevents that from happening by tasking you with fully analyzing everything that just happened, making the story much more cohesive and easy to follow."
"A few underwhelming cases do little to dampen The Rise of the Golden Idol's unmistakable quality. This is a worthy successor to one of 2022's best games, putting a fresh spin on its singular concept with another collection of challenging and inventive puzzles. With a compelling story tying it all together and smart changes to its interface, Rise of the Golden Idol is everything you could ask for from a sequel; it's an excellent continuation of a singular idea, and there's already more on the way. Armchair sleuths are eating well."
"After 20 years of tie-in games made mainly in one specific shape, players have been conditioned to know what to expect when they see the word Lego at the front of a game's title. Lego Horizon Adventures, however, diverges from some of what that naming convention may conjure in one's mind. It's not a stark departure from the dozens of games that precede it, but Lego Horizon Adventures alters the formula in a few noticeable ways. In the process, it cleverly reinvents its universe for a new base of players, though it struggles to build on its own revised formula consistently."
"Despite using a zoomed-out third-person perspective familiar to Lego game players, Lego Horizon Adventures is a far more cinematic Lego game. This might not come as much of a surprise, however, considering how PlayStation has defined its brand by chasing Hollywood for the past 15 years. Gone are several Lego-game tropes, such as unlocking dozens of characters, or replaying levels with those characters to solve previously unapproachable puzzles. In fact, you'll hardly solve puzzles at all, save for a few very light platforming puzzles. Though you'll collect Lego studs to spend on rewards in-game, you won't be chasing collectibles like mini-kits or hidden items. Lego Horizon Adventures is instead a linear action-adventure game."
"That has both advantages and disadvantages. On the brighter side, the game looks incredible. Lego Horizon ditches the series' typical style of brickifying only the playable area and giving the rest of the landscape, like backgrounds and foregrounds, a more lifelike look. In this game, everything is Lego bricks. It's somewhat subtle, but once I noticed that change, it partly helped explain how pretty it all is. By presenting a singular style, it feels like a real Lego set come to life in a way other games of this sort have never offered."
"That design tweak, combined with similarly remarkable lighting to that which made Horizon Forbidden West such a visually striking PS5 title, makes this the best-looking standalone Lego game ever made. It's on par with Epic's Lego Fortnite in terms of dazzling visuals, which makes sense considering they're both made in Unreal Engine 5. Colors spill out of the screen in every frame and provide an intended youthful spirit reminiscent of PlayStation's other kid-friendly games like Astro Bot, Ratchet and Clank, and Sackboy: A Big Adventure."
"Rather than retell the Horizon story in brick form, Lego Horizon acts like a reimagined version of that saga, remixing the story beats of Horizon: Zero Dawn specifically and presenting it in a kid-friendlier package that plays out like a Pixar or Dreamworks movie. The story isn't so adult to begin with, but here, it localizes the drama a bit more. Whereas Zero Dawn is about climate change and corporate meddling on a global scale, Lego Aloy and her pals are now concerned more with their village, and some of the themes are made more approachable for kids."
"Much of the original game's cast reprise their roles in Lego Horizon Adventures, adding a sense of continuity while also altering them in ways that are rewarding for players and seem like fun for their respective actors. The series' main faces are all here, turned into amusing caricatures, and four of them are playable before long, with all of them dishing out frequent jokes. Aloy expresses a can-do spirit that is lighter in tone than how she comes across in her typical adventures. She's always a go-getter, but here, the stakes are purposely lowered to be less stressful or all-consuming while keeping the story adventurous and exciting for the game's younger players."
"Other characters are similarly remixed for laughs. Erend, Aloy's close ally, becomes a rather lumbering oaf eager to help his friends, but more driven to uncover a mythical Donut Hoard, for example. Rost acts as both a character and narrator, and the game usually leans on him when it's breaking the fourth wall, as it often does, to crack jokes about video game tropes, such as why each level's end reward of a gold brick is needed in the first place."
"If the mainline Horizon games are light RPGs, Lego Horizon is Baby's First RPG. Each character has a lengthy skill tree, but these skills are unlocked automatically as you level up, and in an order you can't influence. Characters do level separately, meaning you can go all in on a main character or spread your time across multiple heroes, though depending on which of the game's several welcome difficulties you're on, only the former strategy is viable--even for a kids game, you'll want to gain at least several of the health buffs in a hero's predefined skill tree."
"Lego Horizon Adventures uses the traditional drop-in/drop-out co-op system of other Lego games. It even improves it in one long overdue way: online co-op, which the typical Lego games have lacked for so long, is available. Once the game's foursome of playable heroes is unlocked, each player can be whomever they'd like, so long as they aren't duplicates of their co-op buddy. Further promoting the lightest of RPG elements, characters play slightly differently, too. Naturally, Aloy fires arrows, while Erend smashes enemies with a hefty warhammer, for example. With this, a pair of players can cement strengths and hide weaknesses, teaching players to work as a team."
"Throughout each level, you'll find special weapons with finite uses, giving you the advantage over the hulking machines and cultists you'll face. These weapons are consistently fun and do very well to give you a combat advantage. The Hot Dog Cart becomes a stationary mortar, lobbing explosive franks at enemies scattered across a combat area, while character-specific weapons, such as a fire bow for Aloy, call back to the mainline games and prove incredibly useful in this game, too. My favorite is a Lego brick remover, seen elsewhere as the orange tool you sometimes receive inside newly opened Lego sets. In the game, it works as a cartoonishly effective mallet, removing even the biggest enemies' health bars by a large portion."
"Lego Horizon also carries over Zero Dawn's introduction of focus-based combat, in which you scan enemy machines for weak points, and then strike those areas for critical hits. You won't be scrapping these animal-shaped machines for crafting parts, but in a simple manner of holding and aiming your attack button, you'll highlight these weak spots in a way that comfortably translates the typical mechanics of the series. It's a nice touch, and an on-screen arrow will aid younger players so they can handle it well and in short order."
"Exploring the game's 20+ levels, it's clear similar considerations have been made elsewhere. Approaching a zipline will automatically send you sliding down it, and climbing the (yellow, of course) handholds on rock walls requires only pointing the left stick toward where you want to go next. These make levels easier to move through by demanding fewer button presses and less sizing up of a 3D space. Though some traditional platforming involving misdirected or mistimed jumps can still occur, it's usually the case that the game's camera and presentation work with you, not against you. I beat the game with my five-year-old daughter--admittedly, she's been playing games for a while already, but here, she often led me through missions because they flow so naturally that she rarely needed my help outside of combat."
"However, it's also the flow of these levels that chiefly illustrates the game's shortcomings, particularly how it ditched some traditional Lego elements that would have made missions feel more replayable and interesting. Each of the game's levels unfolds on one of four biomes, but while they look wonderful, they largely all feel the same. You'll move from light smash-'em-up sections where you're collecting studs--far fewer than usual Lego games, mind you, given how much of the world isn't destructible--and combat zones that block you from advancing until all enemies have been defeated. Most levels end with you rescuing kidnapped villagers or destroying the polluting machinery belonging to the game's Big Bad, and both of these outcomes are merely cutscenes after a chaotic battle sequence. As a result, it quickly becomes difficult to tell any two levels apart beyond what colors the environment may be."
"Combat evolves well thanks to characters earning new skills, finding new super weapons, and the game's always-evolving list of enemies. But the act of moving from A to B feels the same each time, and there aren't nearly enough disruptions to this format. In the place of other Lego games' plethora of characters with unique puzzle-solving abilities, Lego Horizon invites replayability only in the form of boss hunts--extra-hard machines that weren't present earlier in the campaign--and a game-long side project to beautify Mother's Heart, the village that acts as a hub world between levels."
"Completing challenges and beating levels unlocks gold bricks, which open up new areas of Mother's Heart to customize. The game's long list of customization options includes styles faithful to Horizon's world, like a feasting table for NPCs to gather at and eat together, as well as many silly options too, like a roller coaster, popcorn stand, and, of course, a donut shop for the village's most pastry-obsessed warrior. The game even pulls in collections from other Lego brands like Lego City and Ninjago, allowing you to create distinct zones within the hub, or mix and match to your heart's desire."
"This aspect of the game is, in itself, a wonderful and child-like touch that promotes creativity and ownership of a play space, like hanging posters in a bedroom or displaying toys on a shelf. Many attractions, such as an obstacle course and different thrill rides, are even interactive, if only by way of a one-off animation you perform at each of them. But the hub world's customization being tied to challenges that will largely happen post-campaign means it's less fun, as the game then devolves into a checklist of things to do not unlike the mainline series does at times, too."
"As an onboarding to the RPG genre, young players may grapple with aspects of games that will be novel to them, like skill trees, character builds, and endgame bosses, but a checklist of things to do almost feels cynical, as though it's ingraining in its inexperienced players' minds the idea that such busy work is foundational to the genre or medium. It doesn't have to be, and even previous Lego games, as formulaic as they certainly are in their own ways, diversify enough from IP to IP by building their puzzles around the specific worlds and characters they portray."
"Still, that only makes Lego Horizon Adventures a flawed game, not a bad one. Its story reshapes an adult plot for a younger audience seamlessly, with a strong sense of humor that kids will adore. Like a lot of content aimed at families, my strongest sense of joy is found not in how I experience Lego Horizon but in watching my kids become immersed in it. Levels often feel repetitive, but combat is exciting and tactical enough to teach depth and ask players to consider their approach, even as Aloy may be dressed up like a corn cob, a firefighter, or a pug. It's that blend of child-like style and mechanical substance that makes Lego Horizon Adventures a lovely game to play for parent and child pairings, though it's also just neat to see these usually self-serious characters put through a washing machine loaded with crayons."
"There's always been something endearing about Metal Slug. While its contemporaries like Contra ratcheted up the aliens and body horror, Metal Slug instead leaned hard into comedy, mixing its signature run-and-gun action with comically overbuilt machines, cartoonish villains, and a silly cast of action-hero cliches."
"While there have been a few spin-offs over the years, Metal Slug Tactics is the series' first foray into turn-based strategy, and it comes with a roguelike twist. It's a mostly successful mission thanks to clever gameplay and maintaining the silly charm the series is known for, though some outdated tropes and too much of your success being outside of your tactical control keep this operation from being a total victory."
"Tactics moves the long-running sidescroller onto an isometric grid, and the pixel art-inspired models do a great job capturing the look and feel the series is known for. Everything from the iconic POWs to the titular Metal Slug tanks themselves feel exactly like the original series translated to 3D. The isometric battlegrounds are littered with varied terrain, buildings, foliage, and other scenic elements that feel right at home, and bosses are exactly the kind of over-engineered machinery you would expect."
"An individual mission drops your squad of three soldiers onto a small battlefield, as you take turns moving, attacking, and unleashing special abilities. An added wrinkle is the ability to perform sync attacks. If one member of your team hits an enemy, and another teammate has them lined up and in range, they will also execute an attack. A single shot typically isn't enough to take someone down, so learning how to set these up makes a big difference. It's also supremely satisfying when you set up a cascade of sync attacks for each character in a round, wiping enemies off the board or doing massive damage to one of the enormous end-of-region bosses."
"Your heroes aren't as disposable as the soldiers and vehicles in Advance Wars, nor is it as disastrous if one falls in battle like classic Fire Emblem. Downed units can be brought back mid-mission using a limited supply of revives. Alternatively, everyone is raised with full health at the end of a level, which makes calculating the risk/reward of trying to finish your objectives while understaffed exciting."
"The main cast of characters is a lot of fun. You start with three of nine potential heroes available, including long-time Sluggers Marco and Eri. More characters typically unlock as you complete runs, and it is great how Tactics even brings in characters like Clark and Rolf from sister series Ikari Warriors. Each hero has a unique mix of weapons, abilities, and passive bonuses, and that makes experimenting with different team compositions exciting. Marco's pistol may not do as much damage as Rolf's knife, for example, but sometimes hitting distant targets from behind cover is the better play."
"Abilities are tied to adrenaline, which primarily builds up based on how many spaces you move in a given turn. This also increases your defense, allowing you to avoid incoming damage. These combine to incentivize playing aggressively rather than slowly scooting forward one tile at a time. At first, the abilities are fairly modest, like Fio moving a single unit a small number of spaces. As you move through a run, however, you frequently gain access to additional abilities as post-level rewards. Taking a few extra steps in a turn becomes much more enticing when you get to call in a powerful, area-clearing air strike at the end of it."
"Every level has one primary and one secondary objective. You must complete the former to advance, while the latter, often consisting of challenges like winning in a certain number of turns or avoiding taking damage, bestows an additional reward. If you fail to complete the main task or your entire team is wiped out, your run ends in failure, and you are sent back to base camp to regroup and start again. It's a tried-and-true formula that generally works well here, although not all of the missions are created equally. Taking out four specific targets within a limited number of turns is fun. Escorting a slow-moving NPC to an exit on the other side of the battlefield, however, is not."
"When you visit a region, you are taken to a Mario World-style overworld map connecting levels with paths. You can see which rewards are available at each, though only three of the levels will be immediately accessible. If you have your eyes on a specific prize, such as the Strategic Assets that let you call in ultra-powerful single-use consumables like Metal Slugs, you may need to form a deliberate path, which encourages an engaging bit of thoughtfulness before you dive into the action."
"Completing three levels summons the region's boss, and these fights are by far the most interesting and intense challenges in Tactics. Each combines a massive health pool with unique mechanics and endless waves of cannon fodder to keep the pressure on. Nothing in standard missions quite prepares you to duck for cover to avoid level-wide blasts from a giant robot snake, or to jump from barge to barge as you battle a massive warship. They strike just the right tone of tough but exciting and are great palette cleanser between standard missions."
"Missions are challenging enough that clearing every level for the first time feels like an achievement. Similar to other roguelikes, the first full clear (which took me around 10 hours), isn't the end. Rather, it starts a new phase that focuses more on what you do in an individual run, nicely layering in an additional element of strategy as you master the basics, with additional optional bosses mixed in."
"It would be nice if the regions themselves were more varied. Technically, there are four areas, though two are deserts. Each has unique enemies and quirks that distinguish them, like sewers in the Urban area that let you quickly get around, but given that you will be looping through the levels many times, it does start to get a bit stale after a few cycles."
"Each area mixes in a unique assortment of enemies with different attacks and behaviors, which does a good job making each feel distinct. However, it seems well past time to retire some of the recurring racial tropes. It's really not necessary to put an enemy in a turban and have them swing a saber if you are in a desert, or give out spears and masks, and call the people you fight in the jungle ""Natives,"" even if they did show up in prior Metal Slug entries."
"There's a lot of randomization in each run, enough that it often feels like the odds of success are determined more by luck than any tactical decisions. You get to select which region to make your incursion into but from there the levels, objectives, and rewards reshuffle on every attempt. If luck is on your side, you will have powerful upgrades and abilities readily available in easy levels. If fate is against you, however, tasks can feel impossible. It's frustrating when a promising run ends early because you need to take out a heavily armored truck before it escapes, and you don't have the firepower to pull it off. It feels particularly terrible to enter a boss fight knowing, based on the equipment you have, that you are almost certainly doomed."
"This would be less of an issue if the incremental upgrades you could earn were more meaningful. Metal Slug Tactics focuses on earning cash to add more loadouts and abilities. The loadouts determine your starting weapons and abilities, adding more but, not necessarily better, options. Buying abilities directly adds them to the potential post-level upgrade pool, which means taking advantage of those once again comes down largely to luck, and there are only a few abilities to add per character, so after a few rounds, it is hard to feel like anything you do makes a difference. That’s a tough pill to swallow when other roguelikes such as Hades make every run, successful or not, count by giving you progress towards persistent weapon upgrades."
"Metal Slug Tactics does an excellent job of capturing the look and feel of Metal Slug and reimagining it as a turn-based strategy roguelite. The way its strategic elements combine adrenaline-fueled abilities and sync attacks makes for exciting combat that feels smart. It's too bad that a successful run is so reliant on luck, whether it's a favorable mix of missions or the right rewards and upgrades dropping. That, and the uncomfortably outdated enemy designs, are unforced errors that limit the advance of this otherwise capable army."
"The Mario & Luigi RPG series started on the Game Boy Advance, and even many years and a few iterations later, it has always reflected a connection to those roots. The two-button Game Boy Advance was the impetus for the series' central hook: Each brother is assigned to a face button and you control them both at once. Even as the series has progressed to platforms with more face buttons, the core concept has remained defined by its initial limitations. Now brought to the Switch, Mario & Luigi: Brothership feels like a conscious effort to escape those limitations, resulting in a lengthy RPG that can't quite sustain its own weight."
"In Brothership, several denizens of the Mushroom Kingdom are magically swept into the new setting of Concordia--a vast sea dotted with islands that used to be part of one contiguous land mass. A world tree of sorts, the Uni-Tree served as the tether that held all of the islands together, but it suddenly wilted and the islands drifted apart. With the help of a young researcher, you pilot a ship that houses a new Uni-Tree sapling, connecting islands and the Great Lighthouses that amplify its power to bring them all back together. So your ship comes to resemble a tugboat, with several islands tethered and pulled behind it."
"It's a concept that allows for lots of different kinds of environments and stories on self-contained little islands. One might be modeled like a desert, while another is a multi-story corporate headquarters. The Great Lighthouses serve as major dungeons, so each of the acts consists of the smaller stories on each island, the larger story arc of the region, and then the Great Lighthouse dungeon as its resolution."
"Mario and Luigi are wandering do-gooders who just chip in because they're in a position to help. And while they don't have spoken dialogue, you get a lot of characterization out of the stellar animation quality. Brothership is an impressive feat of art direction, showcasing both new and familiar characters with a simple but very effective style that has a cartoon-like elasticity. I never got tired of seeing Luigi's face light up, or the various arrival animations as they landed on different islands. There's a running gag that Mario always lands perfectly and Luigi always lands somewhat less perfectly, with lots of funny variations on just how many ways it can go wrong."
"If the islands are nicely differentiated, though, exploring them is unremarkable. Mario & Luigi has never been known for its platforming prowess, and you would never mistake Brothership for a proper Mario platformer. The controls are just a little too rigid, and sometimes that makes platforming puzzles feel less organic than they should. It also oddly abandons the dual-hero gimmick of Mario & Luigi by putting Mario squarely in the driver's seat. Luigi is less an equal than a sidekick who follows along (mostly) dutifully, and you can sometimes tap the L button to send him off to gather resources so you don't have to, or to have him help solve puzzles. That does alleviate some frustration I had with previous Mario & Luigi games, in which I had to get the timing for both brothers perfect while crossing a gap, for example, but it's strange to have Luigi so clearly play a supporting role. This functionally compromises its identity--less Mario & Luigi and more Mario featuring special guest Luigi."
"In combat, though, Luigi is more than an equal. Both brothers do their own animated versions of timing-based attacks, but for most boss fights, Luigi can summon a moment of ""Luigi Logic"" to do a special stage-based stunner that will leave the boss vulnerable. I got the sense this was to give the character something to do and act as a counterweight to him mostly being a second banana in the exploration segments. The timing attacks work just as well as ever here, and you select Jump or Hammer based on the enemy's attributes for a light rock-paper-scissors element. Counterattacks are back as well, and they can sometimes even just end a battle immediately as you deal heavy damage back to the opponent. That said, with only two party members, it can be very easy to get into a doom-loop of using revival items on each brother in turn, once you reach tougher enemies and you're first learning their attack patterns."
"Combat does have a couple of new wrinkles that help add more depth, the first of which is a regular pace of permanent upgrades. Every eight levels, you get to pick one upgrade to last you the rest of the game, like getting extra EXP from every battle or earning extra power stats with every subsequent level-up. Those are uniform between Mario and Luigi, but the two brothers do have their own specialties with stats that level up faster--Luigi is especially good at Defense and the Luck-like Stash stat, for example."
"The second major combat element is Plugs: major game-changing power-ups that can be equipped across a power-strip-like interface as you unlock more outlets. These can have attributes like creating a blast radius when you get an Excellent rating on a timed attack, giving you items back after use, or being especially resistant to certain status effects. The plugs have a limited number of charges, after which they go into a recharge state, but other plugs can impact the recharge timing too. All in all, I was reminded most of Materia from Final Fantasy 7, in which nodes could be set to enable powers and the real joy was in tinkering with powerful combinations. Plugs are even more versatile, in fact, because you can hot-swap them mid-battle without losing a turn."
"However, Plugs also raise the specter of Mario & Luigi: Brothership's major weakness: its pacing. The Mario & Luigi games are full-fledged RPGs, but they're compact, usually topping out at around 25 hours. Brothership seemed intent on hitting a lengthier playtime, and it just can't sustain itself for that long. The Plugs element doesn't even get introduced until almost 10 hours into the experience, and by then, combat was starting to feel rote. I appreciated that it injected a new element, but I would have liked to have it before combat was getting stale, not after."
"The pacing problems are only exacerbated as the game progresses. Late in the game, there's a required story quest that then leads to a decision that could make the quest itself totally irrelevant. At more than one point, you're required to revisit a bunch of islands you've already visited. There are two almost-identical boss fights that occur nearly back to back. Traveling by sea can be tedious, even with a faster-sailing option, and small Islets have no fast-travel option and must be sailed to manually. Plus, when a particular plot element gets introduced, the writing gets significantly funnier with several laugh-out-loud gags and dialogue, but it took me about 30 hours to get there. All this makes it feel like the game isn't really respecting your time. And worse, the performance suffers with drops in the frame rate, especially near the end, leaving it to finish on a sour note."
"All of this feels especially frustrating because, at its core, Brothership tells a sweet if simple fable about togetherness and human connection. The islands were ripped apart and isolated, and the ultimate threat at play is a sort of pandemic of loneliness. There's even a surprising light visual motif around screen addiction and how it may keep people from forming interpersonal bonds. It's a nice story, but it's not one that needs to be 50 hours long."
"That length may have been born from a desire to create a big, meaty RPG, but in the end, it mostly serves to accentuate the simplicity in all aspects. Stretched over so many hours, exploration becomes dull, combat feels repetitive, and the story can't sustain itself. Mario & Luigi: Brothership is well made and has some great ideas, but in breaking free of its handheld limitations, it becomes too ambitious for its own good."
"Third-person action game Slitterhead often presents a pretty compelling front. At first, it sounds like an out-there horror game with an inventive approach to gameplay. You play as a formless spirit that can possess humans, hunting vicious monsters capable of imitating normal people. Those creatures explode from the heads of their human bodies to reveal their true forms when discovered."
"As cool as all those words clearly are, Slitterhead never reaches the promise of its premise, apart from a few gorgeous cutscenes where a human twists and mutates into a disgusting, multi-armed abomination. Instead, it's usually frustrating and repetitive, with its interesting ideas turning to gimmicks that wear themselves thin after the first few hours."
"Those gimmicks feel like they have potential, at least at first. Slitterhead opens with you taking on the role of the Hyoki: a floating spirit that can zip into the brains of random humans populating the dense city of Kowlong, briefly taking control of their bodies. The Hyoki can't remember anything about itself or what it's doing, until it encounters its first slitterhead--which, after eating the brains of an unsuspecting victim, bursts from the skull of its host and chases you down alleys as you zap from one hapless soul to another to stay just ahead of it. The concept is weird, changing the way you think about characterization and physical gameplay space, and slitterheads are scary--it's a great way to start the game."
"But this is the only time you're on the back foot or that Slitterhead makes use of the horror aspects of its premise. For the duration, you're hunting the parasites with the motive of exterminating them, and it's the monsters that run from you. As you leap into humans, you can use their blood to briefly create solid weapons like clubs and spears, allowing you to go toe-to-toe with the giant octopuses and praying mantises that erupt out of the necks of their unfortunate hosts. Humans are physically weaker than slitterheads, but each new body you take over gives you a new health bar to run down, as well as the element of surprise to go after a creature while it's slashing up the poor meatbag you just abandoned. As a combat system, the idea of making use of a crowd to constantly confuse and overpower your enemy with an endless series of ambushes is a fun one."
""
"Slitterhead adds to the idea when you start finding Rarities--humans who form closer bonds with the Hyoki to make their possession a little more of a partnership, and who sport special abilities as a result. Those abilities tend to reflect each of their personalities and vocations. You might heal nearby allies or summon more humans to a battle, power up your melee weapons to set enemies on fire, throw exploding weapons, or even turn humans you possess into kamikaze time bombs. And all humans can dodge away from attacks and block or parry some blows, which can give you opportunities for big counterattacks--deflect enough strikes and you'll trigger a brief period of slowed time in which you can wail on an opponent with everything you've got."
"The components of Slitterhead's combat ought to come together to make for something unexpected and entertaining, but fights are rarely all that engaging in practice. While there are a few different kinds of Slitterheads and they sometimes bring different attacks to bear against you, for the most part, they all fight the same way. Even still, I never quite felt like I could get the hang of the parry system thanks to the speed and angles at which attacks come at you. The system lacks the feeling of being tight and reliable, and I was frequently oscillating between being able to perfectly parry one slitterhead to make a fight completely trivial, only for the next one to body me over and over."
"Standing your ground is a worse way to fight, though, when you can just consistently zap into another body and hit a slitterhead in their vestigial, dangling human body, where they're most vulnerable. Each time you jump into a new host, you gain a boost to your melee damage, as well as what more or less amounts to three or four free hits since the enemy AI will attack the body you were previously in for a while before it realizes you've moved into a new one. Even that is more frustrating than fun, though. The combat system is loose and clumsy, causing you to swing past an enemy as often as into them, even when you use the lock-on system. And that's if the lock manages to survive between bodies. Often, it'll disengage, requiring you to swing the camera around madly as you reorient yourself just to get a couple of quick, boring hits in, before you repeat the process."
"And while bringing different Rarities into a mission might suggest a strategic plan of mixing specific abilities together, in practice, there's just not a lot going on there. All the Rarities are pretty effective, but many of their special moves don't bring enough to a battle to change its flow. Throwing bombs, zapping enemies with poison, setting traps around the battlefield--none of them change the fact that combat mostly entails just hammering the melee button before swapping to a new body and hammering it again. Many special moves require blood, which you also use for health. If a body takes critical damage with you in it on three separate occasions, you die, and you can't be outside of a body for more than a few seconds or it's game over, so using these abilities can make you very vulnerable. With slitterheads often hitting like a truck to send your hosts flying and the parry timings and directions rarely feeling like you can rely on them, you get a situation where most special abilities just aren't worth the risk."
"Some abilities do have their uses--summoning more humans, for instance, is usually a worthy tradeoff, and an attack with a magical chaingun lets you basically swap your Rarity's health for damage against an enemy, and it's not too difficult to recharge if you can slip away from a foe for a couple seconds. But most of the abilities are a lot less strategic. I never found myself happy when I summoned the weak stationary turret that shot intermittently at enemies, and the ability to charge up your weapon into an explosive bolt always took too long to execute in any actual combat situations."
"You're not always fighting slitterheads, though. Sometimes you have to use stealth to make your way through an area, which has the potential to be a fresh take on familiar tropes but winds up being far too simplistic. You can briefly pop out of bodies and float invisibly around an area, allowing you to peek around corners to avoid threats, and sometimes you can't get a body past a guard without being detected, forcing you to abandon one host for another further along. But guards walk short, obvious prescribed paths and never do anything unexpected. The stealth portions become extremely tedious and slow digressions where you make your way along an obvious path, and if it's ever not obvious, the Hyoki explains exactly what you should do and how."
"And sometimes you're searching for slitterheads, using your special powers that direct you to their locations and even let you temporarily ""sight jack"" them to see what they're seeing. These scenes represent another exciting idea that would be great if they required any brain power at all, like if you had to use your knowledge of Kowlong's locales and landmarks to figure out where a slitterhead was heading or what it was planning, but you never do. Instead, you just follow a glowing trail to the enemy and attack them. Other times, you'll get into a chase scene with a slitterhead as it flees through the streets, and not only are these always exactly the same, but also always annoying. They mostly amount to zapping from human to human to take a random swing in the direction of the running slitterhead as it passes until you finally whittle down its health enough to trigger the real fight, or you reach the end of whatever prescribed path it was running, and trigger in the real fight. Regardless, chases aren't fun; they require no particular skill, they offer no challenge, and they carry no stakes."
"The narrative is where the game could make up ground through its imaginative premise, but here too, Slitterhead looks deeper than it ever actually is. At first, you're just killing whatever monsters you come across, but you soon start to realize that hidden slitterheads are doing more than just snacking on the brains of whoever they can coax into a dark alley. They've taken over organized crime in Kowlong's slums, using sex workers as a means of luring in victims."
"That early element of the mystery--the revelation that the head-popping, brain-slurping monster mimics had decided to do regular crime stuff while also occasionally eating their customers--was pretty disappointing. As inventive as it might be to have these fiends roaming the city, their goals and motivations can't match their often-inventive creature designs. And while the game suggests that it means to flesh out the slitterheads themselves as the narrative unfolds, that element of the story ultimately doesn't really go anywhere. It's never clear exactly how the slitterheads work, what they think or feel, or what they're all up to. They're evil and you need to kill them; anything else is wheel-spinning."
"Some aspects of the story do get better as the tale goes on, at least to some degree. In between missions, you can talk with each of the Rarities you unlock, learning about them and deepening their connection with the Hyoki. When Slitterhead leans into this idea, it goes to some cool places. For instance, Julee--your first Rarity--isn't happy with the collateral damage that often results from the slitterhead hunts, encouraging you instead to limit civilian casualties when possible, and that has a notable effect on the Hyoki, who started the game by leaping off a roof in a human body and then zapping out into a new one at the last second because it was quicker than taking the stairs. Alex--another early Rarity who contrasts Julee--is bent on personal revenge against the slitterheads, and he has little regard for anyone who gets in his way, even if they're completely ignorant to what's going on. Both characters influence the Hyoki as time goes on, and the story starts to take on some dimension as their different viewpoints and ideologies expand and clash."
"Unfortunately, the other Rarities aren't nearly as compelling. There are eight altogether, but only one other than Julee and Alex has any narrative to speak of, and all are two-dimensional stereotypes. They include a sex worker with abilities related to her feminine wiles, a homeless man who wishes to spend most of his time drinking, a high-school nerd, an old woman who seems to have dementia, and a housekeeper who relates everything she says to cleaning. Overall, they have little to contribute. They're never written with anything other than surface-level characterization and weak jokes that play off their stereotypes, and apart from a couple of missions where you bring along a specific Rarity to open a door or provide a little information, they're incidental to the plot and their conversations are often sort of pointless."
"And while some aspects of the story develop in interesting directions, Slitterhead never succeeds in translating that intrigue into gameplay. Instead, like the combat systems, level design is repetitious and shallow. Time travel becomes a major element of the story after the opening hours, which brings its own intriguing ideas to the narrative, but the practical result is that you replay the same missions, in the same locations, over and over. Sometimes you need to go back and seek out additional Rarities or hunt for collectibles. Sometimes you'll play through a mission to a different outcome, or open a door you saw in a previous run to access a new small area, but ultimately it feels like Slitterhead is made up of the same four or five levels, with the same boring fights and frustrating chases, over and over."
"It feels like piling on at this point, but it also must be mentioned that Slitterhead is, largely, a pretty ugly game. Character faces are plastic, glossy, and largely unmoving, and while the slitterheads themselves are often cool-looking, since you fight a few variations on the theme over and over, they stop being visually compelling in a hurry. There's a lot of style in the game--opening title cards carry cool graphical effects, missions end with a neat freeze-frame ""To Be Continued"" message, and there are times when the presentation is artfully cinematic or knowingly horrific, hinting at what the whole experience could have been like. Gameplay, though, looks 15 years out of date, and it's bad enough to be distracting, especially when the game puts heavy emphasis on talking to characters to advance the story."
"Really, though, most things about Slitterhead feel out of date in this way. The body-swapping combat, RPG-like team of possessable people, the monster-hunting semi-paranormal narrative--they're all exciting until you engage with them a little, when they reveal themselves to be shallow and underdeveloped. The actual experience of playing Slitterhead is constant repetition of systems that aren't very engaging even their first time, across levels you'll see over and over again, telling a story that never makes much sense, with characters that feel like first-draft lists of stereotypes. Slitterhead has a lot of fascinating ideas and compelling gameplay on the surface, but beneath, it's just boring and banal--a bunch of scary-looking monsters who turn out not to be very scary at all."
"SaGa stands as one of Square Enix's longest-running series, but it's also had a rough time outside of Japan. If you pick up a random SaGa game, you'll probably understand why: SaGa games are JRPGs that don't do things in the way most overseas players would expect. SaGa tends to focus more on complex, interweaving systems of combat, character growth, and questing. And that's supplemented by narratives that tend to act more as connective tissue that link locations and objectives together instead of the sprawling, character-driven stories the genre has become known for. Wandering around blindly and piecing out what to do and how things work in a SaGa game can be incredibly compelling, but some entries in the franchise lean toward immensely frustrating. Romancing SaGa 2 is more the former than the latter, but its earlier releases were still an acquired taste."
"Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven is a full-on remake of a game many fans consider the series' apex--if not among the greatest RPGs of all time. If there's any game in the series that could reach out and capture a new audience in a way no other SaGa game has before, this is the one that could do it."
"Romancing SaGa 2's story begins ages prior to the modern day, when seven heroes fought to rid the land of evil forces. Their deeds have become the subject of myth and legend, and as times have grown ever more troubled, the people have yearned for their return. In the recent past, Emperor Leon and his two sons hear rumblings of the heroes' revival, but soon learn the horrible truth--the heroes have themselves become agents of evil, and they slay both Leon and his son Victor in a vicious attack. Despite this loss, there is still hope: Inheritance Magic, which allows an Emperor to pass memories, abilities, and strength down to an appointed successor, beginning with young prince Gerard."
"The inheritance system is one of Romancing SaGa 2's most-distinctive gameplay elements. Defeating the wicked seven heroes won't be accomplished overnight--in fact, it will take many generations and hundreds of in-game years, and each successive Emperor--whom you can often choose--takes up the task of their forebear where they left off. Even if you party-wipe--a condition that, in most other RPGs, would lead to a Game Over, you instead pick a new Emperor, amass a new party, and keep going."
"Since your quest spans centuries, you're allowed a certain degree of freedom in how to approach the task of defeating the heroes. Here's where one of the remake's best features shines: It offers helpful pointers to where quests and points of interest are, helping to alleviate the ""what am I able to do now"" problem that SaGa is notorious for. Most locations in the game are opened through exploration of a geographical region, being given information from an NPC, or through dialogue choices during questlines. You're not obliged to do the good majority of the game's quests beyond the beginning and ending events, but doing so can yield rewards: opening up new playable character classes, giving you access to new areas, or giving your Avalon Empire additional territory, meaning more money for your Imperial coffers--just to name a few. It's also possible to close off some questlines permanently by making specific choices or simply running out of time. You're not going to see everything Romancing SaGa 2 has to offer in a single playthrough, so it's best not to worry about optimization and instead follow the quest threads you find interesting and fun."
"You'll be spending a huge chunk of your time playing Romancing SaGa 2 in combat. This is one place where the remake has received a massive overhaul over the original. Battles are still turn-based, but instead of inputting all of your party's commands for the turn at once and seeing combat play out, you get a timeline where you can see when enemies will act relative to your party--and every action you choose executes immediately before moving on to the next character. The original's Weapon and Spell Points have also been consolidated together into Battle Points, which are spent to use both spells and weapon skills during combat, making resource management simpler."
"Also new is the Overdrive Gauge. Similar to Octopath Traveler, enemies have weapon and elemental weaknesses that will be revealed when hit by attacks. Exploiting these weaknesses fills up the Overdrive Gauge. When full, you can use it to have several party members fire off special attacks in a chain. Not only does this allow you to use several skills in immediate succession without a BP cost, but it also augments the damage those skills do significantly. As the game progresses and the enemies' stats grow to match yours, using the Overdrive Gauge will become incredibly important to quick and decisive victory--and using it for a big, powerful combo strike never stops feeling satisfying."
""
"But in order to get the most out of combat, you have to understand how SaGa's systems differ from what you're used to--though this particular remake makes a visible effort to demystify some of its more complex elements. Instead of gaining levels, characters gain stats and proficiencies based on their actions in battle: for example, if you use spears a lot when fighting, your spear skill levels will increase greatly in turn, affecting the damage you do with that weapon. Stat growth is significantly less obtuse than other SaGa titles, as you'll be able to see how close you are to making gains at the end of battle."
"Learning attack techniques also works in a distinct way. Not only does using weapons and magic increase your proficiency, but depending on a confluence of factors, you also have the opportunity to ""glimmer"" new skills in the middle of combat. These skills are tied to specific weapons and have their own branching trees. When you're close to learning a new technique, you'll see a light bulb next to one of your existing skills, indicating a chance of you glimmering a new skill if you use it. This is a marked improvement over some of the previous SaGa installments, where you essentially had to keep using skills in hope that something would trigger eventually. The skills learned by one character can be registered and taught to others in generations that follow, provided they have sufficient proficiency levels to equip them."
"Formations will be learned as you progress--you usually learn a new formation with every new Emperor--and placement of your Emperor and allies can have a tremendous effect by giving assorted status buffs/debuffs, as well as affecting AoE techniques. You'll want to strategize as much as you can, because there's still one scary SaGa staple to talk about: permadeath. Every character has a starting amount of Life Points when you draft them into your party, and they lose one every time they're KOed in combat. When their LP runs out, they are gone, including your current Emperor (though you're allowed to pick a new Emperor and carry on). It's not as bad here as in other series games, but having to run back and draft new party members because somebody gave up the ghost for good mid-dungeon is still not an appealing prospect. Since LP restoration is extremely rare, the need to keep your band away from getting KOed as much as possible adds a thrilling tension to both regular fights and boss battles."
"If this all sounds like an interesting mix of systems, that's because it truly is. Despite how initially abrasive they can be, when a SaGa game manages to grab you, it's hard to escape. Romancing SaGa 2's presentation and quality-of-life improvements do a fantastic job of making this far easier for series newcomers (and those who may have bounced off of other games in the series) to dive into. Even the story's been expanded upon significantly: it's still not as front-and-center as you might be used to, but you'll find a very interesting tale of how the Seven Heroes lost their way through finding memories and piecing together bits over the course of your campaign."
"It's not quite perfect, however. As the game progresses, battles get longer and more arduous--enemies scale stats up as your party does--and even standard-issue foes tend to hit hard. While you recover to full HP after each fight, you'll frequently find yourself straggling at the end of a dungeon, drained from having to use countless high-BP skills just to do a reasonable amount of damage. Restorative items exist, but are available in very limited quantities for the most part, so a lot of your time in dungeons winds up trying to navigate to avoid encounters--which becomes frustrating during those times when imprecise platforming comes into play."
"There's another reason to avoid encounters, as well. While this remake does a solid job at making certain game elements more transparent, there's still one that remains very mysterious: how the game's timer works. A combination of unseen factors, including the number of battles and completed-event flags determine when a generational shift to the next Emperor will happen and how many years pass in-between. This can be highly disruptive, interrupting current questlines and necessitating a time-consuming complete party reorganization. At least you have the option now for your current Emperor to immediately abdicate and reset these unseen timers, but it's still an element where giving the player more information would be a benefit."
"Regardless, Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven is a superb remake of a classic game that rarely received due recognition outside of Japan. It's filled with systems that are fun to explore and utilize alongside a core gameplay conceit that remains unique. If you're looking for a different take on JRPGs--or just a unique RPG in general--this is a lengthy journey you'll want to invest lots of time into."
"The best part of any Call of Duty game's Zombies mode is how it facilitates panic. The longer you play the round-based horde mode, in which the undead stream toward you from all directions, the tougher it becomes, and before long, you're sprinting around the map, trying desperately to stay alive as crowds of corpses shamble after you. Your only chance is to stop and fire away to thin out the approaching wave of undeath, hoping you don't run into any huge mutated monstrosity while your back is turned. Black Ops 6 is great at these moments."
"Zombies in Black Ops 6 is a return to the best-known and best-enjoyed form of the four-player cooperative mode, which developer Treyarch originated back in Call of Duty: World at War and has been iterating on ever since. Gone is the approach from last year's Modern Warfare 3, a messy take that bolted Zombies mechanics onto elements of CoD's battle royale game, Warzone. What Black Ops 6 offers feels like classic Zombies but enhanced, with a bunch of small elements old and new added together to build out the experience in fun, engaging, and challenging ways."
"The most notable change, and the one that works best with Zombies, is Omni-movement, Black Ops 6's adjustment to how you get around in the game. Omni-movement lets you move at the same speed in any direction, including sprinting, diving, and sliding, so you're able to change direction on a dime without losing momentum. It's a great addition to Zombies, where you will inevitably find yourself kiting a horde around the map as you fight to stay alive, only to suddenly realize that the path you're backpedaling down isn't as clear as you thought."
"Omni-movement really shines as the panic of these moments mounts and you're able to deftly change direction to slip around enemies to make good your momentary escape from certain death. The system adds an extra dynamism to Zombies because you're agile, especially compared to the undead, providing what feels like a lot of options to just run for it, where you can throw yourself over a rail or down a flight of stairs, firing as you go."
"That said, the mode is still as tough as ever, offering plenty of challenges to match the fact that being a little quicker on your feet might help you stay alive a little longer. New enemies, such as the spider-like Vermin, which can pop out of regular zombies as you gun them down and even transform into flying Parasites, change up the composition of the undead hordes, and you'll face special monsters like Manglers and Abominations pretty regularly, too."

"Black Ops 6's Zombies mode launched with two maps, and each has a different feel from the other. Liberty Falls is a small American town that's largely laid out on the side of a hill, forcing you to work your way up and down it a lot of the time and featuring a mess of pathways through buildings that can turn into bottlenecks if you're not careful, as well as ziplines at the top that can carry you quickly to rooftops. Terminus, on the other hand, is an island prison that hides a secret laboratory beneath it and tends to be more sprawling, giving you opportunities to drag zombies around in big circles. It's flanked by smaller islands you can reach by boat and includes a bunch of subterranean tunnels, making it feel like both a large open space and a winding maze as you explore it."
"The focus on these maps is twofold: Stay alive as long as possible, and scour the maps for intricate Easter eggs and narrative quests to complete. The approach on both is a little different--Liberty Falls starts mostly in the traditional way, with players unlocking doors to open up the map. On Terminus, each section of the map has its own dedicated generator, which you need to turn on and defend from zombies to power up the facility and things like Perk Cola machines located in each section. But the gist is the same here as in the past, with lots of secrets and story to uncover in both maps as you spend the Essence you earn from killing zombies to purchase weapons and upgrades."
"In addition to Omni-movement, Black Ops 6's take on Zombies works in a variety of systems both old and new that expand on your options in combat and how you approach the mode generally. There's collecting Salvage from enemies to craft gear, ""wall buy"" stations where you can purchase specific weapons and armor upgrades, and all the returning mechanics ranging from Perk Colas to Pack-a-Punch machines, including a new punch-focused one called Melee Macchiato."
"Returning from Black Ops 3 are GobbleGums, gumballs you can grab periodically that give you short-lived upgrades and which are distributed from a ""pack"" of possibilities you set ahead of time. Gobblegums do things like teleport you randomly around the map or create specific drops such as Max Ammo or Insta-Kill, but what's nice is you can pick them up when they appear and stockpile them to use when you choose. So in addition to the elements of Zombies like Bonus Points and Nuke pickups that drop randomly, and Perks you can buy to upgrade your character, you also have deployable, short-lived buffs that can give you a significant edge at the right time."
""
"Although Zombies still has you starting with a pistol and finding most of your gear throughout a run, Black Ops 6 adds the ability to set loadouts ahead of time, which let you customize some of the things you might eventually find or buy as you play. Your starting loadout also includes a Field Upgrade, a sort of ""ultimate"" ability that charges over time, like a Dark Ether beam that can burn through tons of zombies in a straight line, or an exploding Energy Mine that zaps lots of enemies in a specific area. Your loadout can include a dedicated melee weapon, and you can tune guns with attachments so that when you find or buy them during a Zombies run, they come out exactly the way you like them, instead of with random components."
"Finally among the customization options, there's the Augment system, which lets you equip a few specific upgrades that adjust how certain elements of Zombies work. Everything from perks to ammo types to Field Upgrades can be customized this way; you might equip an augment to the Juggernog perk that causes you to deal bonus damage when your health is low, or one that splits your Energy Mine ability into three mines instead of one."
"Augments have to be ""researched"" before you can use them, which is Zombies' major progression path--you can only research augments for one element of the game at a time, which pushes you to make specific choices about what's most important to you. You unlock three ""major"" and three ""minor"" augments for each element and can equip one of each for a given item, which works out to a lot of options to tweak and customize your upgrades and power-ups toward a specific playstyle or preference. The research system is slow-going because you can only work on one augment path at a time, but cross-progression at least means that whether you're playing Zombies, Black Ops 6's campaign, or multiplayer, you're still earning experience for augment research."
"With loadouts, augments, and Gobblegums, plus all the usual elements at play in Zombies, you wind up with a lot of stuff to think about, plan for, and customize within the mode, and that tends to deepen the experience significantly. There's just a lot you can mess around with or adjust to change how Zombies plays, providing lots of reasons to keep diving into and trying to survive the two maps--and that's before you even start worrying about the Easter eggs and story elements that tie them all together."
""
"Where Zombies struggles with all these new ideas, however, is in making them approachable to new or lapsed players. The Zombies mode has always catered to a hardcore group of dedicated fans, and has long been so convoluted and unclear that more casual players might bounce off. All those different systems and new additions can add to the confusion in a mode that already very much expects you to know how it works or spend a lot of time figuring it out. For example, I already knew about the augment system from previewing Black Ops 6 Zombies ahead of its release but didn't realize how the system worked in practice at launch, or that I wasn't earning any research credit until I actually went into its dedicated menu and assigned a research task. It's not that any one element of Zombies is particularly hard to grasp, but there are a lot of layers of systems and menus and elements to understand and keep in mind, increasing the density of an already-dense mode."
"Treyarch announced that it's going to release a ""guided"" version of Zombies sometime after Black Ops 6's launch, and as a more casual Zombies player, that's an element I'm really looking forward to seeing. Uncovering the hidden aspects of Terminus and Liberty Falls in Black Ops 6 is, as usual, very involved, and even more difficult when you're messing around on the maps with friends who aren't especially hardcore about Zombies. Bringing in new players is something that Zombies struggles to do, and the guided mode should help deal with that issue. As it stands now, it's great that Zombies in Black Ops 6 makes the simple act of fighting and staying alive as deep and engaging as it is. But it still requires a lot of dedication to understanding its intricacies and nuances, especially if you only pop into Zombies now and then--after all, it's been four years since Black Ops Cold War."
"Still, the return to round-based, Easter egg-hunting form for Treyarch's Zombies is, overall, very strong, specifically because it returns to a version of the mode and a lot of systems that are proven to work well together. It's more of a recombination and refinement of the mode than an especially innovative one, but here, that works very well, allowing Treyarch to push the envelope in the design of its maps and the way its systems work together rather than trying to force Zombies into a mold that doesn't fit it."
"Elements ranging from augments to Omni-movement to Gobblegums make it engaging and satisfying to fight through the hordes, even if you never go much deeper than trying to kill as many zombies as possible and then pull off a daring helicopter exfiltration. Though Zombies remains a little dense, especially for those less familiar with the mode, Treyarch's adjustments add a lot to enjoy about it, and do a great job of creating those breathless, panicky moments of fighting off the clawing undead that define the mode at its best."
"There's an argument to be made that speed is what makes Call of Duty multiplayer feel so good. As a franchise, the CoD games are great about getting you into the action as quickly as possible. When you shoot opponents, they tend to go down fast; when you die, you can be back in the fight in about a second. With Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, Treyarch leans into the speed of the franchise in just about every respect, starting with some meaningful adjustments to movement systems and ending with map designs that make sure you're never far from your next hail of bullets. Most of the time, those fast and intense battles are a lot of fun--but the design changes also result in Black Ops 6 feeling limited in the kinds of fights you're likely to face."
"The major adjustment Black Ops 6 brings to the series is the Omni-movement system, and at least in terms of how the game feels to play, it's an excellent one. Omni-movement does away with the pesky natural limitations of a pair of human legs. You can run, sprint, slide, and dive in any direction, regardless of where you're facing or where your momentum would take you. It's kind of akin to the freedom a tank turret has from the vehicle beneath it, able to turn in any direction to address threats, but much faster and much cooler."
"Omni-movement creates a really high degree of fluidity. The ability to move at full speed in any direction at any time makes it easy to quickly navigate maps and turn to address threats. The game never holds you back when it comes to movement, and paired with how fast you might gun down an enemy if you react quickly enough, or the speed with which they can shut you down, Omni-movement is an excellent improvement to your overall reactivity. This is a game that's about twitch reactions and sharp aim, and Omni-movement amplifies that twitchiness by giving you more freedom of motion in all cases."
"It's the sliding and the diving that's the most fun, though. Sliding and diving in whatever direction you want not only creates incredibly cinematic moments where you completely surprise someone as you whip around a corner or belly flop over a railing, it also gives you the opportunity to lie on the ground and target threats on any side of you in a way that was just never possible before. And to Black Ops 6's credit, while the moves are cool whether you're using them or they're used against you, they don't tend to make you invincible or even particularly hard to kill. Creative movement is just another tool in your kit, and you're as vulnerable as you've always been--you are not, in fact, Max Payne, so dive carelessly through a doorway and you'll still probably be dead before you hit the ground. Omni-movement is an extremely video-gamey addition to a first-person shooter, but it's undeniable that it fits perfectly with the nature of Call of Duty gameplay, and feels just as good."
"There's a drawback to Omni-movement, though, and it's that it can make Black Ops 6 an even more flop-heavy hop-fest than Call of Duty already was. There are times when you'll be in a match full of players moving at ridiculous speeds, flying through windows and around corners to blast you with shotguns--and if you're like me, you might be wishing for the Call of Duty days of yore when working together and utilizing strategy and tactics at least felt like it could be as important to a multiplayer fight as being the person with the most reliable hand for headshots and the twitchiest trigger finger."
"Black Ops 6 also tends to facilitate a lot of these close-range, fast-paced encounters with its map design. Maps are split into two categories: 12 regular maps that range more in size, and which pop up in your Quickplay and Hardcore game modes, and four smaller Strike maps, for chaotic 6-on-6 Face Off matches, or 2-on-2 modes like Gun Game. Even among the 12 maps that come up in most game modes, none is especially large, so you're never far from an opponent. They also tend to be quickly and easily traversed, so you can sprint around for a flanking position or make your way to back up teammates in a firefight very quickly. Each one offers a mix of interior and exterior locations and a fair amount of verticality, and they're all imaginative and distinct from one another, whether you're working through an abandoned factory or slipping in and out of hangars housing stealth bombers."
Read our Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Campaign Review
"The map designs make Black Ops 6's locales dynamic to fight in, with a ton of variety in the ways that players will meet and how you'll need to address a space in order to take down an opponent. Spaces tend to never be completely open or completely flat; there are always bits of rubble or piles of cargo that let you gain a height advantage or break up lines of sight, and that makes for a lot of strategically interesting battles. It's somewhat rare that you can find a decent-enough sight line to set up with a long-range weapon like a sniper rifle--instead, maps tend to send you snaking through rusting train cars, like in Derelict, or in and out of strip mall buildings as in Rewind."
"This means that as you enter any space, you really need to think about where opponents are going to be and how they'll be moving through that area as well as how you do. There's rarely much in the way of symmetry or simple shapes; there's always a lot of cover as well as a lot of flanking angles, and so you wind up with tons of different ways to approach any given firefight. All that makes Black Ops 6's maps fun and interesting, with a wealth of options, rather than a few dedicated lanes or central spots where all the fighting happens."
"If there's an issue with how maps are designed in Black Ops 6, though, it's that they often feel too cramped. It's not new that Call of Duty maps offer tons of pathways through any given area, such that you always have to expect someone to cruise up beside you and light you up while you're aiming down sights to protect a strategic position or put ammo down a hallway. But especially with players incentivized to run full-bore around the map at all times, Black Ops 6's multiplayer can sometimes feel like you've got nowhere to go."
"This is also an issue with respawns; the tight confines mean that in some maps, you'll drop back into the fight almost right where you left it. I've had several firefights where I've defeated an opponent and had that same person respawn in more or less the same place I killed them, looking right at me, causing me to lose a surprise rematch while I'm trying to get another magazine into my gun. Other times, I've been the one to respawn right back in the same place, where the three or four opposing players who overwhelmed me the first time were more than happy to drop me again."
"The tight confines can also limit the choices of guns that make sense to use on them more often than not. It's fine to have small maps as a variety of offerings in a multiplayer game, where close-range guns make more sense--but especially with all the extra diving and sliding Omni-movement makes possible and all the angles of approach you have to worry about as you move around, more often than not, close-range fighting becomes the default. Long-range weapons like marksman or sniper rifles generally feel kind of useless on most Black Ops 6 maps; there aren't that many long sightlines most of the time, and you're probably going to get shot from the side before you can set up to use one anyway."
"Still, everything is so fast in Black Ops 6, from encounters to movement to respawns, and it all works so quickly and so well that it's hard to be annoyed. Alongside Omni-movement making getting around feel great, Black Ops 6's gunplay stands up with the franchise’s excellent standard. Every gun is solid and lethal, and easy to be proficient with while also requiring the player to account for nuanced changes to firing rates and recoil intensity. This is the element Call of Duty has been getting right the longest, and Black Ops 6 doesn't disappoint with any of its weapons."
"Like with movement, Black Ops 6 makes a couple meaningful tweaks to loadouts and progression that add to the overall feeling of playstyle customization in multiplayer. The big focus on cross-progression between all modes means that you're always unlocking something no matter where you play in Black Ops 6, making it easy to quickly build up a base of custom options for different gameplay approaches in multiplayer. The game adds a few new Scorestreaks that offer fun options for your rewards, like the guided Archangel missile you can fire and then control to pilot straight into enemies, and the Watchdog helicopter that marks enemies as well as shoots at them, making it kind of like a deadly UAV. The Wildcard system from other Black Ops games also returns, allowing you to choose to add a particular gameplay tweak to your loadout--extra tactical gear like flashbangs, for example, or the ability to equip two primary weapons at the same time."
"Perks are divided into three categories--Enforcer, Strategist, and Recon--and if you equip three from the same group, you're awarded an extra perk that fits in the style of the others. With Enforcer, kills get you faster health regeneration and movement speed for a short time; Strategists get a bonus toward their Scorestreaks if they destroy enemy equipment or complete objectives, and can see enemy deployables through walls; and Recon nets you the ability to briefly see enemies through walls when you spawn and removes the death skulls from players you kill from the minimap. All of them encourage different thinking about the perks you bring into matches and give you a means of specializing your approach to gameplay. Particularly when going out with some pals, the specialization provides the sense that you're fulfilling a role on a team, while maximizing your specific approach to gameplay."
"Between Omni-movement, map design, and new options for loadouts, Black Ops 6 is full of relatively small adjustments that fit well with the underlying Call of Duty formula, without drastically changing it. Those adjustments often do tend to favor one kind of play over others--the bunny hopping, dolphin diving, in-your-face aggressive approach--but that's not necessarily always a bad thing, and playing with Black Ops 6's new movement system makes for some phenomenal action moments and great-feeling gunfights. The effects of Omni-movement and smaller battlefields have a tendency to have a limiting effect on what works in Black Ops 6 multiplayer at times, but with well-built maps, quick traversal, intense weapons, and interesting loadout options and rewards, the things the game does well are still a whole lot of fun."
"It's hard to believe it's been nearly a decade since the last mainline Batman Arkham game. Since then, we've seen several Arkham-adjacent projects come out, only to feel hamstrung or otherwise lacking. 2016's Batman Arkham VR was a neat tech demo, but it encompassed only the series' investigative elements. Both traditional Arkham studios, Rocksteady and WB Montreal, launched Batman-esque co-op games in recent years, but each struggled for several, sometimes similar reasons. Batman: Arkham Shadow stops the tailspin by authentically recapturing the essence of the Arkham series in ways other recent Batmanverse games disappointingly and intentionally avoided, making this the best Batman game since Arkham Knight, even if it doesn't soar to the same heights as the series' finest moments."
"Batman: Arkham Shadow is a VR-only, direct sequel to Arkham Origins, taking place roughly a year later. That means this version of Batman--once again played by Roger Craig Smith doing a solid Kevin Conroy impression--is still relatively untested and ornery. He's learning how to become the unflappable Batman we typically know him to be, so his temper can still get the best of him, and his uncanny ability to stay 10 steps ahead of his enemies isn't guaranteed. Played in first-person, you'll explore some enclosed sections of Gotham before ultimately landing in Blackgate Prison for the bulk of the game, giving this game a structure very much like the metroidvania-style design of 2009's Arkham Asylum."
"The Dark Knight's mission is to identify and stop The Rat King--a new enemy in the Batman mythology--who's thought to be hiding out in the prison just days before his catastrophic strike on Gotham unfolds. This sees Shadow's story unfold over the course of an in-game week rather than the usual overnight structure of Arkham plots, and sometimes, it shows."
"You'll spend about half of the game out of costume and disguised as an inmate, Irving ""Matches"" Malone, allowing you entry into the high-security prison. Some of the game's pacing in these sections doesn't match what the Arkham games would normally offer--a throwaway detail involves spending money at the commissary to buy cosmetics with which you decorate your prison cell, but the options are both too few in number and unappealing. But even cool options here would've felt like the wrong layer to add to the Arkhamverse."
"Batman doesn't hang out, regardless of whether he's dressed like an inmate or a superhero, so you'll only really see his cell when it's time to end the day. It's not merely dialogue when you're out of the cowl, though. There are still some enjoyable moments when playing as Matches, like some missions that ask you to sneak around the complex or fight other inmates without Batman's usual repertoire, but they pale in comparison to the standout time spent in Kevlar."
"One issue I kept returning to, regardless of Bruce Wayne's get-up, is a lack of notable villains. There are only a few boss battles in the game, and most don't involve Batman's major rogues. When I played Arkham Origins, it was hard to shake the sense that I was squaring off with Batman's B- and C-tier villains, for the most part. Firefly doesn't hold a candle (no pun intended) to Poison Ivy, Two-Face, or Joker."
"Arkham Shadow dials down the theatrics to an even lower level, swapping out someone like Origins' Deathstroke for Lock-Up, a hulking Tyger guard who struggles to feel like anything more than a souped-up common enemy. To its credit, Shadow also takes advantage of its story being early in Batman's career, letting you spend a lot of time around characters whose arcs fans know all too well, but you'll see them before they've fallen down their respective pits of darkness. That's standard prequel fare, but I enjoy it when it's done well in the Batman world, as it is here--in several cases, but one especially."
"On its story merits, Arkham Shadow can't match Rocksteady's best work. I've long believed Arkham City to be one of the greatest Batman stories regardless of medium, so the bar is extremely high, and though Arkham Shadow falls short of it, that's not to say it's a bad story. It gets better in the final act and has some great character moments. It authentically captures the mood of the other games, owed to its way of adopting both identical art direction and a similar-sounding original score. Arkham Shadow wants you to recall fondly your time with the earlier games in the series, and it wants you to believe it deserves to exist in that same place in your mind. And, despite a story that doesn't get there, most everything else does."
"Arkham Shadow is exclusive not just to virtual reality as a platform, but to the Meta Quest 3 (and its cheaper, slightly less-powerful sibling, the Meta Quest 3S). But in all the ways fans of the series would find important, it plays like a core addition to the lauded series. Unlike Arkham VR, Arkham Shadow ports over all three phases of the series' gameplay loop: combat, stealth, and detective elements."
"The combat is the surest sign that Shadow really works as a proper Batman game. For a Batman fan skeptical of VR or even someone who has simply never tried it, it would make for a jaw-dropping demonstration. It offers the same blend of fluidity and complexity of past games, highlighted by its signature counter mechanics being seamlessly transposed into VR, giving you the tools to take out a dozen baddies without so much as a scratch on your exposed chin."
"Rather than press a face button to activate the counter when the on-screen prompt appears, Shadow shows the same lightning bolt-like symbol on the left or right side of your interface, and to perform the move, you simply throw your arm out to the same side. Just like in other Arkham games, this allows you to pummel one guy, but then easily interrupt your own offense in favor of a counter that continues your combo meter, unlocking things like finishing moves and activating Batman's shock gloves. Importantly, the camera automatically shifts to have you face countered foes, though you can always turn on your own accord, too. It all feels just as fluid as the existing games in the series and earns the ""freeflow"" moniker in its own right."
"The same enemies you may know from the series return here, and each one adds a layer of combat complexity. A bigger, more brutish Tyger guard must be stunned with your cape--done in VR by making a hook motion with your arm without holding the triggers, which would instead translate to a fist/punch. Enemies with stun batons are scaled up and over using the right stick, then kicked in the back by raising and throwing down both of your arms. Those with knives need to be dodged by ducking before you can counter their attacks with your own, and riot-shielders demand a combination of cape-stunning and climbing before an overhead forearm smash. To Arkham veterans, these will sound familiar, as they're exactly what you'd do in the other games, and in a way I can't technically explain, the physics of it all feel exactly as I remember it to feel. Every combat encounter is exciting and approachable enough to allow for mastery of its systems, which naturally sends a tidal wave of dopamine coursing through you. In a manner I've never experienced before, I am Batman."
"This is just as uncannily true when moving through the world in all the ways you can as the hero. When gliding down from gargoyles, or bat-clawing over a ledge, you move at the same speed, and with seemingly the same animations, you'd be used to from other Arkham games. Here, you'll physically hold out both arms to your sides to perform a glide, rather than hold down a single button, but how it looks and feels is otherwise identical to before. A glide kick from 40 feet away includes the same look and feel that series experts will be used to. Even looking down at my legs when I was simply walking, Batman seems to have the same gait he always had in the series. I didn't expect this degree of duplication and probably would've settled for something quite like what I knew before. But this isn't just quite like it. It is it. Having played each of the Arkham games several times over, Arkham Shadow feels like coming home after some time spent away. It's familiar and faithful in all the right ways."
"While combat in VR includes about as many button presses as it does on a controller, performing stealth functions is a more physical, multi-step process. From atop a perch in an older Arkham game, you'd press one button to pounce on an enemy below and string them up like a warning sign to others during ""predator"" sections of the game. In VR, that one ability is performed in several smaller motions: First, you hold down the right stick to hang from the gargoyle, then you lunge at a nearby enemy with both arms, at which point you'll lift him up. You tie them automatically, but to complete the move, you then toss them away, like The Undertaker throwing Mankind off the cell in 1998."
"If it sounds complicated, it's really not. The on-screen prompts help it become second nature before long, and no move demands unforgiving precision. Like most VR games, it accepts something close enough to what it's asking for. Crouching behind enemies or popping out of grates beneath them to silently choke them out is similarly tactile, demanding you lunge at them by thrusting your arms forward, then throwing your arms side to side a few times to simulate a chokehold until they pass out."
"Batman's tool belt has been cleverly rebuilt for VR, too. The decoder that would unlock doors in past games is now a motion-based puzzle where you unholster the device, scan the lock, then search a small radar-like map in your hand to pinpoint the sweet spot that grants the unlock password. Other classic tools return, too, like the bat-claw that can rip grates off of hard-to-reach air ducts, or the explosive launcher that can be used to break down walls or even stun enemies mid-fistfight."
"Naturally, Shadow also includes detective vision, which you activate by moving either controller to the side of your head and clicking a trigger. It's a simple on/off switch that immediately recolors the world around you in the same light blue filter, in which notable objects such as quest items and tons of optional puzzles stick out in orange. The detective gameplay in this series has never been very complex--it's not Obra Dinn; you mostly just walk around interacting with the highlighted items so Batman can make his deductions automatically."
"That's true here too, but like before, I find even this simplistic take on detective work functions well as a reminder that Batman isn't just one part MMA fighter and one part ninja; he's also a gumshoe. Whereas the previous attempt to bring Batman Arkham to VR captured only this basic gameplay loop that usually doesn't survive such a spotlight, in Shadow, it's one relatively minor but still important piece to delivering a well-rounded, authentic Arkham experience."
"Given the game's metroidvanian world design, you can spend a lot of time off the main path to instead smash rat statues, destroy propaganda radios, and collect audio logs, among other puzzle types. Like Riddler Challenges before them, these puzzles are usually just tricky enough to reel you away from the objective for a minute or two, though plenty can't be completed until you unlock the right tools later in the story. Even if this is your first Arkham game, that aspect is well-telegraphed when it needs to be, like when you clearly have no way of reaching a vent far above you until you get the bat-clow. I always enjoyed these optional puzzles, evidenced by the fact that I could hardly ignore any one of them when I'd encountered it unless I wasn't equipped to beat it yet. To reach 100% game completion, you'll need to wipe the prison of these puzzles, as well as complete the game's enjoyable combat and stealth challenges, which unfold in arenas outside of the campaign--again representing another staple of the series."
"With all of these tools at your disposal and all of the gameplay tentpoles intact, Shadow also thankfully offers a lengthy list of movement and accessibility options so players can find their best play style. Three core movement styles make up the base options, but you can customize each of them further so that if you might like an immersive turning method, you can have it, even if you also prefer that with a heavily vignetted point-of-view, which is used in some VR games to reduce nausea."
"A few recent VR games left me nauseated, which confused me since I haven't historically had to deal with that. Thankfully, Arkham Shadow never did. I played the game in full on the middle-ground option between something for beginners (or those most nausea-prone) and those who want the most immersive VR experience. The game does seem to eat into my battery a lot, as I beat it in five roughly two-hour sessions, stopping not due to nausea, but because my 5% battery warning would appear."
"My foremost problem with Arkham Shadow is a lack of polish, which I consider different from the ubiquitous VR jank that pops up in Blackgate occasionally, like mangled forearms seen when opening some doors, or fingers that clip through held objects. The bugs I experienced were diverse in their nature, though thankfully not too numerous in their total instances. To name a few: Sometimes I'd get stuck behind an invisible wall, like when I'd deactivated an electrified barrier, but the game treated it like it still stood there. Other times, I'd load into an area and briefly witness a strange out-of-body experience where I watched from a great distance the entire game world laid into place before being teleported into the right spot. I'm not sure if it was a bug or just a lack of enemy barks and taunts, but in some fights, the bad guys I was scrapping with would too often repeat each other, too."
"Individually, none of these are game-breaking, but collectively, the broad swath of smallish but nagging issues stood out. A VR game usually takes a hit to its visuals as a starting point when compared to what a PC or console game could offer, so when I'd experience bugs like these on top of a lower-definition take on the Arkhamverse, it became a reminder that, however authentic this new style of Arkham game is to the classics, it still felt off at times."
"Admitting all that, I also know myself well enough as a critic by now to know that I don't tend to care about bugs as much as many others. If the core experience is strong--if the highs are high enough--I tend to forgive some missing polish. That's ultimately where I land with Batman: Arkham Shadow. The highs are high enough. Its story is a fun Batman romp that would work as a solid comic book arc, even if it can't touch Rocksteady's mainline saga. Moreover, it's by capturing the full spectrum of Arkham's still-exciting gameplay mechanics so effectively that Shadow becomes a must-play game for Batman fans, and a revealing measuring stick of how much virtual reality has advanced in just a few years. This isn't the first Batman Arkham game made for VR, but it's undoubtedly the first to feel like it belongs with the rest of the series."
"You wouldn't know just from looking at it--with its vivid, comic book-esque art style and irreverent punk-rock tone--but Redacted (officially styled as [REDACTED]) actually takes place in the same sci-fi universe as 2022's The Callisto Protocol. While that was a third-person survival-horror game trying to capture the same magic that Dead Space bottled up over a decade and a half ago, Striking Distance Studios has taken a wildly different approach with this spin-off, repurposing various elements from its debut game to create an isometric roguelike dungeon crawler."
"It's a drastic shift for the young series, ditching the grisly melodrama and Rock 'Em Sock 'Em combat of The Callisto Protocol by pivoting to referential humor and twin-stick shooting. It still feels immediately familiar thanks to how loudly it wears its Hades inspiration on its sleeve--even the title is seemingly a nod to Supergiant Games' seminal roguelike. This isn't inherently negative, and Redacted has some impactful ideas of its own. Yet, looking past the game's derivative design can often be difficult when it struggles to reach the same heights as its primary influence."
"Much like The Callisto Protocol, Redacted takes place within the icey, industrial walls of Black Iron Prison. With mutated biophages running amok--turning prisoners and staff into hostile, zombie-like creatures--you're cast as a modest prison guard attempting to reach the penitentiary's final escape pod and get the hell out of dodge. Unfortunately for you, other survivors--made up of coworkers and inmates called Rivals--are trying to do the same thing, forcing you into conflict with biophages and humans alike."
"Each failed escape sees your guard die and join the ranks of the infected while you begin a new run as another guard striving to reach the exit. Along the way, you'll accumulate various currencies, such as contraband and security codes, that carry over from one guard to the next, letting you purchase new permanent weapons, skills, and so on in the game's starting hub area. Aside from creating a gradual sense of palpable progression, this also ensures that failed runs rarely ever feel like a waste of time, as you're constantly making future attempts slightly easier."
"It's a similar setup to Hades, challenging you to fight your way through four different zones in a single run, with a formidable boss waiting at the end of each one. Randomly selected battle arenas populate these zones, and you're given a choice of doors to enter after defeating every last enemy in an arena, letting you choose between being rewarded with various buffs (called experiments) for your current run or the aforementioned currencies that can help you in subsequent attempts. Again, much like Hades, you're given three of these buffs to choose from after clearing a room. One might increase your health or add elemental damage to one of your weapons, while others can alter how your firearm functions or augment your dodge with damage-dealing effects. These buffs can also be leveled up depending on the doors you choose, thus making you more powerful the longer you survive a run."
"All of this eventually makes for a satisfying gameplay loop. I say ""eventually"" because Redacted doesn't make a particularly great first impression. You embark on each run equipped with two weapons--one ranged and one melee--but your initial options are lacking in the fun department. The pistol, shotgun, and assault rifle are slow to fire and lack any kind of gratifying punch. Meanwhile, the violent swings of your melee options feel labored and stilted, which sadly doesn't change even after unlocking every available weapon. Some of the potential buffs improve things, but then you're relying on the game's RNG to make combat enjoyable."
"Fortunately, your ranged options do steadily improve, lending each fight a more frenetic and fast-paced feel as you unlock more permanent weaponry. Melting biophages with the scorching energy beam of the atom gun is delightfully pleasing, as is evading projectiles as you pepper enemies with dual blasters. It's still disappointing that melee combat quickly becomes an afterthought, though. Bashing an enemy upside the head is useful in spots, but I quickly learned to neglect melee buffs in favor of improving my firearms because it just isn't very engaging."
"This results in combat feeling somewhat one-note, although the sheer variety of enemy types keeps you on your toes--forcing you to evade all kinds of projectiles, exploding mutants, and melee-focused threats. You can kick enemies, but I never found this to be a particularly useful skill. You also have access to The Callisto Protocol's kinesis-like GRP ability, letting you launch enemies backward to create breathing room or send them hurtling into various environmental hazards. Flinging a biophage into a vat of toxic green acid is certainly satisfying, but your use of GRP is limited."
"It helps, then, that Redacted looks fantastic throughout. The game's comic book art style pops off the screen with a wonderful vibrancy, coating explosions and smoke effects in halftone dots as your resplendent attacks punctuate through the noise. This, along with the game's twin-stick shooting, is eventually strong enough to prop up Redacted's combat on its own, even if it does lead to tedium in the latter hours."
"Before then, however, your first objective is to survive a run through all four zones and escape the prison. Once you've achieved this for the first time, weapon upgrades are unlocked and you're able to activate a plethora of difficulty modifiers to increase the game's challenge and earn extra rewards. Whether you're decreasing your overall health, adding a timer, or increasing the number of enemies in each room, there are multiple ways to shake up the experience."
"You fight your past self, too, seeing as your most recently deceased guard will quickly join the undead ranks. Challenging one of your failed attempts to a battle is optional and basically boils down to whether they have an upgraded buff you might want to use again. Depending on the weapons and upgrades they had when they died, these zombified guards can be fairly formidable foes, and I never felt the reward was worth the considerable risk."
"As for why you might want to escape Black Iron Prison more than once--there is a lone incentive. Unlike Hades, where the story propels you through one successful run after another, Redacted's stimulus isn't quite as appealing, but I'll get to that in a minute."
"You see, amidst the chaos of each escape attempt, you also have to contend with the game's Rivals. These escaped inmates and former colleagues of yours are a one-dimensional assortment of stereotypes, from a Dungeons and Dragons-obsessed LARPer to a dreaded Karen and punk-rock Cockney. There isn't much of a narrative to speak of, with most of their dialogue focused on referential humor. There are a few funny moments, but the reference is usually the whole joke, whether they're name-dropping The Simpsons or Hades itself."
"Where Rivals excel is in how they add another random element to each run. There are eight Rivals in total, but you only have to contend with three at a time. Like you, they're trying to reach the final escape pod first, essentially turning each run into a frantic race to the finish. You can slow down one Rival at a time and chip some life off their health bar by utilizing remote attacks. The catch is that they respond in kind, throwing a spanner into the works with gas leaks you need to hurriedly switch off and bombs you must avoid as they fall from the sky."
"It's not all remote work, either. Occasionally, you'll come face to face with one of your Rivals in a mini-boss-style fight to the death. If you manage to kill them, that's one less person to contend with once you've reached the escape pod; otherwise, you're thrown into a gauntlet against everyone who survived. It's great stuff and stands out as the one element of Redacted that differentiates it from other roguelikes, adding a thrilling wrinkle to an otherwise familiar gameplay loop."
"Once you've completed your first successful escape, Rivals also become your primary focus if you want to reach the game's end credits. Each one has a redacted dossier full of irreverent information about their lives, but it's the passcodes hidden within that you really want. Eight passcodes for eight prisoners, and you need all of them in order to open up a vault containing who knows what. This is Redacted's endgame, if you can call it that. So off you go, looking for the doors marked ""Computer"" scattered throughout each run. You can unredact a single paragraph from inside, of which there are 10 for all eight Rivals. That's 80 files to uncover, and the best-case scenario during a single run is to find, at most, four or five of these Computer rooms."
"It's a lengthy endeavor. In total, it took me 17 hours to reach the end credits, encompassing 40 runs and 14 escapes. Your prize for doing all of this is a final do-or-die run back through the prison, where death means you lose all of your progression, and success means you unlock some new permanent gear. It's not the most enticing prize. After 17 hours, I couldn't imagine returning for more, especially when the only incentive for playing any longer was removed. Obviously, this isn't unusual, and Redacted still has a significant amount of replayability. It's just disappointing that the final reward is so lackluster when the journey to achieve it is a slog."
"Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and it's hardly uncommon in the video game industry. Nonetheless, it's difficult to recommend Redacted when both Hades and its sequel exist and do almost everything it's attempting to do with much more aplomb. The Rivals system is a compelling breath of fresh air for the genre, and its combat is engaging--even if parts of it are severely lacking. There's a good game here, somewhere in the middle, once you're past the lackluster opening and monotonous ending. Redacted doesn't really expand on The Callisto Protocol universe, but I'm glad it exists. For as flawed as both games are, I still haven't lost interest in seeing more stories from this world, and I hope Striking Distance has a chance to tell them. Redacted just falls short a few too many times."
"Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 remains my favorite of developer Treyarch's contributions to the long-running and sometimes formulaic shooter franchise, because it's the one that takes the most wild swings. It mixes traditional Call of Duty linear levels with a top-down, real-time-strategy-like experience that lets you move troops around the battlefield and then zoom down like a gunslinging ghost to possess any one of them and do the fighting yourself. It also logs your choices, your successes, and your failures, and adjusts its convoluted branching narrative to account for them."
"The spirit of Black Ops 2 is alive in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and not just because it actually serves as a semi-prequel-sequel to that 12-year-old game. Black Ops 6 infuses the standard Call of Duty formula with level designs and mission ideas that challenge the usual Call of Duty framework in much the same way. It's not as brazen as Black Ops 2 was--that game was admirable for going all-out, but not all of its ideas were home runs in execution--and there's no branching narrative or major departure from Call of Duty gameplay in Black Ops 6. Instead, Treyarch works in creative but familiar design additions that break up and expand on its campaign, making for an experience that maintains the franchise's cinematic, high-yield explosiveness, while also providing numerous opportunities to feel like a super spy and super soldier."
"There's a lot of story going on in Black Ops 6, but as is usually the case in the franchise, it's at once both pretty simple and weirdly complex. The gist is that, as part of a covert mission during Operation: Desert Storm, your CIA operative player character--a silent protagonist named Case--and his teammates Marshall and Harrow run into Russell Adler from Black Ops: Cold War. From Adler, you learn about The Pantheon, a paramilitary organization full of American ex-soldiers and others, operating secretly inside the CIA but with their own evil agenda. The rest of the game is about teaming up with Marshall, Adler, and Black Ops mainstay Frank Woods, recruiting a couple spies, and trying to figure out who The Pantheon is and how to stop them. It's all standard fare for a game like this."
"It's in the missions themselves that things get a little less predictable. The covert operations thrust means that while you'll sometimes do missions where you just march forward and shoot guys in an approach that harkens all the way back to the beaches of Normandy and the first Call of Duty, there are also plenty of other moments where you need to be sneaky and careful. Your mission to bring aboard master of disguise Sev is a low-profile trip through mob enforcers, in which you listen in on a phone call and then assassinate an underling. You're more or less free to figure out your way into a well-guarded church belltower to set up for the shot. You can blast your way in or stealth your way through, and while the level isn't huge or expansive in an immersive-sim way, there are enough options that your choice of how to approach the problem feels meaningful."
"There are a bunch of opportunities for stealth like this. Black Ops 6 isn't great as a stealth game--enemies are dumb as hell, their peripheral vision is basically nonexistent, and you can crouch-walk right behind them with zero consequences. But the weak stealth works because the density of enemies in any given area makes up for their lack of brains, and because of how great it feels to crack off a headshot with a silenced pistol on a soldier you forgot about right before he calls for help. Call of Duty's consistently great gunplay means that when stealth fails, it just leads back to what the franchise is best at. It also means you can save a scuffed attempt at sneakiness by fluidly taking out all the enemies in a room before they realize what's going on, and doing so is satisfying every single time."
"Several missions use this combination of stealth, action, and freedom in approach to problems to solid effect. When you head back to Desert Storm, the mission takes on a sort of wide-linear design, where you jump in a car with your team and drive around a big map, completing objectives as you see fit. Scouting an approach, tagging enemies with a special camera that highlights them for you, gives the whole affair a Far Cry-lite feel."
"The mission isn't as robust or systematically interesting as Far Cry, but that little extra freedom and planning is a great way to lead into Call of Duty's over-the-top battles when you finally start shooting. Your job here is to assault some big, well-defended Scud missile launchers, but you can also wipe out Pantheon camps to gather intel on the group's plans, save a band of crashed Delta Force soldiers, and knock out anti-air missile batteries to allow for air support. Completing the side objectives gives you Scorestreak rewards like the ability to call in an attack helicopter or an airstrike; coupled with the many gadgets Black Ops 6 includes, you wind up with a lot of creative, explosive ways to solve problems throughout the mission."
"And to Black Ops 6's credit, this formula is never repeated. Instead, Treyarch fleshes out an idea for a single mission, uses it well, and then leaves it. There's a horror-themed level that gets pretty spooky, an infiltration level that pushes your spy abilities a bit, and even a heist level in which you play as each member of the team as they complete their portion of the plot, Ocean's 11-style. When you sneak into a Bill Clinton campaign event to get a senator's retinal scan, you get multiple options for how to set up a chance to photograph him; I followed his aid to learn about a blackmail scheme, stole the compromising material from the blackmailers, and then turned it over to the senator's wife in exchange for the shot I needed. You get a couple of opportunities to make choices like this throughout the campaign. They don't drastically change the overall formula, but they give you a little more agency and influence on how a mission shakes out."
"The creative additions to Black Ops 6's missions are consistently fun and even surprising. While none of the levels blow the doors off in terms of new ideas--the horror level makes liberal use of Zombies from that game mode, the heist leans pretty hard on those somewhat-anemic stealth mechanics--they're tried-and-true additions that work well with Call of Duty's underlying gameplay. Black Ops 6 lacks Black Ops 2's willingness to take big swings, but it does add some solid variety to the usual Call of Duty experience, even if those additions are still a bit conservative."
"In addition to Call of Duty's usual solid shooting mechanics, which make all the guns feel punchy, lethal, and exciting to use, Black Ops 6 throws the usual load of gadgets your way. The exploding RC car is back, and you can use things like an adrenaline shot that slows down time, a knife that homes in on enemy faces, and a throwable taser that stuns whoever it hits. All those items are available in most missions, and you can carry and switch between all of them, giving you more options for creatively addressing firefights."
"In a fun twist, Black Ops 6 deploys Pantheon ""elite"" enemies that have many of those gadgets, too. For example, one hides behind cover and sends exploding RC cars at you, forcing you to shoot them before they reach you; another leaves taser traps all over the battlefield that will stun you if you get too close. Elites aren't in every battle, but when they appear, they force a change in strategy that's more interesting and thoughtful than what's needed to deal with the usual cannon fodder soldiers."
"Gadgets give you some options for how you approach fights within the game, and you can also tune your playstyle in a few different ways by purchasing upgrades for your character at the safehouse where you spend time between missions. These exist along three different tracks, related to your physical abilities, weapons, and gear, and the system incentivizes you to scour missions for extra cash so you have the resources to purchase them. Many of the upgrades are similar to the perks you can choose in multiplayer, while others are minor boosts."
"Early on, when your money is limited, the upgrade trees give you some choices to customize your play style--if you want more gadgets or to have their effects last longer, you can pay for those upgrades, but if you'd rather be quicker on the draw or carry more ammo, you can opt to improve those elements instead. Eventually you can purchase all the upgrades, which give you a lot of small enhancements that, taken together, make you a more powerful Call of Duty character. The upgrades give you a little more freedom and agency in tuning your approach to Black Ops 6, but none of them are so substantial that they'll drastically change how the game plays, even when you have them all. The upgrades are nice adjustments to the usual approach that fit well with Call of Duty's shooter mechanics, but like other additions, they're tweaks to that formula rather than significant edits."
"There's also the new omni-movement system, which allows you to sprint, slide, and dive in any direction without losing momentum, and it feels pretty good in practice. Gameplay never demands you make use of the system, but it adds a little fluidity to gunfights when you run and slide into a new cover position or pull an action-movie dive as you unload on an opponent. It's generally a good addition that makes everything feel a little smoother in Black Ops 6, but I wish it got further emphasis or was amplified to be more necessary and useful."
"A usual lament for these games is that the story can't keep pace with the gameplay, and that's the case in Black Ops 6 as well. Character dialogue is constantly oscillating between in-the-know military jargon and wall-to-wall cliches. Still, spending time with your team in one-on-one conversations makes for some of the best moments in the game, and Black Ops 6 gives you plenty of opportunities to do so in the safehouse. A big part of what makes Black Ops 6 engaging is its phenomenal performances, matched by excellent face scans and animations that capture a lot of nuance in the actors' portrayals. Everybody in this game looks great, and when they're not spouting off strings of cliches, quips, and idioms, there's a fair amount of emotion that makes them relatable."
"In particular, new additions Sev and Felix are well-rounded characters, and I always found myself hoping for more of them. The game threatens to do particularly interesting things with Felix, a former East Berlin spy who defected to the West. Felix is a legendary operative and technical genius who has sworn off violence when he joins the team. You can question him about it a few times, always in a sort of ""are you serious ... are you sure about that"" kind of way, but Felix espouses clear convictions about how he feels and what he's done. It's a shame that, later in the game, his convictions aren't as core to his identity, but he at least has some great dialogue that explores his arc. If only the game had followed that thread further."
"Sev is similarly cool and similarly underused. She formerly served the mafia family you help her dismantle in an early mission--after she was betrayed by the people she trusted, something she'll tell you about if pressed, she launched a bloody campaign of revenge. She might be the best operative on the team, and a mission where you play as her in disguise, wandering around an enemy camp finding ways to sabotage their equipment, is another winner, even if it's undercut a bit by the stealth system. Sev has a moment where Marshall doesn't let her join everyone else on a mission and she gets pretty angry about it, and while there are hints that this could be something to explore in her character as well as those of the rest of the team, Black Ops 6 never really digs in. There are several revealing and emotional character moments in the campaign like this, and it's a shame Black Ops 6 never commits to making them meaningful for the larger narrative."
""
"I still don't really get the larger narrative, and the inclusion of elements like the digital Clinton cameo or a raid on a Saddam Hussein palace play like additions to try to make a weirdo story feel more realistic and less meaningless, without accomplishing either. Like a lot of these games, Black Ops 6 gestures in the direction of some larger point about spies and operatives fighting shadowy wars for unaccountable people, but eventually trails off without committing."
"I got especially lost in a late-game turn where you spend a bunch of time inside the mind of the villain during an interrogation. It's a reminder that Call of Duty games often have the problem of acting like they expect you to know more than you do, and thus always causing you to feel like you missed something or are forgetting a crucial point. This person has appeared in, like, two scenes--should I know who they are? Were they in past games? Should I care about their moral struggles and tragic backstory? The whole sequence is an effort to humanize a character I had almost zero relationship with, so it amounts to a lot of illusory wheel-spinning. It doesn't help that surreal shattered-landscape-of-the-mind levels like this have been done to death by plenty of games--including Call of Duty, as they were basically the focus of Black Ops 3."
"Your main player character, Case, also has weird ""should I know what's going on here"" moments that recall Alex Mason's brainwashing in the original Black Ops, but to much less interesting or goofy effect. It's a half-baked addition that doesn't have much bearing on the story except right at the end, making for a bewildering conclusion. There are a few things in Black Ops 6, like Case, the villain, and the overarching Pantheon conspiracy, that end up feeling like good ideas that just sort of peter out. While many people may not come to a Call of Duty game for the story, Black Ops 6 disappoints because it does occasionally come close to telling a pretty good one."
"Still, the overall experience of Black Ops 6 is enjoyable, mostly due to its willingness to work in a variety of different ideas and approaches to its levels before bringing you back to the familiar and reliable shooting of a million enemies. Black Ops 6 is at its best when it gives you all its tools and lets you loose to deal with a problem as you see fit. It provides a lot of those opportunities, adding just enough to the underlying gameplay that you get the satisfaction of formulating a strategy and executing it, as well as the fun of dealing with the fallout, whether it goes to plan or not. Black Ops 6, like Black Ops 2, combines gameplay ideas to make something that feels a little different from the usual for Call of Duty, and while not every system or addition is a knockout, taken together, they make something that shows how Call of Duty games can grow without losing what makes the franchise great."
"A Quiet Place has quickly grown into one of the better horror franchises of the past decade. Three movies deep, the creature features have explored a fascinating world in which blind aliens use a highly keen sense of hearing to hunt humans desperate not to make a single peep. Translating that incredibly slow and silent story universe to a video game makes for a novel project, and I can see why A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead has launched so quietly itself. It's a strange mission to assign players, but it's one I'm glad to have experienced--despite a host of issues."
"A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is a first-person stealth-horror game starring a cast of characters new to the series but similarly seeking to find safety from the swarm of aliens who have commandeered Earth by force. As Alex--an asthmatic college-aged woman with a boyfriend, a dad, and a range of other perpetually silent allies--players embark on a road trip that will test her ability to crouch-walk pretty much forever."
"That design direction could easily make for a frustrating video game. In games that allow me to upgrade my crouched movement speed, I've always unlocked it as soon as I can--I like stealth games a lot and so I tend to want to improve that facet of such a game. So it's notable to me that The Road Ahead doesn't just demand you crouch-walk through almost every moment of its 7-to-10-hour story, but forces you to do it very slowly, usually barely pushing on the left stick, because the aliens in the game behave unpredictably like Alien: Isolation's Xenomorph and tend to hear even a crouched footstep performed at full speed."
"This is made more complex due to the various surfaces and obstacles that you'll have to dodge in any mission. Debris such as tin cans, wood planks, leaves, and puddles litter the pathways between you and whatever typically minor environmental puzzle stands in your way of progress, like collecting and using fuses to unlock doors. Every step in this game matters, and that leaves you to understand quickly that you won't survive a rushed attempt to do, well, anything."
"Early in the story, Alex pieces together a phonometer that quantifies environmental noise against her own noise-making. If the latter measure exceeds the former, the alien is liable to hear her, and depending on which difficulty you're playing on, she can only survive two or three blips on the alien's figurative radar before it's going to pounce directly on her, or at least rush over to where the noise was made."
"In the best of the game's missions, the aliens are roaming freely in the space with you, while in others, they're unseen but erupt into a quick game-over screen if you've made too much noise. I found the alien to be extremely perceptive regardless of the difficulty, having played on all three--there's also an ultrahard ""survivor"" mode which seems impossible given the unforgiving adeptness of the game’s central monsters."
"Doors and drawers have to be opened often, both to progress through levels, but also to seek out supplies like inhalers to treat Alex's asthma or batteries to power her flashlight. The process of opening any door or drawer takes, remarkably, 8-10 seconds if you don't want to alert the monster, which forces you to perform every action like a teen sneaking out of their house at night, only with much higher stakes."
"These moments demonstrate, best of all, how The Road Ahead could easily not work for many or most players. I've never seen a game demand so much patience, but it's all in service of capturing the authentic feeling of the movies, in which the monsters are also hyperaware. Alex holds both her phonometer and her flashlight in her left hand, so she can only use one at a time. This creates a thoughtful trade-off that's constantly being considered: Would you rather see the dark path in front of you or do you need to quantify the noise you're making? The phonometer can help you know how alert the alien is to your presence, but without a flashlight, you're liable to bump into something so noisy that you won't need the photometer to tell you that you're screwed."
"As the story goes on, both Alex and the monsters add tools to their repertoire. Alex can throw bottles and bricks, or lay planks--again, slowly and silently, or else--to create shortcuts through an area. Later in the game, things like flares for Alex and a scan the aliens perform that can identify any noise you make, even if it doesn't exceed the environmental soundscape, add additional layers to the survival story. She can even create shortcuts using the alien by throwing a brick through a window, which causes the alien to sometimes smash through the attached wall, letting her into a space that was closed off before. The game's unfathomably slow cat-and-mouse missions are its very best, even as some of them lack many or even enough ways to be this creative."
"In general, I found The Road Ahead to introduce cool ideas routinely, but then it wouldn't always iterate on them enough. For example, you can find bags of sand in the world, which you use to create silent pathways in front of you, just like characters do in the movies. But every section that used sandbags offered too many of them, leaving me not to worry about creating the optimal path. Instead, I'd build a self-contained highway of safe passageways so I could always have an exit route if the alien was closing in, unaware of my presence. At some other points, throwable bricks are stacked in infinite supply. I wish I had to think about how I'd use these tools more than I did."
"Checkpointing is occasionally frustrating, too. Usually, the game auto-saves whenever you complete a major section of an area, like assembling one of two or three total items you need to progress. The issue arises when one step in a multi-step process is so involved that starting even that portion over feels disheartening. In two different instances, I also had to reset an area due to bugs that plainly came off like a lack of polish. The first instance let me into an area meant to be closed off until I found a key. I hadn't found it yet, but assumed I'd just missed the fact that I had since I got through to the other side. I could see where I was meant to go next, but the game wouldn't let me do so because I'd wiggled into a purgatorial state where I found myself in the right place at the wrong time."
"Something similar happened in the game's last level when I climbed a roof and elected to open a hatch given the on-screen prompt, but in truth, no hatch existed, which trapped me in the geometry and demanded I reset from the last checkpoint. It felt like a remnant from a previous version of the level. Similar to how the game doesn't always go far enough with its cool ideas, it can sometimes feel a bit unpolished."
"Alex's asthma is gamified in that enough stress can set it off. This means both physical stress, like lifting heavy barrels to open up a pathway, but also more psychological stress, like spending time near the monster. Often, the creature will be just inches away. It's all as wonderfully tense as it should be, and that may set off a quick-time event in which you, as Alex, can have the asthma attack (and thus alert the alien). You’ll need to stave it off momentarily as you seek out inhalers or other aids, or completely overcome it with a perfect button press. I found these to be easy enough not to fail but I rarely perfected them, which is good; I didn't feel like the storm was over, so it became an additional concern as I'd tip-toe around the monster."
"Along with her respiratory condition, Alex is also suffering in a few other ways I won't spoil, but I find her to be full of contrived circumstances meant as shortcuts to elicit player empathy. The overall arc of the story is enjoyable, but I was always mindful of how the writers threw so much on her figurative plate rather than drilling down on one facet of who she is to explain why I should care about her. The interactive element of video games is already an empathy bridge as is, so some of her backstory and the things that happen to her in the course of the story just feel like desperate piling on to make sure players are emotionally invested."
"The extremely slow pace will be polarizing, but for me it was a job well done, even as it wasn't always done as well as it could've been. I find this novel pace to be a great quality to the game, and it never directly frustrated me. What got under my skin were tangential to this, its best quality, such as oddly barren audio settings and those aforementioned bugs."
"I play all my games with headphones, and I was surprised to find this one, with such an intense focus on sound, doesn't offer even rudimentary sound options like switching to an output suited for headphones. As a result, the game often sounds flat when played with a headset. There is at least an option to let the alien pick up your mic audio, which I found works well thanks to custom calibration options. I toyed with it at different times but ultimately left it off for most of my playthrough given I have two kids and a dog in my house and didn't want Alex to die at the figurative hands of the Bluey theme song."
"It may seem like I have a lot of complaints for The Road Ahead, and if you count them individually, my frustrations do outnumber the parts I enjoyed. However, I also find its novel stealth-horror approach interesting enough to merit seeing it for yourself; its best parts are greater than their sum. A patch could resolve some of the polishing issues--though given how this game was tossed into the world with little marketing, I wonder if the team is even assigned to do more with it."
"A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is a certainly flawed but also intriguing attempt to make a video game out of a premise that seems not to be conducive to this medium. Crouch-walking around a monster for several hours should've probably been a worse experience, but it proves to be a sound idea that may have been a cult classic if it only had more attention to detail."
"Blumhouse Productions is arguably the biggest name in Hollywood horror today. The studio's ubiquitous logo appears before what feels like every other theatrically-released horror movie. It's clear the company has made the genre its focus, and I love that. It means there's always more to look forward to, even as results surely vary. With Fear The Spotlight, Blumhouse marks its debut in video games, which similarly excites me. Its games will also surely vary in quality, but this indie ghost story is a memorable debut, both for the burgeoning publisher and the pair of developers who built it together."
"Fear The Spotlight stars Amy and Vivian, two high-school friends sneaking around school after-hours as soon as the game begins. Amy is dressed like a Hot Topic kid, while Vivian looks bookish. It gives the pair the air of an odd couple, but exploring their friendship while things go bump in the hallways helps introduce the story as they uncover a shady school history over the course of the game's initial three-to-four-hour campaign."
"Fear The Spotlight uses a PS1-style aesthetic mixed with modern touches like an over-the-shoulder perspective. In many moments, the game also switches to point-and-click mechanics, mostly whenever the game's puzzles are being toyed with. It's both those puzzles and the game's scares that give Fear The Spotlight its gateway-horror vibe, and I enjoy it for that even if I'm no longer in the target audience. Though I love when games are especially terrifying, I also feel like younger or less-experienced horror fans deserve entertaining scares they can stomach. Not every game should be Outlast or Amnesia on the spooky scale."
"Fear The Spotlight isn't very scary to me, but it would work well as an introduction to the genre for the right player. That's intentional on behalf of the two people who made the game together, so it's not that Fear The Spotlight falls short of its goal. It sets out to be a horror game for teens most of all, and the high-school setting and characters work well to serve that audience."
"With no combat mechanics to speak of, this is more of an adventure-horror game than survival-horror. That's a subgenre that I've found over the years to be extremely difficult to pull off, as a horror game without much in the way of enemies or game-over screens can feel like it lacks stakes--and thus scares, too. But Fear The Spotlight works in several enemy interactions that play out in a hide-and-seek manner. You can't fight the monster at the heart of this dark story, so you'll sneak under classroom desks, library carts, and lunch tables, avoiding its gaze as best you can while sometimes solving puzzles right under its nose--figurative nose, that is."
"Puzzles are a major part of the short story and abide by classic survival-horror tropes. Nothing is linear when you're moving through its world. Collapsed hallways are circumvented with tools obtained through multi-step processes involving reading notes that provide clues and tracing the steps of those who were there before you. You'll find weird locking mechanisms in doors that require crests, or strange dolls that need to be smashed in an order teased out via an odd poem nearby."
"For fans of classic Resident Evil and Silent Hill games, the puzzles in Fear The Spotlight will feel familiar, though they have one quality that separates them from those genre forerunners: They're all much more contained. Rather than explore, say, a large mansion or a foggy town, where a puzzle item you find is actually needed many meters and perhaps hours from then and there, the puzzles in Fear The Spotlight tend to involve only a few locations somewhat near each other, like when they ask you to move between two hallways and four classrooms total. Just as the scares are toned down for a horror-beginner audience, the puzzles won't halt your progress for long. In a sense, they tutorialize the traditional design concepts of horror-game puzzles."
"My biggest issue with Fear The Spotlight is its story. For a rather short game, it's trying to do a lot at once, opening with what seems like a bullying theme before diverting down a very different path. All the while, the game is trying to tell a more personal story between Vivian and Amy, too, but these pieces feel like a stitched-together afterthought. It never gets the screen time it should because the game spends most of its time obfuscating the truth behind its central ghost story. It presents a truth to the girls' relationship it intends to explore, but then never really does that, making their endpoint together feel unearned and glossed over."
"This element is somewhat improved upon in the game's epilogue. At about 2-3 hours, it's more like a second campaign that further explores the events the girls' experience during their overnight stay at school. This campaign is better designed, as it's set in a single, creepy house with puzzles that are a bit more complicated, as though it builds on what the first campaign taught you even if you're a beginner to the genre. It's also scarier thanks to a new enemy who is harder to avoid, and it all comes together with a more robust, cohesive story than the primary campaign. It's only unlocked when you beat the main game, so you'll never see it first, but that makes it a stronger outro for Cozy Game Pals, the tiny studio making its debut with Fear The Spotlight."
"This campaign happens to be the bulk of the work that the team did in the last year, after Fear The Spotlight was pulled from Steam so the team could enhance it, presumably as part of the publishing deal with Blumhouse. It winds up being a wise choice, as this second act is the game's better, more memorable one and even retroactively improves the first campaign in some ways. Together, they tell a more complete and compelling story, even as this second campaign does most of the heavy lifting."
"Though I don't often love a retro aesthetic, I've found I'm much more into it in horror games--maybe that's my nostalgia talking--and Fear The Spotlight stands out well in this way. This is partly because it's not entirely faithful to the PS1 look it adopts. With lots more voice acting than true original PlayStation games and the over-the-shoulder presentation, it feels more like a demake of a modern game than something authentically capturing the era its sharply polygonal characters imply. The school looks great in this style, and it's clear the team has played and enjoyed Silent Hill, as some of its locations look rusty and hollowed-out like the Otherworld realm frequented in Konami's trailblazing series."
"Fear The Spotlight is far from the scariest game you could play this Halloween season, but what may be read as a detriment for some is instead its best quality for others. With classically designed but more contained puzzles and combat-free monster encounters, it's a game that utilizes genre touchstones in manners meant to onboard new and/or younger players. Mechanically, it's simple, and the story doesn't come together until you've unlocked and finished the second campaign, but its combination of old and new horror-game design elements makes it a creepy and clever introduction to what is my favorite genre, and what may prove to be yours, too."
"If you've already played Sonic Generations, you know what you're getting with the first half of this package. Sonic's adventure remains largely unchanged--most notably, the visuals are better, since this is a remaster--seeing the blue hedgehog team up with his past self to speed through a collection of levels inspired by his many previous adventures. Each level has two acts--the first sees past Sonic race through 2D levels while the second features modern-day Sonic running through the same space but now in 3D. Past Sonic handles much like he did in the original games back in the '90s, while modern Sonic utilizes the mechanics added to the series during the 2000s, like the homing attack and dash. The whole collection is a celebration of Sonic's career up to 2011."
"In 2024, Sonic Generations feels outdated. While the old-school Sonic levels remain a timeless look back at the hedgehog's origins, the second half no longer feels like an accurate presentation of modern-day Sonic, as the gameplay of the franchise has continued to transform over the past decade. This doesn't outright ruin the original experience, though it does leave the conclusion of Sonic Generations feeling lacking, as if the trip through Sonic's greatest hits abruptly stops partway through. It leaves the three-hour experience feeling rushed in a way it didn't back in 2011."
"The main draw of Sonic X Shadow Generations, however, is the Shadow Generations half of the game. This is the part of the game that's brand-new, acting as an accompanying story to Sonic Generations. Shadow Generations follows Shadow the Hedgehog, concluding the arc of his story that started in 2001's Sonic Adventure 2 and then continued in 2003's Sonic Heroes, 2005's Shadow the Hedgehog, and 2006's Sonic the Hedgehog. The thread was largely dropped from the Sonic franchise and hasn't been revisited in any significant way since."
"Still suffering from amnesia and seeking answers as to his origins and purpose as the ultimate life form, Shadow is pulled into the same timeless space his friends were during the events of Sonic Generations, where threats from Shadow's past still exist. Notably, Black Doom, the satanic alien warlord responsible for Shadow's creation, returns after his death at the hands of Shadow during the events of Shadow the Hedgehog. A part of Black Doom lives on in Shadow and wants the hedgehog to relive significant moments of his life--in doing so, he'll remember who he is and unlock Doom powers. Once Shadow fully embraces these abilities, he'll truly be the ultimate life form and Black Doom will take over his body, allowing him to live again. Shadow plays along, unlocking new Doom powers in hopes of becoming strong enough to destroy Black Doom for good."
"It's a fine enough conclusion for a storyline that many Sonic fans might have forgotten about (or perhaps weren't even alive for, given the last chapter of this tale occurred in a game from 2006) but Sonic games have rarely been remembered for their stories. If anything, much like Sonic Generations did for Sonic, Shadow Generations' story is a great opportunity to revisit some of Shadow's most memorable moments as well as past boss battles against other artificial beings that could be considered rivals to the title of ""ultimate life form,"" like the Biolizard from Sonic Adventure 2. I was grinning like a kid again when Shadow faced off against Metal Overlord and Crush 40's ""What I'm Made Of..."" started playing, reminding me of the hours I lost to Sonic Heroes when I was 10 years old."
"If you look beyond the layer of nostalgia, your mileage when it comes to Shadow Generations will vary. If Sonic games from the 2000s were some of your favorite games, you'll enjoy Shadow Generations. But if your taste in platformers skews towards more modern sensibilities, Shadow Generations doesn't offer anything new or noteworthy that you wouldn't have already seen done better in other games."
"The game builds on established Sonic mechanics by giving Shadow a Chaos Emerald from the jump, allowing him to use Chaos Control and freeze time for a few brief seconds, slowing approaching enemies before they surround Shadow or stopping moving platforms long enough for him to jump between them. He can also use Chaos Spear to stun otherwise invincible enemies or hit far-off switches. In both cases, these abilities add to the experience of playing a Sonic game, creating room for more types of rudimentary puzzles that don't affect the flow of racing through a stage. They both help maintain a sense of speed from start to finish while also adding a bit of tension to the largely linear levels by testing you on your timing."
"Alongside Chaos Control and Chaos Spear, Shadow will unlock new Doom powers over time that aid how he can get around. Perhaps the most interesting of the lot is a skill that lets Shadow knock a specific enemy type far into the distance and then teleport to the hapless victim to hit them again, acting more as a means of traversal than combat. In a few cases, Shadow has options as to where he can knock an enemy, allowing you to have some agency in where you go next to complete a level. This very rarely occurs, but whenever it pops up, it makes me want to replay the mission again if only to see if one of the other choices would have allowed me to complete the stage faster."
"Most of Shadow's new abilities aren't as much fun to play with, however. Shadow eventually unlocks a skill that lets him transform into a gooey slug-like creature to swim through muck and Spider-Man swing from globules of slime--it's weird and awkward and ruins the sense of speed every time, and it frequently pops up as a mandatory part of progressing in a stage. Worse is an endgame Doom ability that's especially clunky and difficult to use, forcing you to control Shadow at speeds that are a tad too fast and can see you regularly careen over a stage's guard rails and into the abyss, forcing a restart at the last checkpoint. I had many frustrating deaths near the end of the game because of this particular Doom ability, and ultimately only got past the final levels by forcing myself not to use it and awkwardly jump through obstacles in a way the game clearly did not intend me to. In a game built around platforming that revolves around going fast, it's understandable that an ability designed for you to go even faster could be appealing, but when it comes at the cost of going so fast that you then have to course correct and slow things down even more than usual, it feels like said mechanic would have been better off avoided altogether."
"These Doom abilities also feel strangely juxtaposed against the vibe that Shadow Generations is a trip down memory lane for Shadow, as they're skills that Shadow has never had before. In comparison, Sonic Generations features mechanics inspired by Sonic's adventures, like the colorful aliens that gift Sonic's unique abilities from Sonic Colors. Admittedly, if Shadow Generations did the same thing, it would be yet another Sonic video game with the protagonist sundering fools with pistols and assault rifles since one of Shadow's most noteworthy traits is that he's not afraid to shoot people, and I could see the Sonic Team not wanting to go down that path again. But it still feels so out of place to see Shadow utilize abilities we haven't seen him use before when the game is a celebration of Shadow's journey that reminisces on his previous adventures."
"These new abilities have uses within the hub that Shadow returns to between each stage. Here, the abilities feel better, transforming the 3D space into a playground where Shadow's accumulation of Doom traits allows him to explore more and more of the space. With each new ability, you can traverse further, finding collectibles and--more importantly--small challenge levels that you need to complete to earn the keys that unlock the doors to the boss rooms."
"The challenge levels feature an assortment of tasks that require you to make your way through a part of the main stages with a specific restriction or task. A challenge level might require you to beat a level with only one ring, meaning you can only afford one mistake, for example, while another might see you have to reach the goal within a time limit while also defeating a certain number of a specific enemy. They help alleviate what I otherwise would imagine to be a repetitive game, adding interesting skill challenges that shake up the established formula between the main levels."
"Aesthetically, Shadow Generations doesn't have any bad levels, pulling from Shadow's adventures through fantastical locales and sci-fi factories. They're all a visual delight, especially at full speed where their bright colors and careful signposting intuitively guide you forward toward the goal, all in pursuit of getting the fastest time possible. The music is also excellent. Most of Shadow's past adventures featured rock music perfectly suited for the most angsty of teens and, graciously, you can change the music for any one stage to some of these past songs, like ""All Hail Shadow"" or ""I Am...All Of Me."""
"Sonic X Shadow Generations is a weird package. On one hand, Sonic Generations is a remaster of a great game from 2011 that now feels like it's a little outdated. And on the other, Shadow Generations is the conclusion to a storyline that the franchise hasn't really cared about since 2006. As someone who specifically got into Sonic games during that early 2000 period, this collection feels like it speaks directly to me. But it also feels much like its protagonists--lost in a place out of time and desperate to return to fonder times. It's a nice enough trip down memory lane, but the trip features all the speed bumps you'd expect from games from that era."
"Horror games based on beloved movies are more popular than ever, even when you compare this era to the early Nintendo years when movie tie-ins were a lot more common. But most of these modern takes on famous horror monsters have gone in the same direction, for better or worse. While everyone else is offering asymmetrical horror multiplayer games, RetroRealms turns back the clock to offer a package more in line with those horror tie-ins of decades ago, and thanks to some charming nods to horror history and pixel-perfect platforming, it's an uncommon and intriguing ode to the horror genre."
"As a product, RetroRealms is sold in a peculiar manner. RetroRealms Arcade is itself a free 3D hub space that you can explore in first-person, combining touches of a classic arcade with a horror museum. Within that space, you can purchase one or both 2D 16-bit platformers available at launch, Halloween and Ash vs. Evil Dead (AVED). For this review, I've played both games and used all current characters available."
"Like Dead By Daylight, RetroRealms uses the idea of a demonic Big Bad, The Overlord, to bring its otherwise disparate worlds into one multiverse. The villain's goal is a bit unclear and the story in general isn't trying to be more than set dressing, with each playable character getting their own McGuffin to chase through any of the game's multiple campaigns. The simple conceit paves the way to let you run through elaborate levels as Michael Myers, Ash Williams, and--if you buy additional character DLC--Laurie Strode from Halloween and Kelly Maxwell from AVED."
"Because the game is a collaboration between Boss Team Games, a studio I recently learned is fully committed to licensed horror adaptations, and Wayforward, one of the best 2D game studios going today, RetroRealms shines in ways that exemplify what each team brings to the table. In the former's case, this is expressed through the game's explorable hub where you can unlock 3D versions of items seen in the game's multiple campaigns, like Michael's famous blue jumpsuit or his even more iconic mask. There are also several developer diaries you can unlock and watch, which I found appealing, though usually I wanted them to go longer or be more numerous. A cool one available right away goes into detail on how the game reimagined Halloween's theme song--perhaps the most famous horror theme in movie history--for a retro-style video game."
"Decisions like that, which allow the team to pull back the curtain and show players how things came to be, make for great rewards. Even the props in the museum, though they don't do anything but look cool in their cases, are desirable collectibles to chase. Filling out the entire museum isn't a feat I've yet accomplished, but it's something I'm compelled to do as a big horror fan. I think there's room to do more with these features, and given the teams' intent to make RetroRealms a dynamic platform--at least two more horror franchises are coming to the game in the future, Boss Team told me--hopefully they're expanded on to be even more interesting and numerous."
"While the 3D hub serves as a constant reminder of the reverence the team has for the genre, the real star of this new horror multiverse is the platforming gameplay. Wayforward's expertise shines in every corner of its levels, with vibrant pixel art full of details in the background and foreground, as well as tight traversal and combat mechanics that consistently challenged me."
"Enemies fill every level high and low, and they each display obvious attack patterns that are nonetheless difficult to avoid. Some may throw a propane tank into the air roughly every three seconds, so you quickly learn to time your advance, but just ahead is a gross eyeball shooting sludge horizontally at you, while a platform nearby that you need to progress onward or use to grab an optional collectible overhead is rising and falling at such a speed that maneuvering through all obstacles and landing on it takes patience and perfection. But it's all executable thanks to responsive and nuanced controls, like a jump ability that subtly extends your leap based on how long you hold the button down."
"Across the board, the game's animations are instructive as you learn to duck, ground-pound, and, most importantly due to its invincibility frames, dodge-roll like you're the horror legends' personal dance instructor. You'll take note of how an overheard or ducked melee attack is slightly faster than a standing horizontal stab, which helps take down trains of enemies more quickly and without taking damage yourself. You'll learn exactly how much distance you can cover with an air dash, or for how long you can hang on the side of a wall before you must launch yourself off of it. Every frame of the game matters. It's all done with intent, and utilizing these subtle differences is often the deciding factor between success and failure."
"Players who have longed for arcade experiences that are unforgiving but mechanically reliable will find a gem in RetroRealms. I died frequently, especially early on, but I never felt like the game was being unfair to me--it's often ruthless, but it's never cheating. I expect to enjoy watching high-level players take on these campaigns just as much as playing them myself."
"Those tight mechanics are deepened further thanks to how each character has their own moves and abilities. Playing as Michael Myers, for example, isn't going to feel the same as playing it as Ash Williams or Laurie Strode, even when the game allows you to bring them to each other's worlds to see its multiple campaigns through new lenses. They may all be able to clear the gaps of the same size, but Michael does it with a single leap, while Laurie uses a double-jump ability, for example. Their skill trees further separate them, as you can create different builds, like one character that is especially hearty when it comes to health, allowing them to fight at close range, versus another who is loaded up with plenty of ammo for their ranged attack."
"This will particularly appeal to the game's speedrunning community that's certain to arrive once it's available, as different combinations of levels, characters, and abilities will surely be researched by players seeking to find the optimal builds to climb the leaderboards in a manner that harkens back to the arcade days much like the game does as a whole."
"However, I find character progression to be one area where the game could've been less harsh. Upgrades are tied to campaign-specific save slots, not characters. For example, in one campaign, I'd upgraded Michael Myers a lot, giving him more health pips, more ammo for throwable items, and unlocking several skill moves that made combat easier. But when I took Michael into Ash's world, none of those new toys came with him as it was considered a new campaign with a fresh character. This is one way in which the game adheres to a more punishing style from the '90s that doesn't seem vital to the experience. One could argue this keeps the leaderboards purer--I can't speedrun an overpowered character on the first try; I have to earn a new OP character for a new campaign--but I think the alternative approach, in which you could max-out a character for a grueling challenge elsewhere is more enjoyable and still allows players to compete with the same rules governing all of them."
"Similar to how characters are more than just skins, levels include an added layer that makes the game better. At any point, players can switch from the more earthly version of a level to the Dark Realm. The change is instantaneous and essentially makes every level behave like two levels. You can't stay in the Dark Realm forever--an upgradeable timer ticks away and then demands a brief cooldown when it reverts you to the natural world--but you'd not want to stay in that realm forever anyway. As hard as the base levels can be, the Dark Realm is often harder, with more and heartier enemies who take more than the standard single hit to die."
"Sometimes it's vital to enter the Dark Realm, like when a blockage in the normal world disappears in favor of a fleshy, gross passageway in the Dark Realm. Other times, you may only want to visit it to check for collectibles, like tickets you use to buy items in the hub's 3D museum. Flashing from one world into the other adds a layer of skill to a game already full of skill checks. It's things like this that highlight how talented Wayforward is. The levels are great without this touch, but the team goes to the extreme to add depth, giving some mechanics the air of a victory lap from a team making it look easy."
"Like the character progression, the game's levels do exhibit one especially unforgiving element. Though checkpoints for when you fall off screen are fairly abundant, losing all your life resets the entire level back to the start. A popular modern convenience many games use is simply not to do this to players, and to allow a more generous checkpoint system that I've found to be the right approach. RetroRealms chooses to lean toward the old way of doing things, and that sometimes led me to take breaks from the game rather than fill me with the urge to give it the classic ""one more try."""
"Levels aren't very long, but if you want to be careful and find all collectibles, they can stretch to 10 or 15 minutes each, so to wipe all of that in a game that is already quite hard often feels too taxing. Again, this seems like it's designed with leaderboard purity at heart, but in that case, I think a compromise could be found in which players who use checkpoints don't make it on the leaderboards but can still progress through the campaign."
"Thankfully there's a checkpoint before all boss battles, which are also quite challenging, though even then, if you're struggling and wish to come back to the game later to try again, you'll lose all level progress when you close the game. This isn't a big deal on Xbox where the platform's Quick Resume feature could bail you out, but on other platforms, you'll more likely have to choose between keeping this checkpoint intact or playing something else when you feel like it."
"A few retro-inspired design choices aside, it's a great game overall, and the audiovisual experience is the blood-red cherry on top. Though none of the campaigns are truly retelling stories from their respective properties, the characters look so cool and well-realized--Ash even comes with Bruce Campbell's crucial likeness--and each character is complete with diverse and sometimes funny idle animations. The worlds they inhabit are richly detailed to the point that even the game's best speedrunners ought to slow it down on some runs just to take it all in. Things are always in motion, even when you can find a moment of respite away from all enemies who would do you harm, and the music feels like it arrived from a time machine set to 1994. Though I'm full of '90s nostalgia that doesn't typically extend to video games, RetroRealms blurs the line between being authentically retro and contemporary cool."
"RetroRealms' first two ""cabinets"" arrive in style with excellent platforming gameplay, an authentic '90s vibe, and an interesting first-person 3D wrapper of a hub world that reminds you the game isn't just mechanically tight; it's also horror-obsessed. Boss Team and Wayforward prove to be a compelling tandem with this game, and given the team's intentions to build out its arcade with additional famous (and sometimes masked) faces, I'm hopeful RetroRealms can go the way of the slasher series and get several sequels of its own."
"Mortal Kombat 1's time-twisting campaign ended on a high note, as the introduction of various timelines signaled a wealth of opportunities for future installments. Khaos Reigns is the first DLC expansion on the story, in which a Titan version of the anarchic villain Havik tries to throw Liu Kang's version of the world into his own brand of chaos. The only chaotic force at play here, though, is the storytelling, as this expansion is plagued by rushed story beats and a boring, monotonous structure."
"Khaos Reigns features five chapters--one-third the number in the main campaign--with three of those focusing on the three new roster additions: Cyrax, Sektor, and Noob Saibot. The two chapters between Sektor and Noob follow two main roster characters, Rain and Tanya--albeit in new Emperor and Empress variants, respectively."
"Every one of these chapters plays out the same way: A cutscene eventually bleeds into a pre-fight dialogue, then the fight happens, followed by post-fight dialogue, and repeat. There is no variation to this structure, which means that a story themed around chaos and anarchy instead feels confined and frustratingly rigid. That theme seems like a natural fit for some experimentation, whether that's quick minigames or gauntlet-style matches against multiple opponents, but alas none of that is found here--a point made to feel even more uninspired by the fact that this format is also how the story of the base game played out."
"The cutscenes are hurt by weak dialogue, whether it's lines that sound like they were pulled from a thesaurus--who uses the word ""expeditiously"" over ""quickly""?--or cringe-inducing attempts at banter between Johnny Cage and pretty much any woman that crosses his path. Of course, Cage is supposed to be a pompous, wannabe ladies' man regardless of the timeline, but some of these lines sound so forced, it's hard not to roll one's eyes along with the character to whom he's speaking."
"Another maddening part of Khaos Reigns is how quickly story beats with massive potential are wrapped with little to no conflict. For example, a major deception teased by Bi Han and Sektor is addressed and concluded in the very same chapter, without any real room for the story to breathe. In fact, this argument could be made for the story as a whole, as the Khaos Reigns story ends so abruptly, it could cause whiplash. After chapter upon chapter of being told Titan Havik is a menace, his eventual defeat leaves a lot to be desired."
"These narrative issues are a real shame, too, as the expansion also adds elements to the core game experience that give plenty of new things to discover. Each of the three aforementioned new roster members offers a fun and unique style that thrives on experimentation--Sektor's ordnance and quick-drop attacks make her a formidable foe, while setting off a Cyrax bomb just right for a follow-up combo is incredibly cool every time. Meanwhile, the shadowy, portal-summoning tricks of Noob make him the most interesting character of the three; a few of his combos are jaw-dropping when pulled off correctly."
"There's also a new way to finish off opponents in Animalities, where a character transforms into a wild beast and dispatches their opponent with primal flair. Even among the over-the-top kills seen in normal Fatalities and Brutalities, some of these new Animalities are incredibly gruesome, thanks to the impressively detailed representations of these animals."
"Mileena's mantis transformation is the most harrowing, as watching her chew into her poor opponent's head with a realism that rivals real-world nature inspires equal amounts of smiles and sickness. Others hearken back to Fatalities from previous games, like Noob's double-crocodile Animality, which calls back to one of his Fatalities in Mortal Kombat 9."
"On the other side of the coin, Rain turns into a giant pufferfish and explodes his foe from within in silly fashion, while Peacemaker morphs into a clone of his pal Eagly and the two rain down an American-themed whooping with hilarious results. Finishing moves in modern Mortal Kombat games have always been an exercise in over-the-top evisceration, and have only grown more visceral as technology has advanced. The Animalities on display here might be the best example yet of how far the imagination can go."
"Neither the new roster additions nor the amusing Animalities, however, are enough to overcome the weakness of Khaos Reigns' story expansion. Where the original story of MK1 concluded with a sense of open-endedness, Khaos Reigns instead sets a surprisingly low bar for future narrative elaboration. Titan Havik isn't the only villainous MK character out there, obviously, and perhaps another expansion should one occur will explore another villain's vision for the MK universe, but any future story DLC will suffer from the same fate as this one if the accompanying story is similarly rushed."
"It should be noted that there are three more characters still to come, each of them guests from other IP: Ghostface from Scream, the T-1000 from Terminator, and Conan The Barbarian. All three could add even more variety and fun to the roster after Cyrax, Sektor, and Noob Saibot's strong showings, but they won't be able to cure what ails the story at this point."
"Unfortunately, the excitement of that original Mortal Kombat 1 ending is gone, and in its place rests a trepidation and unease over where the story might go next. Fittingly, it seems this once-promising story has been thrown into, well, chaos."
"After a significant post-GameCube slump, the Mario Party franchise showed signs of new life in its first two titles on the Switch. While both Super Mario Party and Mario Party Superstars were commercial successes and well-received by fans, the former leaned a bit too heavily on a new Ally system while the latter was essentially a ""greatest hits"" of classic maps and minigames. As the console approaches the end of its lifecycle, Super Mario Party Jamboree ends this Switch trilogy by attempting to find the sweet spot between its two predecessors and stumbles into an issue of quantity over quality in the process."
"One aspect that Jamboree inarguably has going for it is sheer quantity. Nintendo touts this entry as having the most playable characters (22) and most minigames (112) in any Mario Party ever. A big roster isn't necessarily a bad thing, although I have one nitpicky complaint about Bowser's inclusion. I've got no beef with the man—he's been a playable mainstay since the SNES after all—it's just the fact that him being playable means that the ""Bowser"" that appears as the antagonist throughout the maps and modes is constantly referred to as ""Imposter Bowser,"" which feels a little hamfisted and unnecessary. Just take him off the playable roster or have some new placeholder villain, we don't need a fake Bowser with spooky purple lines and PlayStation symbols surrounding his body all the time."
"With that important complaint out of the way, let's get to the party. It's been a while since we've been treated to great original maps. Super Mario Party's were lackluster, and Mario Party Superstars featured five solid ones but they were all from the Nintendo 64 era. Jamboree's offerings are a satisfying mix of five new maps and two returning favorites. The five new maps are better than Super Mario Party's offerings, with the standouts being Roll 'em Raceway and Rainbow Galleria. Only two retro maps made their way in, but I'm very happy with the returning Mario's Rainbow Castle (the first Mario Party map) and Western Land (from Mario Party 2)."
"Each new map has a gimmick, of course. Mega Wiggler's Tree Party features the perpetually sleeping-or-pissed-off Wiggler in the center, and you can ring a bell to move him around and create new paths. Goomba Lagoon surrounds a volcano that erupts and creates dangerous spots, as well as a tide that ebbs and flows to obscure parts of the board. Roll 'em Raceway puts your characters into race cars, which could trigger some Mario Party 9 and 10 flashbacks but it's actually done well this time. Rainbow Galleria is a three-story mall that has you going up and down escalators and collecting stamps for coin rewards. King Bowser's Keep (manned by the aforementioned and stupid Imposter Bowser) has players navigating perilous conveyor belts and attempting to open a vault of potential riches. The two retro maps feature minor tweaks and changes, but are mostly prettier versions of the classic maps you remember."
"Games in the traditional party mode will feel familiar to anyone who has ever played the series. You'll pick your characters, set the turn count, and get to collecting coins in the effort to gain more stars than the others. You know…Mario Party. There are a couple nice changes and additions--like the timeline at the bottom of the screen that lets you know the order of turns and board events--but the biggest tweak to the usual format lies in the Jamboree Buddies and Showdown Minigames."
"Jamboree Buddies are characters from the series that will appear on the board at various points during a game. If you can get to them in time (they disappear after a few turns), you'll trigger a Showdown Minigame for everyone in which the winner gets the Jamboree Buddy's company for the next several turns. These minigames are significantly longer and more involved than the traditional ones. Wario puts the players through a lengthy game show segment, Mario presents a three-game gauntlet composed of standard minigames, and Donkey Kong triggers a bongo-based rhythm game that gives each player time for their own solo. Some are a lot of fun, like Yoshi's platforming race or Daisy's coin-collecting challenge. Others tend to drag and go on far longer than you'd expect. Between these Showdown Minigames, duel games, versus minigames, item games, and more, that 10-turn game you selected might feel more like 20+ turns by the time you're done."
"If you win the Jamboree Buddy's company, benefits can range from inconsequential to game-changing. DK can launch you to random spots on the board, Luigi helps you roll bigger numbers, and Bowser Jr. can set traps for your enemies, for example. But the biggest potential boon is their ability to let you purchase two stars at one time. If you've got 40 coins and you happen to reach a star space in the few turns that your Jamboree Buddy is with you, you can shift the leaderboard very quickly. If another player passes you on the board at any point, however, that Jamboree Buddy will jump ship to their side. It's ultimately a better and more intentionally limited system than the omnipresent ally feature in Super Mario Party, in which your sometimes multiple allies could give you an unfair advantage in dice rolls and minigames for the duration of a game."
"Super Mario Party Jamboree has the unenviable task of following Superstars, a game composed of the best minigames throughout the entire series. Ultimately, the quality difference is noticeable. Most of the new minigames are fine at best, with some standouts like Slappy Go Round, Prime Cut, and Unfriendly Flying Object. But for every genuine crowd-pleaser, there's one that would make me groan when it popped up. Gate Key-pers is my least favorite, featuring five keys and three locked gates. Players laboriously rotate through turns as they randomly use keys on doors and try to memorize which combinations were already attempted. It takes forever and really slows down the pacing, which is something numerous minigames are guilty of this time around. More than one minigame also features the mechanic of ""pick one of these things and hope no one else picks the same one or it doesn't count,"" which has never been fun even once. I expect a certain amount of nonsense and randomness in a Mario Party game, but Jamboree feels like it's leaning too far into it at times."
"A few games in, I started wondering why I was seeing so many repeat minigames. After all, Nintendo touted Jamboree having the most ever, right? It wasn't until I played all of the modes that I realized what was going on here. Sure, there are 112 minigames, but almost 50 of them are exclusive to side modes that you might play once or twice and be done with. So that 112 is almost halved if you're spending most of your time in the party mode, which is what I assume most players will want to do."
"From a hot air balloon that hovers over the various islands of Jamboree, you can select between the other modes. Those range from ""decent distraction"" to ""why did they include this?"". Three waggle-based modes lie on Motion Island. Paratroopa Flight School feels like a bad Wii experiment. It has you and an optional second player flapping your Joy-Con-wielding arms to soar around the map to collect coins and Para-biddybuds or participate in a wonky Crazy Taxi-like delivery game. It is not fun. Rhythm Kitchen supports up to four local players, and offers some genuinely fun minigames based on cooking and rhythm, but wrapped in a vaguely-scored chef battle format. I really wish the minigame ideas from Rhythm Kitchen had been incorporated into the standard party pool, as there are some good ones in here but this mode will not be getting a lot of play in my house. Toad's Item Factory feels like an early iPhone game and has you tilting and rotating your Joy-Cons in an effort to guide a ball into a hole. I'd imagine most people will play this once, and I'd have greatly preferred a handful of new minigames in the party mode instead of this addition."
"A real eyebrow-raising tease in the trailers for Jamboree was the mention of a mode that supports 20 players. That would be the Koopathlon, which puts 20 live players (or bots, depending on how full your game is) on a race track. You advance by collecting coins in various minigames, all of which are exclusive to this mode. These are lengthier than your usual minigames and are frequently repeated. By the third time you're taking rolls out of the oven before they overcook, the thrill of racing 19 other players is diminished significantly. There's a kernel of a great idea here--Mario Party has room for a mode that features tons of players and big minigames that take inspiration from Fall Guys or the battle royale genre, but this doesn't feel fully baked."
"Bowser Kaboom Squad is another online mode that lets you party up with seven of your friends to take on a CPU-controlled Imposter Bowser. Its minigames are unique in that they feature eight players in a co-op environment. You'll work together to arrange cards in order or stop Bob-Ombs from destroying a castle gate, and these games can be hectic fun in the vein of Overcooked. Only 10 minigames are present in this mode, and when you're not participating in one, you're running around a map collecting bombs to launch at Imposter Bowser. If you perform well in the minigames, your team will be granted helpful items like gloves to carry more bombs or dash pads to deliver bombs to the cannon faster. It's fun if you get a group together, but I really can't imagine how often people are going to be calling up seven friends for a round of Bowser Kaboom Squad."
"The modes don't end there. Minigame Island features numerous ways to play the full assortment of minigames, including free play, a daily challenge, and a playlist of only Showdown Minigames. Party Planner Trek is a single-player mode that has you completing tasks, playing minigames against CPU opponents, and collecting mini-stars as you explore the five new maps."
"A lot of this ends up feeling like bloat. Having more modes can be a good thing, but I feel like the amount of mode-exclusive minigames encroaches on how much I enjoyed the core party mode. It's like Nintendo wanted to cram as much in to make this a fun experience even if you're solo or have only one friend over, but Mario Party has always thrived when it's you in a room with three buddies. There are so many great solo and two-player experiences across every console. That's not what I'm looking for in Mario Party. Plenty of fun ideas are present in each mode, but if they were incorporated into the main party mode I feel like this would be a much more appealing total package."
"Some of the moves they've made to increase longevity are appreciated. As you play you'll accumulate Party Points which you can spend on an expanding assortment of stickers, music tracks, and reactions. There's even a Battle Pass-like system (don't worry, you can't spend money on it) that has you unlocking new rewards as you rank up your player level."
"In a surprising move, Jamboree also introduces a Pro Rules option to the base party mode. I expected this to be a toggle that simply turned off rubberbanding, but it's actually more complex than that. It attempts to remove some randomness from the chaos by announcing the (one) bonus star at the start, allowing players to choose an item to begin with, limiting shop items, and placing signs around the map that determine possible next locations for the star space. It removes several random elements--you won't find Chance Time or hidden blocks here, and minigames are voted on out of a limited selection like in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe online."
"It's an interesting idea, but it really doesn't strip the luck elements out of the Mario Party experience at all. At one point near the end of a Pro Rules game on King Bowser's Keep, I had 130 coins and no stars. Imposter Bowser covered the map in Bowser Spaces and I landed on one. Pro Rules dictate that if you land on one, you lose a star. Since I had none, he opted to take all 130 coins from me. So even in Pro Rules, you can be completely screwed beyond your control with the random roll of a dice. And with no Chance Time spaces or hidden blocks, the chances of an exciting last-minute change of fortune are effectively zero. At that point you're just rolling the dice and limply participating in minigames as you wait for the game to end, which isn't fun at all."
"Many new elements are attempted in Super Mario Party Jamboree, and unfortunately I feel like a lot of them are unwelcome. The new modes are largely duds, the tantalizing promise of 20-player online falls a bit flat, and several of the new minigames are a slog. That said, the new maps are the best original ones in many years and Jamboree promises to still be a blast when you've got some friends over. I've reviewed many Mario Party games over the years and it's always a weird series to assign a number to. During the review period you get to play the occasional online session with Nintendo reps and fellow games media members, but a lot of time is spent exploring the maps and minigames solo. In this form, the faults of the game are laid bare and you see it with clear eyes. But once you grab a few close friends and you're laughing with it over a few beers, the deeply flawed game turns into a raucous night of camaraderie and laughter. Jamboree is no more or less nonsense than any Mario Party, and it's one I'll still be playing a ton of despite its flaws."
"It's the bottom of the ninth in the fifth and final game of the Super Ultra Championship of the Universe Series. My Mighty Monsters are trailing by two runs and down to their final out. Kenny Kawaguchi, the league's best pitcher coming off a record-setting season for strikeouts, is at the plate. No one would doubt his repertoire at the mound, but his strength has never been in the batter's box. With runners on first and third, the count goes full--could it be any more dramatic? The 3-2 pitch screeches inside, but Kenny makes great contact. Incredibly, the ball is launched. The kid only had four homers all year, but this one could count for much more. It's high enough if it's got the velocity. Back, back, back… gone! The Monsters win! A walk-off three-run blast from the team's pitcher sends the squad of neighborhood pals into the history books of the Backyard Baseball League. Do you believe in miracles?"
"My true story of sports heroics took place roughly 24 years ago on one of those colorful Mac computers many had in the late '90s and early aughts. Backyard Baseball, once handed out merely as the prize inside a cereal box, would go on to become an institution in the lives of Millennial kids everywhere, and if you're around my age, you might have some nostalgia for it yourself. Over a quarter-century since the game first debuted, Backyard Baseball '97, as it's now officially called, has debuted on Steam--where shady download links and eBay price gougers can't hurt you. It's been great to discover the game still holds up, even as it's also very obvious that I am no longer the target audience."
"Backyard Baseball '97 is a re-release of the original game that kicked off the Backyard Sports series. Under new rights-holders, the plan is to bring back several games lost to time, eventually paving the way for a Backyard Sports multimedia universe. With such grand plans for the future, the first release of the bunch has thankfully turned out great, and could feasibly serve as the series' grand re-opening. It's said that the game is remastered, though I can't see how. Every inch of it looks identical, not just to my spotty memory, but also when I compare it to gameplay videos online."
"The colorful 2D sports game stars a roster of 30 diverse kids, each of them with their own attributes, voice acting, theme song, nickname, bio, and personality. It's these kids, even more than the solid beginner-friendly baseball mechanics, that make Backyard Baseball timeless. You could poll any number of former fans, and every last one of them would be able to tell you about their favorite characters and the memories they have of them."
"There's Pete Wheeler, the not-so-bright speedster who can steal any base--provided he knows which way to run. There's Keisha Phillips, a towering young girl with an affinity for telling jokes and hitting dingers. There's the Webber twins, Sidney and Ashley, who come from the rich side of town but aren't afraid to mix it up on the diamond with kids from other walks of life, so long as they're on each other's team. There's Achmed Khan, a music-obsessed kid who plays every game with headphones on, and his little brother Amir, who looks up to Achmed in such an endearing, little-brother way."
"Of course, the most unforgettable of them all is Pablo Sanchez, nicknamed The Secret Weapon. In reality, he's sports' worst-kept secret. There's nothing he can't do, and even as the games were hard to obtain in recent years, the legend of Pablo has been revisited many times, with real-life athletes paying tribute to him in different ways. Virtually every team starts with Pablo, but each and every one of the kids is well-written and feels like a fully realized character; they're all charming in their own ways."
"That focus on personality and leaning into the magic of childhood continues onto the various fields themselves. There are several different parks you'll play at, each of them capturing the make-do spirit of neighborhood kids putting a team or league together. There's Tin Can Alley, with its defense-friendly high walls and short outfield due to things like a dumpster and truck container getting in the way. Sandy Flats is played on a beach, with an outfield ""wall"" made from a windswept fence in the sand. A few of the kids' own backyards are settings for games, like Ernie's Steele Stadium, where homers land in the neighbor's pool, and Kimmy's Eckman Acres, complete with professional landscaping surely paid for by her parents."
"Each setting feels like it could be the scene in a similarly styled cartoon, like Hey Arnold or Recess, and playing the games themselves continues this vibrant and youthful spirit. A commentary crew consisting of uber-professional Sunny Day and comically bookie-coded Vinny The Gooch talks you through each game, relating scoring plays to nabbing Halloween candy and commenting on the game's special pitches, like a Slo-Mo ball that cartoonishly defies Newtonian physics."
"Everything is recontextualized for a kid's-eye-view of the world. Between at-bats that come to life with earworms in the form of walk-up theme songs, players also constantly chirp phrases at one another, such as, ""We want a batter, not a broken ladder!"" The field is never quiet, just like it in real life whenever a group of kids gets together. Each inning sounds like a sugar rush and looks like a weekend with friends. There's magic in the air."
"More than anything else, Backyard Baseball owes its timelessness to these qualities. It's a colorful world that feels familiar and relatable but also presents a richly detailed alternate universe where every character is someone's favorite and every game is fun to play. In 2024, Backyard Baseball '97 remains overstuffed with personality. I used to speculate part of the reason these games disappeared is because in later sequels they began to seek out licenses from leagues and players' unions, such as the MLB and MLBPA, which perhaps became prohibitively priced. Newer games included several pro players, like Randy Johnson and David Ortiz to help sell the game, and I thought maybe the creators saw this feature as non-negotiable. But I never cared for those players anyway; I always wanted the original Backyard kids. They're the true stars of this series."
"Solid baseball gameplay mechanics aid the memorable people and places of the game despite a novel control setup. Backyard Baseball uses point-and-click mechanics not unlike the other titles in the library belonging to the game's original publisher, Humongous Entertainment. It may sound odd for a sports game, but it works well. Pitching and batting come down to placement and timing on both sides of that exchange, and different levels of on-screen help can make batting, in particular, easier to do, like pitch-locator UI elements that help you line up your swings better."
"On the field, you simply click where you want your players to go, and the one nearest to where you've clicked will move there to meet the ball's can't-miss shadow, allowing you to perform feats like turning a double play or catching a fly ball. Players will tag up and try to score after you've caught a fly in the outfield, and though you can't attempt baserunner pick-offs, staffing a solid catcher can mean the difference between preventing a stolen base or letting them slide safely into second."
"Errors can still occur, so it's important not to put a kid with lesser fielding attributes in a high-volume position like shortstop or center field, and by playing with your kids a lot, you may come to find where they best fit, after which point you can adjust their spot on the field or in the starting nine easily in the pause menu. I like having Pete and Pablo in the outfield because they're so fast, while Stephanie Morgan basically demands to play shortstop--and that's fine with me, since she's great at it."
The game's simple controls make learning easy for kids or anyone who doesn't usually play games. I have fond memories of when I was younger and Backyard Baseball actually inspired my dad to make a team and play through a season too--and he's essentially never played video games in his life.
"However, given that I do play games and I'm no longer a kid playing this at the turn of the millennium, it's clear that I've passed the game by in some important ways, too. It's a children's game, and a great one at that, but even on the game's hardest settings--in which I've fully upped the difficulty, removed the pitch-locator tools, and have even consciously chosen to ignore power-ups like an aluminum bat that guarantees a home run, or a scorching fireball that is effectively too fast to hit, the game sadly doesn't present a challenge anymore."
"My first game was tough for a few innings, and up until the fourth inning, I had only five hits as a team in a scoreless game. But then my batters came alive and I ended up beating the CPU 22-0. Future games in my march toward championship glory unfolded similarly. It was like it took me a few at-bats to re-find my timing, and once I found it, the game's stakes were sent to the dugout. As I began to apply self-imposed restrictions, score differentials were reduced, but I never felt threatened in a way that provided the compelling drama of my first championship a quarter-century ago."
"This isn't exactly a flaw of the game; it's clearly designed for kids. However, in reviving the project, the team chose not to tweak anything despite knowing the nostalgic series would surely bring adult fans back. There's a purity argument I'm sympathetic to in this case--game preservationists will enjoy that the game is identical to how it was before--but that means many won't be challenged enough to stick around for long. In that case, such fans are almost better off waiting for Backyard Productions--the new rights holders with multimedia intentions--to bring the game's awesome characters to life via a TV show or, perhaps, a totally new game with a higher difficulty bar for those who want it."
"With only pick-up games and a season mode on offer, the game also seems to miss an opportunity to do things like add multiplayer, co-op, or other modes that modern technology allows. My hope is a modding community can spring from this re-launch, and perhaps the new studio behind the series is even banking on that, too."
"A ""remaster"" of this game more in line with the usual meaning of the word feasibly would've included quality-of-life updates. Yet, Backyard Baseball '97 seems not to have given any attention to that part of the game. One of its greatest exploits always was and remains an ability to fool CPU baserunners into advancing when they shouldn't. For example, if a CPU baserunner safely hits a single, rather than throw the ball to the pitcher and invite the next batter into the box, you can simply throw the ball to another infielder or two. Before long, the CPU will misjudge this as an opportunity to advance, letting you easily catch them in a pickle."
"You can do this as many times as you want to; you always could, and you still can in this new Steam version of the game. Much like the way I had to consciously opt out of using power-ups on offense or defense to make the game a bit harder for myself, players of all ages will have to find their own moral fiber and not resort to cheesing the CPU just because doing so might be convenient when trying to win a game. Not everyone knows this trick, but for those who discover it, it's like returning a lost wallet to its owner; it falls on you to do what's right."
"Still, if that's a parents-and-kids teaching moment waiting to happen, then it's one of many this game offers, and that's usually a great thing. The game is a fantastic experience for young players overall, and having their parents, siblings, or other loved ones right there beside them, perhaps teaching them video games, baseball, or both, feels like a setting conducive to new magic being conjured with this roster of diverse characters and the sports league they're obsessed with."
"I once enjoyed the game as a player, back when I was in the middle of the game's target audience. Today, I'm well outside of that, but the game has taken on new meaning to me now that I have kids of my own. Because the core gameplay remains fun and easy to learn, passing down my favorite characters to my kids has been a heartwarming joy, and watching their favorites emerge has been exciting. I can't really play this game competitively anymore; I've outgrown it in that sense. But I could never outgrow these vibrant kids that helped shape my childhood, and I'm confident other parents, whether they grew up with the game or not, will sense a similar magic when they play it with their kids, too."
"Unlike the contentious launch of its predecessor, Diablo 4 arrived last year with a reasonably strong foundation that Blizzard has nurtured thoughtfully in the months since, giving its first expansion much less heavy lifting to do in the hearts and minds department. Diablo 4 doesn't necessarily require an overhaul, but that's what it feels like it's getting next to its biggest content addition yet. That means you don't have to own Vessel of Hatred to enjoy some of the most exciting changes arriving alongside it, but without it you would be missing out on the game's most dynamic class yet, which makes Vessel of Hatred a blast to play."
"If you've been away from Diablo 4 for sometime then you'll be happy to know that Vessel of Hatred isn't designed solely for those who have stayed engaged in demon-slaying since launch last year. If you want to hop right into the campaign of the expansion, you're given the option to do so with a new character from the start, so long as you've completed at least the prologue in the base game. The updates since Diablo 4's launch coupled with the sweeping changes made by a far-reaching update that goes live with the expansion enables this approach, making leveling substantially faster to get you to endgame activities by the end of Vessel of Hatred's campaign. The changes to difficulty also remove any tedious grinding, letting you select your preferred difficulty and having all areas and enemies scale accordingly. These, along with more subtle changes to damage, health, and resource figures, as well as the lower level cap, all make Diablo 4 feel fresh again. That's especially true if you haven't been keeping up to date with it over the past year."
"Vessel of Hatred's story picks up after the events of Diablo 4, an indeterminate amount of time after Lilith's defeat and the subsequent imprisonment of her father, Mephisto. Neyrelle, one of your core companions, has been shepherding Mephisto with her and bearing the brunt of his mind-twisting torture, venturing deep into the new region on Nahantu in search of a prison that might hold him. Meanwhile, the Cathedral of Light has its own crisis of faith thanks to a misguided campaign into hell and a new leader who is all about punishment over redemption, threatening its very existence in the wake of many of its followers perishing. This establishes a dual-antagonist threat, one with the Cathedral pursuing Neyrelle to pin its failures on, and the other with the growing power of the Prime Evil she's carrying. Yet despite this, both of Vessel of Hatred's main villains feature surprisingly little during its campaign, only manifesting once you're ready to vanquish them. This stands in contrast to the persistent threat of Lilith in the main Diablo 4 campaign, whose presence was tangible as you raced across the region to put an end to her machinations."
"Vessel of Hatred is a continuation of that story, but Lilith's absence is profound. This isn't helped by a large portion of the campaign acting as a crash course on background for the expansion's new class, the Spiritborn. These ferocious warriors are able to tap into an entirely different realm of reality where the spirits of all beings, both past and present, reside, letting you draw on their power in order to protect this peaceful sanctum. There's a lot of time spent on establishing this new lore and introducing key characters in its legacy, tying them into past events that are meant to give weight to the current conflict. But this comes at the expense of diminishing the higher-stakes conflict unfolding around you, relegating most of its progression to the last few moments of the campaign. It ultimately leads to an unsatisfying ending that requires a surprise twist that feels unearned, setting up the true conflict for the future just as the story finally starts becoming engrossing. It makes Vessel of Hatred feel like an awkward middle chapter to a larger story, being used to mop up loose ends from the first entry while setting up a finale and offering no meaningful story of its own to tell."
"Thankfully, playing as a Spiritborn is anything but a letdown. This new class combines fast and fluid melee combat with the affinities of four different spirit animals: the Eagle, Jaguar, Gorilla, and Centipede. These boil down to different playstyles; Eagle attacks, for example, deal lightning damage and generally stack well with the Vulnerable debuff, while Centipede lets you spread vicious poison damage around groups of foes quickly before letting you burst them down with chained attacks. Initially it's tempting to move through the skill tree focusing on just one affinity, leaning into pure Centipede or Jaguar builds. But once you start mixing them together, it's easy to see just how malleable the Spiritborn really is, giving this class more depth than those that came before it."
"I initially found a lot of fun with the Centipede abilities, particularly ones that turned poison damage into an infection of sorts that would bounce between afflicted foes as they attacked or died. It reminded me a lot of the playstyle I adopted in my early time with Diablo 4's Necromancer, where crowd control was key. Eventually my Spiritborn evolved into using a build that removed Centipede skills entirely and settled on a mix of abilities from Eagle, Jaguar, and Gorilla. Each provided a key pillar to the build, with Eagle's devastating quill attacks forming the foundation of damage dealing, Jaguar's attack-speed buffs letting me deal that damage incredibly quickly, and Gorilla's defensive skill keeping me both alive and free of any debuffs."
"This, in combination with an evasion skill that sometimes seemed like it was doing more damage than anything else, resulted in a fast-moving Spiritborn who could turn large groups of enemies into nothing almost instantly, and held its own in the expansion's many (and delightfully mechanically-varied) boss fights. But I still feel like this is just the tip of the iceberg. There's already a few other entirely new variations I'm excited to try, especially some that work well by leveraging specific gear that can make even basic-attack builds viable again. If you aren't too concerned with Diablo 4's ongoing story and hope that the new class is enough to justify Vessel of Hatred alone, the Spiritborn does so in spades."
"Vessel of Hatred benefits from the many changes that will be free to all Diablo 4 players, especially with regards to how the game has changed to better support single-player. The new difficulty settings that replace the original World Tiers even out progression throughout the entire game to remove some frustrating progression hurdles, while the speed of character leveling has been increased to a more satisfying pace."
"What is exclusive to the expansion, however, is the addition of Mercenaries. After unlocking each one through a small introductory mission, these NPCs will follow you into battle when venturing out alone, bringing distinct abilities to complement your own. You can choose from mercenaries that soak up damage for you and counter potentially fatal damage by crowd-controlling enemies, or choose a more direct damage-dealer to pile on the pressure with you. If you're not playing with other players, you can select a mercenary to venture at your side as well as a second, supporting one (called a reinforcement) who only jumps in when you specify actions. Once you're in a party with other people, you still retain the use of your reinforcement, making your individual mercenary progression matter to a degree irrespective of how you plan to enjoy playing Diablo 4. Their inclusion is more profound, however, when playing alone, and mimics the dynamics of a real party closely to add another aspect of combat to think about."
"In addition to the Spiritborn class and the new region of Nahantu (which measures around the same size of as a single region from the base game), Vessel of Hatred introduces two new ways to rapidly level up your character and engage in new twists on the established dungeon-crawling formula. The first is the Kurast Undercity, which has shades of the Nephalem Rifts introduced in Diablo 3's Reaper of Souls expansion. Each venture into the Undercity is a new run with randomly generated enemies strewn across one of these locales, with each one featuring three floors you need to clear before taking on a boss. The twist here is that each run is time-limited. You're initially given just 100 seconds to play with, with your run ending once the timer expires. Various enemies on each floor can help you extend that time, encouraging you not only to pick targets carefully but also focus on quickly dealing lots of damage. Optional objectives on each floor also contribute to the level of rewards you'll receive on completion, forcing you to balance your time between progressing through each floor and taking risks to increase your bounty at the end."
"This combines into a highly rewarding and engrossing experience, distilling the thrills of clearing a dungeon in a condensed, adrenaline-fueled skirmish. Even when a run didn't go my way, I never felt cheated of my time, especially since loot is rewarded even on failed attempts. As you progress through Vessel of Hatred, you'll obtain items that let you increase the difficulty and add combat modifiers to earn specific types of loot, providing a feeling of freshness while also giving you another outlet for productive grinding."
"The second is the Dark Citadel, a new raid-like activity that provides a weekly incentive to return and attempt some of the hardest challenges Diablo 4 offers. Available only once you've unlocked Torment I, the Dark Citadel isn't necessarily something you'll encounter unless you're the type of player who is invested in spending a lot of time honing your character over hours and hours once you've hit the level cap. It's understandable why this is the case, given that The Dark Citadel is meant to challenge your fundamental understanding of both your build and that of other players, but it's still a pity that it'll likely be an aspect of the expansion that many players don't get to experience as a result."
"This event is split up into three distinct dungeons, with each wing of the citadel featuring various floors of enemies to clear and light puzzles to solve. The dungeons, which require 2-4 players to cooperate through, routinely split players up to achieve objectives independently that determines your progression as a team, meaning each member needs to be able to carry their weight. Boss battles at the end of each wing accentuate this, with these multi-stage skirmishes requiring you to figure out their various puzzle elements and then execute on the solutions with both speed and precision. It's a true test of your understanding of both your character build and how it synergizes with the rest of your party, and is a fine addition to the existing endgame content that has evolved positively since the original release of Diablo 4."
"Vessel of Hatred acts as a great reentry point for lapsed Diablo 4 players looking for another fix of the dungeon-crawling action that the original release so deftly introduced. The Spiritborn class is as satisfying to command in skirmishes as it is to experiment with, featuring a level of depth that extends beyond all classes before it. Both the Kurast Undercity and the Dark Citadel are captivating additions to the existing (and drastically improved) endgame conten. The expansion is only let down by a middling story that fails to captivate on the setup of the base game and ends with nothing more than a tease for the presumably real conflict to come. Irrespective of that, Diablo 4 didn't need an expansion to uplift it, but Vessel of Hatred certainly delivers on making the entire thing feel fresh again."
"Despite several recent successes in remaking classic horror games, there's been one project that seemed to be an enormously daunting, if not impossible, task: Silent Hill 2. For some, the game represents the holy grail of the survival-horror genre, with its uniquely dreamlike mood, haunting monsters draped in metaphor, and an oppressive atmosphere as thick as the titular town's signature fog. Depending on who you ask, Bloober Team has either been auditioning for the reins to this series or liberally cribbing from it for years with games like Layers of Fear and The Medium. Now, in cooperation with Konami, all that groundwork has led to the team's remake of Silent Hill 2, and the end result is a meticulous, loving, and stunning recreation of one of horror's most significant efforts."
"Silent Hill 2 stars James Sunderland, a man who arrives in the dreary town of Silent Hill in search of his wife, Mary, who has written him a letter begging to see him again despite allegedly dying three years ago. For James and the player alike, this classic horror story setup of an amnesiac surrounded by ghouls soon peels away like dead skin, revealing a series of surreal nightmares that blend moods and aesthetics in ways that purposely confound and unsettle. This ultimately gives life to something that may feel familiar to players, if only because the original Silent Hill 2 has been such a prominent genre touchstone for more than two decades."
"The town and its inhabitants behave like the setting and characters of a dream one may half-recall upon waking. Moving through Silent Hill often defies basic concepts of what a town even is, evidenced by the enormous fences cloaked in dirty sheets that abruptly end some avenues. They look as though they exist to quarantine the town from the outside world, but the thick fog envelops so much of the space that it also immediately and ceaselessly feels like no other place possibly exists."
"It's as though Silent Hill is not a place on a map, but a place in one's mind, and the game expertly toys with its lack of clarity in this regard. It ignores Euclidean geometry in favor of decrepit hospitals, labyrinthine apartments, and archaic prisons that, once breached, reveal themselves to be impossibly vast, dark, liminal spaces. James is not welcome there, and as much as any sensible person would turn around and head for the exit, a vaguely felt hand of fate pulls him deeper into the town at every turn."
"Conversations between James and other travelers lost in the fog of the town unfold with a similar air of unreality. The virtual ghost town is home to a sparse few, each of whom seems to have been called to the locale subconsciously, much like James. People say things that couldn't possibly make sense to someone like him, a stranger who has only just arrived, or the player, who is right there with him. But when James seems to accept their words at face value, it has the intended effect of estranging you as the player. It's like inverted dramatic irony, where the characters seem to know something you don't, but they're not hiding it from you maliciously, either."
"You're not meant to understand it much, at least not always, and certainly not right away. Early conversations reveal this strange quality, and before you can determine if you're missing something, the game has pulled you too far into its central mystery to merit an early exit, much like James's own experience."
"All of these phantasmagorical qualities of the town are made even more special by an incredible soundtrack from longtime series composer Akira Yamaoka, who returned for this project along with a few others from the original game. Yamaoka's score is unforgettable, even as it's often deliberately at odds with the events you're seeing on the screen. Some compositions are touching and sweet, but become corrupted and creepy when they're used during darker moments, like when a seemingly orphaned young girl claims to have been friends with Mary, and the growing hostility of her accusations is wonderfully juxtaposed against the tranquility of the music."
"In the remake, Yamaoka has rearranged several of the original game's songs, which are as mesmerizing as they ever were. Having heard the original songs so many times, I noticed some of the differences immediately, but I never found the new versions lacking. There's an ever-present danger in Silent Hill, so when that's upended with legitimately beautiful music, it only further drives home the town's anomalous nature. Like James, it leaves you struggling to grasp your feelings and questioning everything you thought you knew. Feeling haunted shouldn't also feel so delicate, but routinely, Yamaoka strikes this improbable balance, like a siren's song hypnotizing you toward a vicious undertow."
"It may seem long-winded to focus so much on the game's atmosphere, but it's vital to understanding exactly how this remake turned out so well. The mood of Silent Hill 2 was not only intense in 2001; it was one of a kind, and since then, it's often been imitated. Only now, in Bloober Team's remake, has it been duplicated. Whether the team could perform this specific task has been the cause of doubt in some players' minds leading up to this game. It felt unattainable, but Bloober Team has rebottled the magic, and horror fans everywhere are the beneficiaries, whether they expected it or not."
"Beyond just its music, the game's sound design is remarkable, and so much of its tension is owed to that incredible quality. Again, it leaves the world feeling like it's beyond comprehension. The remake moves the perspective away from the original's fixed camera angles in favor of a modern over-the-shoulder view, a change which may have dampened some of its scares if the team wasn't careful. Instead, the environments host a cacophony of inhuman noises, metallic grinding, and subtly soft whispers that lead you to wonder what is around any corner."
"Very often, enemies are there, but sometimes, they aren't. This prevents a formula from ever being relied on. Once, I was tormented by the room-shaking stomps of an unseen beast beyond the reach of my mostly ineffective flashlight as I solved a puzzle, assuming a boss fight would soon follow my solution. In the end, I never met the creature, whatever they were, but it's that build-up of tension I'll remember more fondly than any firefight I could have had."
"Such new experiences are common in the Silent Hill 2 remake. Every inch of the town has been lovingly recreated and, in many cases, expanded upon, but it keeps intact the essence of the original game's unforgettable environments. For those who've already experienced the original Silent Hill 2, you'll find the same major story beats reoccur in the same key locations in this remake. Even the original game's multiple endings return with seemingly identical (and still somewhat vague) requirements for achieving each of them. But just as Bloober Team has built in two new endings, it's also expanded on the town itself. The original game would take new players about eight hours to beat; the remake roughly doubles that. It's much bigger than some may have anticipated, and yet, paradoxically, it still feels faithful."
"A lot of this expansion is done in the game's indoor environments, where Bloober Team seems to feel rightly justified in making things more complex and larger in scale. James's descent toward an unforgettable reveal is both figurative and literal. These places, often fit with bottomless holes, rusted-out mazes, or, in one case, an absurdly long stairwell, are naturally conducive to experimenting with level design in a way the town's early streets aren't. They already defy logic, whereas the town's various roads and buildings, as unreal as they also feel in some ways, still support the facade of a typical town when you're viewing them on a map in the game."
"Indoors or out, those maps are also very helpful in ways that build on what the original offered. James will scribble notes on his maps, with puzzle answer keys eventually going there for ease of use. He'll also add question marks, which can be read as ""go here next"" indicators, exclamation marks that signal important items to pick up, and he'll even circle previously locked doors once you have the means to open them."
"This helps the game's many puzzles feel manageable, especially as some are wholly new. Yet even these additions feel roundabout and confusing in ways both satisfying and familiar to those who frequent the genre, such as needing to find a can opener to open a can of red paint, in which you dip a lightbulb to simulate a red light that exposes a hidden message on a mirror, thereby allowing you to unlock a briefcase stashing a key for a room elsewhere in a massive hotel. It can sometimes be daunting to play games like this for review before crowdsourced answers to what's stumping you can be found online, but Silent Hill 2's map system helped me get through sections with the appropriate amount of stumbling so I felt challenged but never stuck long enough to become frustrated."
"Sections that may have taken only 30 minutes in the original game now may take two to three hours to complete thanks to how the remake has expanded on certain parts. That isn't to be taken as unnecessary hour-padding. I rarely felt like any section overstayed its welcome; only one late-game area felt overlong. Every other sequence does a fantastic job of diversifying its enemy encounters, building out new puzzles, and giving players more room to explore and rewards for doing so, like stashes of ammo and health kits, as well as a new collectible I suspect is tied to one of the game's new endings."
"The remake improves on the original game's combat as well. The 2001 version's combat was never well-polished, but it did offer a vital quality of unreliability--it was exactly because the game's shooting and melee attacks were so janky that you were left uneasy in that game's tight corridors. In the remake, Bloober Team effectively carries forward that important trait, albeit more intentionally than before. The remake is not beholden to early-2000s hardware, so combat is sculpted to fit the narrative as opposed to just being tricky because of technological restraints."
"Aiming a gun isn't easy, as the reticle sways just enough to make lining up a shot achievable without ever letting James feel like a skilled marksman. Some enemies can be spotted in their hiding places before they've jumped out at you, but they have a knack for making their move at the exact moment you plan to fire a preemptive shot. A late-game rifle also takes a few seconds for the reticle to center, making a quick shot liable to be off-target, but the alternative of waiting for it to right itself often feels like an eternity as enemies are bearing down on you."
"These qualities are very much welcome--Silent Hill 2 mechanically handles like a modern-day shooter, but the aforementioned features add a cumbersome nature to how James moves in a fight. The protagonist isn't a trained shooter, so he shouldn't feel like the characters in Call of Duty or Resident Evil. There's a rewarding sense of skill to Silent Hill 2's combat, but strategy is geared toward trying to aim a single shot, not time many shots. Its enemy encounters are methodical, deliberate, and intense. A shotgun you find midway through the game is the best of the guns since it can instantly snuff out most targets--which is vital in a game where even just two enemies feels like too many. Thankfully, it isn't a crutch you can safely lean on, as ammo for it can be scarce, especially if you stick to the main path and don't explore optional areas."
"Melee combat especially shines. Enemies invade James's space frequently, and his only defenses beyond guns are a sturdy slab of lumber--swapped out later for a metal pipe--and a dodge mechanic that was never there in the 2001 game. This dodge ability pairs well with the enemies' way of constantly encroaching on you, and the game demands you learn their attack patterns and physical tells in order to stay on your own two feet."
"As the game went on, I became increasingly aware of just how tense combat was making me feel. As I'd dodge, fire, dodge, swing, panic-fire, and swing once more, the camera would stay in close, shaking with each hit, making me feel every attack. Downing an enemy isn't the end either, as they can sometimes get back up. Early on in the game, I found myself wailing on downed enemies in a manner one could only describe as overkill just to ensure they didn't return to life seconds or even many minutes later. I never retired this method, either. Eventually, when I was satisfied that I'd removed a group of enemies from an area, I commonly observed my breathing return to normal and felt my shoulders release their tension."
"This was never truer than in boss battles, which smartly reject health bars or really any signposting other than giving you space to avoid attacks and leaving you to figure out the rest. It could easily be frustrating to give players a boss battle without direction, but for Silent Hill 2's bosses, like so much of the game, the unknowable is the point. The solutions are never complex, so squirming in the moment right at the start ends up being another achievement in selling the tension of trying to survive a horrific ordeal."
"The only issue I had with the remake's improved combat mechanics is how abundant ammo--pistol ammo particularly--and health items can become for players who search every corner of an area. I expect a more mainlined player will struggle to make ends meet in James's inventory supply, but for those who leave no door locked, no car window intact, and no drawer closed, you'll sometimes wind up with far too much ammo and too many health items."
"This wasn't always the case, but in two lengthy sections of the game, I'd amassed a triple-digit number of pistol bullets and over 20 health kits, which reads like too many resources in probably any survival-horror game, and that was indeed the case here. To its credit, I did eventually exhaust most of that ammo in boss fights soon after, though I also beat the game without ever dying. Still, my 18-hour journey on normal difficulty was incredibly tense throughout, and though I never saw a game-over screen, my numerous close calls were more than enough and perhaps even more satisfying than having to restart a section anyway. On hard-difficulty runs and/or after a future patch that may rebalance inventory and combat, this problem could fade away."
"Another of the game's best feats is how it transposes the original's grime, grit, and rust into an aesthetic that is high-fidelity but never sanitized. Enemies, like the iconic nurses James encounters in a hospital section, are still a mess of sickly oils and unnervingly featureless faces, their misshapen skin stretched like an ill-fitting bedsheet. The even more mysterious Otherworld James sometimes ends up in is every bit as oppressive and hostile as it was in 2001."
"The lofi PS2 aesthetic that the game naturally enjoyed back then is today a nostalgic North Star for indie devs who grew up on games like Konami's classic. Such art direction does allow for a quality that's hard to define and perhaps pound-for-pound more interesting than a typical triple-A look, but the remake doesn't lose anything for having better facial animations, stronger voice acting, and a more richly detailed world. These attributes only make the game's famous and oft-studied final moments affect me greatly despite knowing what happens beforehand. The two games exist side by side for being outstanding in many of the same ways, just for sometimes different reasons."
"The original Silent Hill 2 is one of the most beloved, culturally significant, and overall best horror games ever made. It appeared to be the case that trying to recapture the magic of that game was to misjudge how impactful its time and place were, and how its limitations helped shape it for the better. Any studio advancing on such a project should've had a Sisyphean task ahead of them, forever chasing its essence like a moth with a hole in your net. However, by staying true to the original game in extremely important ways and taking calculated risks born from an understanding of the source material, all while being supported further by some of the game's original brain trust, Bloober Team has done what was reasonably considered near-impossible. The remake of Silent Hill 2 is a restless dream come true."
"Metaphor: ReFantazio is acutely aware of the role religion and politics play in society, and is more than willing to have conversations some would rather avoid. Furthermore, it is a game that understands the important role fiction plays in helping to establish our most fundamental beliefs, and it does not take that power lightly. Thus, the game begins with its narrator asking the player an important question: Do you believe that fantasy has the power to drive real change? Yes, my heart sang. Yet there was a part of me, cloaked in that aforementioned anxiety, that hesitated. Do art, fiction, and fantasy mean much in a world ravaged by bombs, inequality, injustice, and starvation? I wasn't so sure. By the game's end, however, I felt certain of my answer."
"Metaphor: ReFantazio is a brilliant game packed with adventure, charming characters, heartfelt stories, and elevated versions of Atlus' signature gameplay, art, turn-based combat, and sprawling dungeons. It's also an extraordinarily earnest title that offers comfort to those who need it and asks players to have hope for tomorrow, the people around them, and themselves. By the time my 80 hours with Metaphor came to a close, I felt lighter--younger, too. Its themes and various stories were somehow restorative, and its set pieces brought me back to the RPGs I grew up playing--the ones that shaped me and made me long for companionship and grand adventures. Metaphor is Atlus at its strongest and most sincere. It's the type of game that reminds you of the idealist you were, the person you'd like to be, and how fantasy can shape reality."
"Set in the Kingdom of Euchronia, Metaphor: ReFantazio follows a young boy whose initial mission--deliver a message to a contact in the north pertaining to the rightful-but-comatose prince--evolves into an epic journey. We discover early on that our protagonist was a close friend and confidant of the prince, and longs for nothing more than to see the idealistic young man take the throne following his father's suspicious death. However, the prince has been cursed, forcing him into a deep sleep until the handful of people who know he is alive can find a way to save him."
"While the prince's slumber might be peaceful, his future kingdom is anything but. Giant monstrosities, cheekily referred to as Humans, roam about destroying villages a la Attack on Titan, while social issues turn neighbor against neighbor. Minutes after your character stumbles into Euchronia's capital, Grand Trad, he witnesses a series of hangings. On the ground next to him, a dog-like Paripus--one of the game's handful of tribes, or races--begs for money. We come to find out this race is often treated with extreme cruelty, making it hard for them to find honest work or even exist in the same cities as tribes viewed more favorably. This sort of prejudice is something the protagonist is familiar with, as he is an Elda, the most reviled of all tribes. In fact, the nation's religion claims his very presence is a bad omen. Yet despite his Eldan heritage, the protagonist ultimately decides to do the impossible: Enter the first-ever royal election to win the hearts of the nation's voters in order to secure the prince's throne and get close to those who cursed him."
"The ensuing adventure is one I will never forget, filled with soaring highs, tender moments, devastating losses, and plot twists that, even if you can see them coming, present themselves in unexpected ways, creating a sense of anxiety that echoes what our heroes feel. When I spoke to Atlus developers earlier this year, they mentioned that they were focused on creating a sense of journey in Metaphor: ReFantazio. They accomplished this mission with gusto, as traversing the world in your hefty Gauntlet Runner--which acts both as your mode of transportation and home away from home--feels akin to taking a road trip with your close friends."
"As you trek to new locations, plenty of events and options present themselves to you, ensuring that the game's simplistic traversal never feels dull or leaves you wishing you could operate the vehicle yourself. I never tired of sparring with Strohl, listening to Heismay share his laundry woes, or playing a game of chess with Hulkenberg, all of which level up your social stats as well. I adored the moments when Neuras--the Gauntlet Runner's driver and chief mechanic--would yell down the stairs that we needed to come see something. The party would then gather to look out at a captivating scene, whether it be the gut-wrenching ruins of a village razed by Humans or an ocean filled with neon fish that, somehow, hovered above the planet's surface."
"Naturally, so much of the story's success comes from its beautifully crafted and well-voiced characters. I fell head-over-heels for the noble Strohl and couldn't help but smile as Hulkenberg, an often stoic and put-together knight, slurped down whatever local delicacy she could find at each city we visited as her friends looked on in horror. Heismay was a particularly impactful character, offering a tragic backstory and plenty of Uncle Iroh-style moments. In fact, there wasn't one of the game's six joining party members I didn't adore. And despite loathing the man, the game's major antagonist, Louis, is a mesmerizing villain, oozing with charisma, tact, and good looks. It's no wonder he is so beloved, feared, and such a powerful, suffocating force throughout the world. I also enjoyed how many of the major characters play somewhat unassuming roles at first, making themselves known to you briefly only to come back and play a much more important role down the road, adding a sense of life and progression to the game."
"Atlus also made the decision to give Metaphor's protagonist a voice, something new for a studio that tends to favor the strong and silent type. The delivery of some of his lines adds so much personality and humor to the game that would otherwise be lost, elevating the entire experience and making me care substantially more about what would become of him on his journey to take the throne and save his best friend. In fact, the only complaint I can level in the character department is I wish there were more voice acting, as some social links--to my dismay--aren't fully voiced; it's a shame when both the characters and actors are so charming."
"Still, their stories are brilliant vessels to deliver the game's major themes. While not particularly novel--fantasy and sci-fi have often acted as ways to discuss social issues somewhat removed from the context of our world--Metaphor: ReFantazio impressed me by placing emphasis on long-term collective action and compassion while also admitting that we will probably never know how to ""get things right."" It handles its topics and politics with maturity and precision, respecting the player's intelligence and avoiding falling into one of two dreaded camps: ""everyone is right/respectable and the world is completely grey,"" and ""there is a clear right and wrong and you are the savior who dictates what is what."" It also doesn't shirk away from allowing real-world context to seep into the game, creating a sort of metanarrative that pops up in surprising ways, yet doesn't overstay its welcome or cheapen the experience."
"These ideas are elevated through the side stories, often told through social links, which serve as more intimate explorations of grief, prejudice, vengeance, and forgiveness. In many of these narratives, we watch as a character tries to navigate living in a world that wronged them. How do you not give into fear or hatred? How do you go on living when your reason to is taken from you? How do you make the world a better place when a part of you wants nothing more than to burn it all down? Atlus has never been one to shy away from dark topics, yet somehow Metaphor: ReFantazio dives into more heart-wrenching territory than ever before while also retaining this well-suited sense of whimsical idealism throughout all of it."
"This juxtaposition is perfectly reflected in the game's art and music, which pairs angelic choirs atop delicate orchestral pieces before transitioning into booming tracks that feature frantic chanting. There is something about the game's sound that, while still feeling ethereal and adventurous, conveys this feeling of religious fervor and fanaticism--a recurring theme throughout the story. It's dynamic and beautiful, while also being peculiar and suffocating."
"Metaphor's art quickly separates itself from many Atlus titles by abandoning the studio's tendency to use a single color to convey the game's theme--an interesting choice considering the intense focus on the struggle between anxiety and hope, idealism and fanaticism. Rather than settle on a single color, Metaphor uses raspberry pink, teal, aquamarine, a saturated leafy green, and deep cornflower blue throughout its menus, with splatter effects, fades, and distortions adding a sense of anxiety and violence to colors that otherwise don't feel aggressive. And yet it works. Instead of one color being associated with the game itself, colors become motifs for certain characters, factions, and locations, creating a sense of variety and travel that the Persona series--which roots itself primarily in one location--doesn't quite get the chance to convey. Though I was originally worried that all these effects and the game's liberal use of texture--most noticeably, a sort of misty film grain can be seen in many scenes--could be distracting, I was a big fan of it in execution. All this texture, floating particles, and grain made the air feel thick--abundant in tension and magic."
"It's also worth stating that Metaphor might be Atlus' most successful attempt at making its fully animated cutscenes blend into in-game cutscenes. Sure, there is a noticeable difference between the anime-inspired clips and what Metaphor's gameplay looks like, but by utilizing interesting camera angles and focusing on color harmony, the best of both worlds are brought front and center."
"Metaphor's strategic use of these contrasting elements and themes keeps every moment interesting while its fantastic story steadily propels things forward. In fact, Metaphor might be the former-Persona team's most well-paced game to date. Though it uses several of the same systems as the Persona series (most notably its calendar, social links, and social stats systems), it all feels more intentional; your skill-building activities, social links, and various side quests carry more weight and are more grand in scale, eliminating that feeling that you are engaging with filler to pass time or are simply going through the motions to level up a particular skill. Additionally, every mission's end date felt like just the right amount of time to do everything, if you used your time wisely; I was neither pressed for time nor trying to find dull ways to kill it."
"I am not by nature someone who longs to complete every side quest and bounty in a game, and never once have I aimed to fuse every persona in any of the Persona entries I've played. And yet, I was more than happy to do everything Metaphor offered, whether it be slaying monsters, embarking on a quest to retrieve a magical toothbrush, dungeon-crawling, or meticulously building out a character's Archetype tree. It helps that everything feels streamlined yet fully realized. Dungeons are interesting and intentionally laid out, with small puzzles making them more memorable than those found in the Persona series. There are fewer social links and, to my initial dismay, none of them truly offer romance. Ultimately, however, I grew to love this decision, as it results in the relationships feeling even stronger and less like a reward for saying the right things, further encouraging you to build them up and reap both the wisdom and benefits that come with their camaraderie."
"Many of these benefits make themselves apparent in the Archetype system, which, contrary to initial concerns, feels nothing like Atlus' Persona system. Archetypes function more like jobs, permitting every character to grow proficient in any number of the game's 30 or so classes. Social links are closely tied to this system, as it is your companions who ultimately unlock new Archetypes and grant you the ability to select spells and abilities from one class to add to another. You can then build up your classes using magla, or MAG--a currency earned in various ways throughout the game, such as combat or socialization--to purchase new classes or already learned skills to give to another Archetype. It was so satisfying to have an extraordinary evasive Ninja who also could also hurl out black magic, or a tanky Knight with the ability to heal my entire team. I was also blown away by how brilliant this system is within the context of the game, drawing attention to how, at its core, Metaphor is a fairy tale that relies on these literary roles and established tropes to convey meaning. Leave it to Atlus to do a remarkable job at incorporating literature and Jungian psychology in subtle yet powerful ways."
"The game's combat might be the best version of turn-based battles Atlus has ever created, offering flexibility while also asking for greater strategy than before. Combat uses turn counters, which hover like stars on the screen's top left corner. Critical hits and taking advantage of an enemy's weak point only use half a star, allowing you to hit an enemy up to eight times before it can turn its sights on you if you play your cards right. This comes in clutch, as clearing an encounter before an enemy can land a blow grants a substantial Unscathed Battle bonus. If you're like me and become obsessed with ensuring you come out untouched, you can quickly restart the battle with the touch of a button, allowing you to try out different strategies and experiment until you find an enemy's weakness."
"Each party member can also pair up with another to unleash powerful Synergy abilities, which change not based on who you have in your party but what classes everyone is using--and being able to swap party members out for only half a turn counter means you can play around with these combinations in battle. These abilities generally use up two to three turn counters, but if you use them to hit a weakness, you have a way to deal massive damage while still keeping your turns. Enemies also operate using turn counters, but through experimentation you can find ways to use this to your advantage. It was incredibly satisfying watching the tough-as-nails Hulkenberg taunt an enemy and then take advantage of her massive chance to repel an attack to make an enemy lose all its turns."
"I've always been a fan and defender of turn-based combat, even as it's slowly phased out in favor of action-driven combat. But even I can admit there are some faults with it, and grinding out enemies can be a real annoyance when you have to wait to both enter and exit a battle and feel forced to waste MP taking down smaller enemies when you know you have a boss lurking around the corner. Metaphor finds a remedy to all of these grievances in allowing you to also hack at enemies while roaming around a dungeon. Once you reach a set level, select enemies will possess a blue aura, which means you can take them down without ever entering battle and still attain experience, MAG, and gold from the encounter. Sneaking up on an elite monster--or dishing out enough swings to take them down before they land a hit on you--results in you starting each battle with major advantages. This makes a big difference, as some of the game's battles are absolutely grueling. Fortunately, you can adjust the game's difficulty at any time which I, admittedly, had to do to clear a few optional endgame bosses with absolutely devastating gimmicks and attacks."
"Somehow, Metaphor: ReFantazio is even greater than the sum of its parts, yet each piece of the game is masterfully crafted. I found the whole experience transcendent and was impressed by how it felt both novel yet familiar--elevated and modern, yet so reminiscent to the fantasy RPGs I sunk countless hours into on my little grey PlayStation. But most importantly, it made me remember that we are lost without hope. It sounds silly and cliche, I know--sometimes it can be. It also certainly doesn't put out the fires set all over the world. But it reminded me that giving into despair and fear serves no one, myself included. It reminded me that fantasy and fiction have power--words and stories have power. They can inspire and comfort, and these things that are vital to preserving. And it reminded me that the proof of good in the world can be us, and that's a good start."
"FC IQ is the driving force behind most of EA FC 25's forward momentum. The previous tactics system has been discarded and replaced by a malleable set of new Player Roles that dictate how your team functions with much more variety than before. As a result, the team-wide aspects of any given tactic have been streamlined, simply letting you set the depth of your defensive line and pick a build-up style based on short passing, countering, or a balanced mix of the two. Once you've picked a strategy and a formation you're happy with, you can begin applying specific roles to each player to really define its identity, balancing the risk and reward of certain roles and their impact on the team."
"Every position has several Player Roles that govern a player's movement and positioning when they don't have the ball, both when your team has possession and when it doesn't. A central midfielder, for instance, fits into one of five roles, ranging from a playmaker to a half winger. The latter is new and sees your center mid drift out wide--similar to how Kevin De Bruyne often plays for Manchester City--letting you create overloads on one side of the pitch or whip balls into the box with a more proficient crosser than either your winger or fullback. This introduces more ways for you to create chances and gives you something else to think about when devising a tactic, making the whole process much more engaging."
"Most roles also have a Focus that alters how a player behaves within the confines of their role. You can set a half winger to play a more balanced game, alternating equally between attacking and defending, or give them the freedom to be more forward-thinking, abandoning their defensive responsibilities in favor of pushing the attack."
"To fill this vacated space in the middle of the park, you might deploy one of your fullbacks with the new falseback role, which sees them drift centrally as an extra midfielder when you're in possession. Not every fullback can perform such a specialized role adequately, however. In fact, no player is suited to every role, even if it's in their preferred position, so Role Familiarity guides you in how best to set up your team. Someone like Vinícius Júnior can play as a winger without compromising his abilities, but switching to a role he's accomplished on world-class at, such as an inside forward, will make him display more tactical and positional intelligence, resulting in better-timed runs and faster transitions from defense to attack."
"This makes building a team in Career mode or Ultimate Team much more compelling than before. Do you construct a tactic and find players to fit it? Or do you ensure that each player is playing in their preferred role, regardless of what this does to the shape of your team? These are important considerations to make, adding another wrinkle to team-building that goes beyond numbered attributes like pace and shooting ability."
"The formation you settle on--whether it's 3-5-2, 4-3-3, or something else in between--determines the shape of your team when defending. The Player Roles within this formation might maintain the same shape once you transition to attack or morph into something entirely new. Fortunately, there's a handy toggle that shows you how your players will position themselves both on and off the ball, and in practice, this makes for a lot more variance in the teams you'll come up against. You could face two teams with the exact same formation, but depending on how they've tailored each individual Player Role, you'll often notice a tangible difference in their approach."
"Adding more variety to how players move and occupy certain positions is fantastic, but doubly so when there isn't a discernible difference in how EA FC 25 actually feels to play compared to last year's game. Sure, the general pace of play is slower--as is often the case at the start of each yearly cycle--and the plethora of new animations, particularly when shooting, make for some satisfying moments and goals. Yet it doesn't do enough to distinguish itself as a positive step forward. There's still a good game of football here, but any improvements are merely incremental, and it still comes saddled with the same long-standing issues. Tackling and player switching are both unreliable, goalkeepers are maddeningly inconsistent--pulling off wonder saves only to concede shots hit directly at them--and it's still more effective to spam skill moves than break down defenses with intricate passing. It's a shame that these problems still exist."
"To make matters worse, the input delay currently affecting online matches results in a frustrating and sluggish experience when playing against others. Curiously, it's not an issue in the new Rush mode, but trying to play Rivals matches in Ultimate Team is a slog. Even the game's menus are afflicted by a similar issue, feeling like it's constantly chugging behind your button inputs. This makes menu-heavy modes like Career and Ultimate Team aggravating to navigate. I fell foul of a number of crashes on PS5, too, most frequently when accessing the store to open new packs and at the end of games."
"Fortunately, much like FC IQ, Rush is an excellent new addition to the series, replacing Volta with quick five-a-side matches (one AI goalkeeper and four outfield players) that promise frantic action and bundles of goals. These five-minute contests are played on a smaller pitch and are governed by a unique ruleset. Kick-offs, for instance, are similar to those in Rocket League, with both teams lining up in their own half before the ball is dropped into the center circle, resulting in a mad dash to the middle as both teams try to attain possession first. Meanwhile, offsides only trigger when in the final third, and red cards have been replaced by a blue variant that condemns the offending player to the sin bin for a whole minute. It's chaotic fun and feels distinct enough from regular matches to provide a gratifying change of pace."
"Rush is available in Kick Off, Career, Ultimate Team, and Clubs, so there are a few different ways to play. In Career mode, it's used for youth tournaments, allowing you to play as your best wunderkinds and develop their attributes before they're ready to step up to the first team. In Ultimate Team, you can hop into drop-in matches with three random players or play with friends, picking one player from your club to control. Sometimes, there are restrictions on the pool of players you can choose from, and you're also incentivized to select players from specific leagues and nations to earn bonus points that go towards XP for the season pass. Drop-in matches are a bit of a crapshoot when it comes to finding good teammates. Some people will refuse to defend or pass, while others have seemingly no idea how the offside rule works. It's easy to disrupt a game when there are only four players on each team, so it's definitely preferable to play with friends if you can."
"Aside from the inclusion of youth tournaments, Career mode has also been given attention in a few other areas. You're now afforded more flexibility in how you customize the experience, from setting the leniency of your board's expectations to speeding up or slowing down the development rate of your players. If you choose the simulation gameplay type, you must also contend with inclement weather. A windy afternoon will affect the ball's trajectory, while a rainy downpour adds more zip to ground passes and causes players to occasionally slip. It's disappointing that these effects aren't a factor in online matches, but it makes sense in the name of balance."
"The long-overdue inclusion of several major women's leagues is another welcome addition to Career mode. You can even start a Player Career as one of the game's Icons, though it's odd that you're limited to a meager four options considering how many reside in Ultimate Team. Regardless, who doesn't want to start a Career with Thierry Henry starting up top for Stevenage? These may only be minor improvements, but they're improvements nonetheless."
"As for Ultimate Team, EA's cash cow has seen very few changes, but the ones that have been introduced aren't exactly positive. The rewards for racking up wins in Rivals have been downgraded despite the fact you now need to win 15 matches in a week rather than the previous seven. It's a significant time commitment when you also factor in the other objectives you might potentially want to complete across Rush, Squad Battles, and Friendlies. On top of this, qualifying for Champions--where the greatest rewards are located--is now reserved for the best players. In the past, you only needed to win four games out of 10 to qualify. Now, you must win three out of five matches to earn your spot in the finals, a decision that feels like it was fueled by the mode's pay-to-win microtransactions. Those who spend the most money are more likely to gain access to the best rewards."
"There's a lot to like about EA FC 25, from the overhauled tactics to the chaotic addition of Rush and a few welcome improvements to Career mode. It's not a resounding victory, however. The on-field action has stagnated, maintaining its quality but also plenty of its flaws, while changes to Ultimate Team feel antagonistic in their design. In the near future, issues like input lag and its propensity to crash will hopefully be fixed, but the same is unlikely to be true for its long-standing problems. At the end of the day--to borrow common football player lingo--there's fun to be had with EA FC 25, especially if you enjoyed last year's game, but rather than taking a significant leap forward, it's content to settle for midtable form."
"You could argue the current media landscape's obsession with crossovers, mash-ups, and hearty stews of intellectual property began with Funko Pop, collectible vinyl figures that have been popular for many years now and are made to resemble just about anything from pop culture--from rockstars and Star Trek villains, to cereal mascots and retired athletes. Before Fortnite became something like a Funko Pop game in its own way, Funko Pop figures were decorating mall stores and collectors' shelves with fan favorites and deep cuts. In retrospect, it's surprising we didn't get a Funko Pop console and PC game until now, though given the state of Funko Fusion, we would have been better off continuing to wait."
"Presented in an over-the-(tiny)-shoulder third-person view akin to Lego Star Wars' latest effort, Funko Fusion similarly has you running around colorful worlds inspired by movies and TV shows you may already enjoy. Whereas the Lego games tend to pull from the tip-top of the popularity stack and adapt things like Marvel and Lord of the Rings, Funko Fusion takes on a fascinatingly strange assortment of series."
"The biggest of them, Jurassic World, fits well in that aforementioned top tier. Beyond that, however, you'll find hub worlds, levels, and characters inspired by unexpected and smaller properties, with the full list of main attractions including Scott Pilgrim, Hot Fuzz, The Thing, Masters of the Universe, The Umbrella Academy, and Battlestar Galactica (the 1978 version). This list reads like the involved IP were all chosen randomly, but in actuality, it's because they share a common distributor: Universal Studios."
"Each world unfolds much like a Lego game. You'll drop into a 3D level full of objects to smash and bad guys to pummel or shoot at, solving puzzles to advance between the regular attacks from villains. The music and scenery change for each property in fun ways--an early Scott Pilgrim level uses the movie's soundtrack, for example, which I haven't heard since it debuted years ago but immediately recognized as being from the Michael Cera-led adaptation. This was an even more exciting feature when I got to The Thing levels, where the silly vinyl statues were made just a bit creepier thanks to the film's unnerving music amplifying the foreboding nature of the surrounding snowy hellscape. Of course, using the music from each property is to be expected, but while it wasn't surprising, it was immersive anyway."
"Despite wearing its Lego inspiration on its sleeve, Funko Fusion is not really for kids. That's apparent in a few ways--like The Thing being involved at all, or how Scott Pilgrim's band, Sex Bob-Omb, is prominently featured in the run of levels set in the Edgar Wright movie's universe. But it's more obviously not for younger players in ways that ultimately make it worse, even for its intended audience. Unlike the Lego series, which followed a formula honed over dozens of games across nearly 20 years, Funko Fusion fails to stick to its internal logic when it comes to level and puzzle design, and quickly becomes frustrating and confusing as a result."
"The Lego games were famous for their light puzzle elements, which the team at TT Games call ""nuzzles,"" short for ""not puzzles."" Designed to make players stumble only briefly while skillfully pointing them to the solution with on-screen hints like rattling bricks or sparkling terminals, there is an art to how a Lego game level unfolds. An adult-oriented game that adapted the Lego games' take on puzzles and just made them tougher could have worked, but that's not what Funko Fusion is, in large part because its levels rarely make visual sense. When I played a portion of Funko Fusion earlier this year, I figured my confusion around some of the game's puzzle mechanics was due to having missed a tutorial section that would be in the full game and explain away issues I had. As it turns out, no such tutorial exists, which commonly left me confused about how to proceed. Funko Fusion's level design doesn't provide enough direction to maintain an enjoyable sense of progress."
"This issue is exacerbated by the way Funko Fusion fails to telegraph which parts of its levels are meant for now and which aspects are meant to be revisited on replays after more items or characters have been unlocked. An early level in my playthrough featured yellow arrows painted in front of a locked door. I'd never seen them before, and to that point in my playthrough, I hadn't noticed anything that was gated off to me. I learned only much later, while playing The Umbrella Academy levels, that a particular character in that world can phase through the wall if they stand on those arrows and perform a dash."
"In the moment, I fidgeted with the environment for a few frustrating minutes, trying to determine what I was meant to do, when really the answer was simply ""come back later."" The game doesn't tell you this in any way--not via a tutorial and not with easily understood in-level hints. You're left to guess and troubleshoot, which sometimes led me to give up on puzzles I later realized actually were doable, but the inconsistent visual language of the game had me dizzy and questioning my efforts throughout many of its 30+ levels."
"Funko Fusion doesn't benefit from years of first-hand practice like TT Games' series does, but it seems to clearly look to the Lego games closely, so it's a bit baffling that the level and puzzle design ignore some of the vital qualities that make those games so enjoyable. It captures the broad strokes of a Lego game but misses many of the nuanced strengths of that series. It may benefit from being distinct from its contemporaries and not being as formulaic as the Lego series became over 20 years, but Funko Fusion swaps out a recognizable and beloved formula for irritating chaos driven by poor in-game signposting."
"Other puzzles are similarly frustrating, though sometimes for different reasons. A recurring type is a locked chest full of loot, such as limited-use superweapons and health kits, that can only be opened if you pull on four levers before a timer expires. You can do this in a few ways, such as running the optimal route to get them all in time, or using a faster character or drinking a speed-boosting soda you may have found. But some examples of this puzzle seemingly can't be done if you have neither the consumable nor an appropriate character. Still, because earlier puzzles of the same nature could be handled with a bit of extra ingenuity, I wasted time trying to see what I was missing, rather than quickly determining I just wasn't equipped with the right tools yet. The game routinely introduces a concept, then changes it without telling you, making puzzles more like a lockbox without a key than a Rubik's Cube."
"That problem cascades even further due to shoddy, often frustrating combat. Shooting doesn't feel accurate, and strangely cranking up the aim assist to try to solve that problem seemingly didn't change anything, or if it did, it was too subtle for me to notice. Melee is reliable enough--just get in close and mash the punch button--but I experienced a range of complications with this. Enemies sometimes corner-trapped me, and infinitely-spawning enemies would undermine puzzles by getting in my way and reducing the timing windows of some solutions. There were some mini-boss encounters that, like the puzzles, have to be figured out with in-the-moment trial-and-error, rather than the levels leading up to them acting as a tutorial to prep me or expressive visual language guiding me toward the solution during the fight."
"There's one recurring mini-boss type who sponges a ton of damage before finally being made to dizzily walk toward a circle on the ground, but what to do after that was lost on me for a while. Eventually, I realized that if I looked high above them, I could send a chandelier crashing down by shooting it. This put them in a similarly groggy state, but one that demanded a different tactic, as it left them open to melee attacks. While the initial realization introduced a bit of interesting consideration to the fight, finding the solution to the problem at hand simply made another problem by making the fight too easy as the mini-boss then just stood there unmoving as I wailed on them with a barrage of hits. The process felt so overlong it became comical."
"Regardless of the IP you're exploring, the world bosses themselves follow a familiar format of hitting the glowing spots while dodging minions across multiple phases. These sections are at least consistent and better at explaining what you should do, but that's a rare bright spot, and not too vibrant anyway."
"So many of the game's issues could be made less severe or even disappear if Funko Fusion's co-op functionality was in place, but the game was curiously launched without any of that available. Instead, four-player online co-op will come to different worlds, in a piecemeal rollout, over the months ahead, starting with Jurassic World in October. The publisher told critics this is because it wanted to prioritize the studio's work-life balance and give developers a well-earned rest. That sounds great to me, except it seems to overlook the idea that the game could've just been delayed entirely."
"Instead, rolling it out in this state amplifies several of the game's worst aspects; Without allies to aid you, the enemies regularly interrupt puzzle solutions, timed puzzles with unforgiving timers become harder or impossible, and even the game's vague puzzles in quiet spaces can take longer without a group brainstorming element that should've been there from the start."
"That isn't to say the game is all bad. One of the cooler parts about it are its secret levels and characters, which go well beyond the six major hub worlds to include shorter stints in additional settings like Child's Play, Jaws, Five Nights at Freddy's, and more. In general, Funko Fusion leans into horror properties in a way that feels unnecessary but also pleasantly surprising. We're unlikely to ever see a second game based on Jordan Peele's Nope, making the novelty of it being found here so notable, even as secret levels aren't immune to the game's structural issues either."
"One thing the game does borrow from the Lego series in a skilled way is how the toys' unique opportunities for humor can be used to reinterpret classic scenes or lean into the nature of the figures themselves. Standout examples include a moment in the first Jurassic World level when a character's big head gets stuck in a doorway as she tries to escape roaming dinosaurs, or how you can cartoonishly pop the heads off of enemies if you hit them just right. Each world does well to capture its source material even as things are redressed in smooth vinyl textures. In the case of the He-Man levels, the entire world benefits from a stylish cel-shaded look, too, which isn't exactly how that show looked, but it does make it stick out as a cartoon in a sea of live-action properties."
"It's also worth mentioning a patch released during my early days with the game that soothed some of the game's more painful aspects, like making it easier to unlock additional worlds. Funko Fusion lets you pick any world to start, but it doesn't tell you that some are better to start with than others as they reduce how much backtracking you'll need to perform. You have to learn this the hard way, like I did when I started with Scott Pilgrim and later learned the studio recommends it as the last world to play."
"Now, the game's use of Crowns, discovered in levels and additionally earned for completing them, can more easily unlock worlds and characters, which gets right to the heart of the game's appeal: running around as various pop culture heroes and villains in worlds either familiar or not their own. More patches are needed though, not just to fix the aforementioned confusion around moving through levels, but even to polish the game, like fixing some audio problems that currently manifest as loud screeches instead of, for example, car-engine noises."
"With more attention to balancing and better, earlier explanations of how its puzzles, boss encounters, and items behave, I could see Funko Fusion eventually being the enjoyable, adult-oriented Lego alternative it wants to be. It needs some important fixes, but they don't seem like unattainable goals in this era of living games that are constantly evolving. The eventual widespread co-op functionality should hopefully make the game better all on its own, and if more helpful visual language and tooltips arrive soon, too, the game could be redeemed. Until then, however, this is one Funko product not worth displaying on your shelf."
"PC version update (September 25, 2024): Just shy of its two-year anniversary, Sony Santa Monica's God of War Ragnarok has arrived on PC, with porting duties shared with Jetpack Interactive. As is now typical with Sony's various PC endeavors, this port comes with the expected enhancements for the platform: ultrawide support, a variety of upscaling options, and improved frame rates, all of which should soften the blow of the extended waiting period. As you might expect, these features make it easy to customize your experience to match your current PC configuration, but God of War Ragnarok isn't flawless as many of Sony's previous PC ports have been."
"The improved performance offered by powerful PC configurations is immediately noticeable during the opening moments of Ragnarok. The fluidity afforded by the higher frame rates made it impossible to return to even the PS5 version, with performance sustained above 80 frames per second on my RTX 3080Ti and AMD Ryzen 5 5600X at 1440p and set to the game's highest Ultra preset (the equivalent to PS5's Quality mode). Utilizing DLSS, I was able to boost this well above 100fps with indiscernible impact on the image; AMD's FSR 3.1 and Intel XeSS are available too, as well as Sony Santa Monica's internal Temporal technique that was used on PS4 and PS5. Frame generation is also available for RTX 40-series GPUs via DLSS 3, while AMD cards (and older Nvidia ones) can make use of frame generation from FSR 3.1 (although results here aren't nearly as good as Nvidia's implementation)."
"Perhaps most surprisingly, God of War Ragnarok runs far better than you might expect on Valve's Steam Deck. Getting a locked 30fps was a breeze, utilizing the Quality present on FSR 3.1 and using mostly Medium settings (with only Shadows and Atmospherics knocked down to Low). This configuration is better than that of the base PS4, which Jetpack Interactive says aligns with the game's Low preset. Having it run that well on a portable platform wasn't something I expected going in, and I was surprised at how much I wanted to continue playing on the Steam Deck with its stunning OLED display bringing the Fimbulwinter tundra to life."
"The effects of making changes to graphical settings can be seen on the paused game scene visible through the transparent menu, letting you see changes take place in real time, which is always appreciated. Oddities arise, however, when the game is in motion. I ran into numerous instances where the game's UI was incorrectly rendering, resolving in large, blocky and pixelated images for a range of icons from Kratos' currently equipped weapon to frequent controller input prompts. There were also two other instances where the game locked me into a slow moving walk with Kratos, preventing me from moving at a normal pace through the world and, more importantly, combat. A handful of crashes also peppered my experience, although the majority cleared up after the openings to both the main campaign and Valhalla epilogue."
"These issues aren't deal-breakers by any stretch, and most were resolved with a reboot of the game and will likely be addressed by patches in the future. But it gives the port a less-than-stellar sheen that is at odds with the quality you might have come to expect from PC releases from Sony-owned Nixxes. That's especially true when God of War Ragnarok continues the trend of solid, but otherwise predictable PC enhancements that omit larger improvements such as ray tracing. If you've never experienced God of War Ragnarok, then there's a strong chance this port will satisfy you after the extended wait. It's just a pity it's not flawless as the extra time might have you expecting. -- Alessandro Barbosa"
"God of War Ragnarok is a lavish production with pristine visuals, jaw-dropping scale, crunchy combat that is as satisfying as it is brutal, and a world that begs to have its every corner and crevice explored. It's a spectacular blockbuster, but these are the least of its achievements."
"In a game where a hulking god rips all manner of creatures limb from limb, the most shocking moments aren't bathed in blood, but carried by poignant words and heartfelt emotions. They are a former God of War--known for mercilessly killing his kin--finding the words to empathize with loss; a despondent child emploring a father to break a self-destructive cycle; a moment of tenderness in the life of a boy that has the weight of the world on his shoulders."
"God of War Ragnarok's most impressive achievements are its exploration of loss and love; grief and growth; determinism and defiance. It's an astoundingly well-written game that deconstructs the mythology of Norse gods and rebuilds it as an odyssey about families. Its story isn't about the end of the world, but those that have a hand in it. They're revered as mythical gods but are characterized by deep flaws, twisted by skewed perspectives, and corrupted by questionable motivations in the same way the people they preside over are. And yet, some also have redemptive qualities. In that respect, Ragnarok's story is told from a grey area where nuances blur the line between heroes and villains; good and evil. By constantly challenging you to reconsider who they are and the factors that drive their actions, these characters remain compelling throughout."
"There are moments when characters you're not supposed to be rooting for reveal the trials and tribulations that have shaped them, or the demons they battle. This alone is enough to humanize them, but Ragnarok also mirrors the struggles of the protagonists in the antagonists, forcing you to ask yourself, ""If I'm willing to empathize with the good guys because of what they're going through, shouldn't I do the same for the bad guys?"" The answer, it turns out, is very complicated, and that's what makes the story so captivating."
"Although Kratos and Atreus are the stars of the show, almost every character is in the midst of their own complicated journey. For some, it's one that will lift them from a pit of despair or pull them from darkness and onto a brighter path. For others, it's one that fuels obsessions that could be the undoing of everything and everyone. This is best illustrated by Kratos and Atreus who, by killing Baldur at the end of the last game, act as the harbingers of the end times."
"The consequences of this moment weigh differently on them, and what they feel is their responsibility because their actions pull them in different directions. Kratos, who has finally learned to guide his son through love instead of fear, focuses on steering him away from conflict and the affairs of the Aesir gods, but does so with the knowledge that his son is prophesized to play a part in Ragnarok and he is destined to die. Atreus, meanwhile, is compelled to prevent Ragnarok and find out who he is as Loki–the name he was given by the Giants–and sets off to find Tyr, the Norse God of War, to achieve his goals. This complicated dynamic serves as the conflict between them: a man that wants to avoid war at all costs, having learned the toll it extracts firsthand, versus a boy who believes war is the only way to unseat a power that has ruined the lives of so many."
"Those who remember Atreus's power-tripping fledgling God phase from the last game will also remember how frustrating it was to go through that--there's nothing more annoying than an arrogant child. But Ragnarok treats the differences in perspective between father and son in a much different way. Kratos is now reckoning with letting his son forge his own path and learning that holding on too tight could push him away. Atreus has matured since we last saw him and is now more cognizant that his actions can and will have consequences. As a result, the dynamic has shifted to where Kratos is trying to learn about his son instead of defining him, while Atreus does his best to see things from his father's perspective. And in both cases, Mimir's counsel plays a major part in this. The fruits of the journey that both characters underwent in the previous game are carried forward into this sequel and, thanks to the superb writing and acting, the back-and-forths between them are genuinely interesting. There's a newfound sense of mutual respect in these conversations, which is uncharted territory for Kratos, and in turn feeds into the motif of growth that underpins God of War Ragnarok."
"This is a game where you will see people change in meaningful ways. Without revealing details, new characters and those you became intimately familiar with in the previous game have experiences that profoundly impact them and the people around them. God of War Ragnarok is rich in themes to unpack, from the influence of families and generational trauma to how abuses of power and emotional manipulation can change people. God of War Ragnarok places the Norse pantheon under the harshest of lights to show how deeply flawed they are, and we're able to explore that thoroughly through our own experiences with them, as well as tales told by others that have their own. Mimir, the self-professed smartest man alive, returns to offer his insight on all things Norse history, as do the various writings scattered throughout the realms that recount complex histories, the tales of notable figures, or provide insight into the thoughts and feelings of various characters."
"God of War Ragnarok is a long game, but at every step of the journey, the writing and characterization make it count. It justifies that runtime by cultivating an intimacy with the characters that is only possible by spending hours and hours with them, learning how they see the world, and what influences their thinking. And pretty much every character is fascinating, but especially the Aesir gods, who can be a cruel bunch at the best of times. With the looming threat of their demise, however, each of them begins to unravel in different ways. For some, their nature becomes concentrated further, which has unfortunate repercussions. Others, however, are forced to rethink what truly matters to them."
"There have been a lot of takes on Norse mythology, but God of War Ragnarok's is easily one of the most memorable. It's elevated by the presence of Kratos, whose past life as a Greek God provides him with a unique perspective, but also because he's placed at the center of it. The legends that we're used to are molded around him and his son, and they adhere in a way that is truly impressive. When all is said and done, you can stand back and marvel at how neatly– and creatively–different strands of narratives and characterization from older God of War titles, the previous entry in this rebooted series, and Norse mythology as a whole have been weaved together."
"When it comes to confronting Kratos and Atreus's enemies on the battlefield, God of War Ragnarok doesn't make any drastic departures from the previous game, though there are some new additions and expansions made to key mechanics. Fundamentally, however, the core gameplay remains the same, and this is in its favor. My familiarity with the previous game meant it was very easy to begin tearing my way through the battlefield and the close camera angle offers a dramatic front-row seat to the brutality Kratos's legendary reputation is built upon."
"There's a maniacal kind of glee that comes from stomping around arenas swinging the trusty Leviathan axe to cleave Draugrs, Elves, dragons, demons, and all manner of other fantastic creatures. Even all these hours later, the thrill of hurling the axe into the distance and then recalling it back to your side hasn't diminished one bit, and with new skill trees to work through, this ability continues to provide ample opportunities to create flashy combos that hit hard."
"This time around, Kratos also has access to the Blades of Chaos from the outset, and Sony Santa Monica has put them to great use. As well as serving as excellent crowd-control tools and dishing out extra damage to ice-aligned creatures, the fiery blades are also used to emphasize mobility and verticality. Kratos can latch onto enemies and close the distance with them, which means they're very handy for target prioritization and even escape tactics. But they're also essential for quickly ascending to elevated platforms, where enemies often position themselves to take potshots. This means you'll need to have a much keener awareness of your surroundings and ensure these threats are addressed quickly. A small but very welcome new addition is the ability to launch off elevated areas and execute plunging attacks on those below, which ensures that the sense of momentum that is built in skirmishes isn't lost when moving around the battlefield."
"My favorite weapon remains Kratos's trusty fists, which hit like boulders and generate a significant amount of stun. Like the previous game, enemies have a stun meter which, when filled, opens them up to devastating cinematic finishers that are weapon-specific and usually involve rending something in two, crushing bones, or eviscerating the enemy entirely. It's a wince-inducing kind of viciousness that really drives home the power fantasy of being a god, which is ironic considering that Kratos in God of War Ragnarok is a much more balanced and, I daresay, emotionally stable person. The contrast actually ends up working for the game, as it becomes a stark reminder of how far Kratos has come to be able to cage that kind of beast within him."
"Another area that has been expanded is shields. You were previously limited to just one, but in Ragnarok, Kratos has access to a wider range of shields. Each one usually has a playstyle it caters to, so for those who want to focus on parrying attacks to create openings, there are a selection that will enable that. But if you're the kind of person that likes to tank damage, bigger and sturdier options are available. Shields also usually have a secondary function that is executed by tapping L1 twice to check an enemy and create space, slam the shield into the ground to break guard, retaliate with a punch that knocks them back, or even rush forward. This new wrinkle further enhances the offensive feel of combat by letting you go from the back foot to the front in an instant. It's a smart little addition that means you can switch up your playstyle, should you want to."
"Further enhancing what Kratos is capable of are the various role-playing systems that are tied to equipment. Naturally, equipment can be upgraded to improve their strength, the effectiveness of the element they are imbued with, or the power of the unique Runic attack, among other things. But the most tangible additions are often in the attachments, some of which will further enhance attributes while others go so far as to introduce new functionality--like sending consecutive waves of frost with every swing of the axe. Armor is treated similarly, bestowing pluses and minuses to attributes or having a unique effect that is activated by certain conditions. None of this is particularly game-changing or innovative, but it does offer the freedom to create a build for Kratos that caters to your style of play. In my case, for example, I like to play extremely aggressively and adopt high-risk strategies where parrying comes before blocking and dodging. Because of this, I focused on acquiring and upgrading equipment that rewarded me for this aggression. My entire strategy was built around rushing in and punching enemies into submission until they became vulnerable to cinematic executions, which would in turn grant me a burst of health recovery. I combined this with a relic that creates a Realm Shift, effectively slowing down time and giving me another opening to unleash a flurry of strikes or the space to hunt down life-restoring gems that might be on the battlefield."
"Kratos's aggression is reflected in the enemies, which hit much harder than before and aim to overwhelm. In the early hours, this is fine, but as the game ramps up and trickier enemies appear, the mechanics can struggle under the pressure of the increased speed and aggression. These enemies often absorb much more damage, have multiple phases, or move around and attack from a distance, and in many cases, there can be multiple of them. Because of this, it can often feel like you're being pulled in multiple directions and cracks in the defensive options form. I often found myself in the middle of a series of attacks and then suddenly an enemy would appear from behind, forcing me to disengage either by turning around or rolling out of the way. The quick turn input is now L1 and down on the directional pad, and even as I approached the end of the game, it felt awkward and unreliable to execute, especially in the heat of battle. You can remap this, but I never found a place where I was completely comfortable with it."
"This also felt like it was breaking the flow of combat, especially since the intensity made it easy to lose track of the on-screen arrow that indicates an attack from behind is coming. The indicator switches from yellow to red to provide some idea of timing, but I still found myself getting clipped a lot. Although this isn't a big deal for much of the game, in the latter half, enemies can stunlock you, so there were numerous occasions where a single enemy would open me up to being pummeled by multiple and I'd die in an instant. These moments arose in a way where I felt ill-equipped and incapable of making Kratos react in a way that could deal with what was being thrown at me, as opposed to not being able to execute because of my own skill. Since there are high-level challenges equivalent to Valkyries from the previous game–and more than a few that are even trickier–this is the kind of thing that can be the difference between life and death. Thankfully, for boss fights at least, God of War Ragnarok is much better about checkpointing as you move through phases. And when you're getting stuck into the combat, Atreus is much more capable this time around. Along with Mimir, he will either do callouts to keep you informed, or fire off some arrows at your command or of his own volition to get threats off you–he's a good lad."
"Ultimately, although these issues can be irksome, they are small and in the grand scheme of things don't drastically impact how the mechanics coalesce. Combat is much pacier and more dynamic than before, and it is thrilling regardless of whether you're fighting a smattering of Draugers or trading blows with gods. It's thoughtfully designed and thoroughly satisfying from the first swing of the axe to the very last."
"Kratos and Atreus's battles takes them across all nine realms, which is a change from the previous game where two of the realms were locked away. One of the most interesting parts of God of War Ragnarok is how it reimagines areas that were in the original game. Fimbulwinter is used as a narrative conceit to give these familiar locales new life. In Norse mythology, Fimbulwinter, which translates to ""the long winter,"" serves as the prelude to Ragnarok. In-game, it affects the nine realms in different ways. Midgard for example is besieged by a bitter cold, so when you return to the Lake of The Nine once again, it has completely frozen over. Key areas of the lake that you may have become intimately familiar with in the last game may now be inaccessible as new parts of it open up. A cold wind sweeps across the icy surface of the lake and at the center of it all, Tyr’s temple is now barely recognizable under the buildup of snow. In the distance, icy mountain peaks serve as a backdrop to a single lighting strike, frozen in place as the mark of an intense battle. Naturally, navigation is completely changed since you can no longer sail the waters. Instead, Kratos and Atreus get around on a sled that is pulled by their trusty pet wolves, which is a nice way to mix up the way you get around. At certain points, you can even use their keen sense of awareness to sniff out objectives, which is a nice touch."
"Svartalfheim, by comparison, looks picturesque from the outskirts, with its bright blue skies. But as you venture deeper into its wetlands, it becomes more desert-like, with craggy rocks awkwardly jutting out and collapsed wooden mining equipment filling the spaces in between. There's an unpleasant, arid atmosphere to it, and yet at the same time, it's quite the visual spectacle to behold, rich in detail and intricate in its construction. Vanaheim, home of the Vanir, is a verdant forest that has reclaimed much of the landscape; trees gently sway in the wind; moss has settled atop the water, and vegetation snakes along stone floors and up onto manmade shrines. And if you take a moment to stop and look around, you'll find wildlife nestled amongst all the green. It's a place that is very alive, which makes it a nice contrast to the coldness of Midgard or the glistening majesty of Alfheim's architecture. There are other areas I won't spoil, some of which have a good amount to see and do, while others serve a specific function."
"No one area in God of War Ragnarok comes across as big as the Lake of the Nine, but it seems like this is a symptom of how you're constantly moving around a variety of locations as opposed to repeatedly returning to one. Regardless, each realm has a grand sense of scale and, as you move between them, the scope of the world as a whole far eclipses what came before. While the main story campaign moves Kratos and Atreus through all nine realms, there are plenty of side quests to undertake in each of these locations. Yet another testament to the writing is that these quests are never a distraction and always present a good reward, whether that be an item or crafting materials, at the very least. However, most of the time they also deliver some piece of lore, further flesh out a side character, or give Kratos, Atreus, and Mimir something new to bond over."
"Going anywhere with these characters is an exciting prospect, and I often found myself just wandering around to let conversations play out or hoping that new ones would start. In most cases, they did, and I was treated to valuable character growth. In Ragnarok, Kratos is now more inquisitive, Mimir is always ready and willing to offer his insight, and Atreus takes the opportunity to make jokes at both their expense. And that's something I definitely didn't expect. God of War Ragnarok is a funny game--there are more than a few laugh-out-loud moments that endeared me to this new family unit that developed over the last game and flourishes in its sequel."
"And that's what distinguishes God of War Ragnarok from its predecessor, and most other action games. Despite being a story about warring gods and the end of the world, the soul of the game is something far more sentimental. You may have noticed that I've avoided mentioning the names of characters or describing plot beats, and that was intentional. To talk more about anything or anyone would be to rob you of some of the most unexpected things that God of War Ragnarok achieves with its narrative and the themes they explore. The last game's thoughtful approach to exploring fatherhood was unexpected, Ragnarok somehow manages to feel like an even more personal tale about the complicated nature of families and the people that make them up. For every moment of brutality, there is one of genuine and relatable emotion. How they land will vary from person to person, but there were multiple that left me with tears welling up. If nothing else, God of War Ragnarok further cements Sony Santa Monica's narrative team as one of the best in the business."
"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom offers a link between the two worlds of Nintendo's iconic action-adventure franchise. It has the playfulness and freeform puzzles of Tears of the Kingdom and the traditional dungeon design the franchise was known for prior to Breath of the Wild's seismic shake-up. Echoes of Wisdom deftly bounces from past to present and establishes its own identity, turning the page to start a new legend for Princess Zelda."
"By now, you're probably well-aware that the major change here is that the franchise namesake is finally the playable character. Technically, the Philips CD-i games The Wand of Gamelon and Zelda's Adventure were the first to do this, but those abysmal games were nothing like Nintendo's Zelda games--they weren't even published by Nintendo. Echoes of Wisdom is the first proper game starring Zelda, which sounds rather ridiculous when you consider the fact that Tingle has starred in three games and a multi-function DSiWare app where you can have your fortune read by the creepiest dude from Hyrule."
"From a narrative perspective, the role reversal makes little impact, largely because Echoes of Wisdom is light on story. A malevolent force is creating rifts across Hyrule that turn residents of Hyrule, including Link and Zelda's father, into statues inside the dark and dreary dimension known as the Still World. Much like how Link was accused of wrongdoing in A Link to the Past, Zelda is accused of creating the rifts and is subsequently imprisoned; you'll even find Wanted posters around Hyrule, this time showing Zelda's face instead of Link's. In her cell, she meets Tri, an ethereal being who accompanies Zelda on her quest and is essentially Zelda's version of Navi from Ocarina of Time. Though some express momentary shock that Zelda is the kingdom's only hope, she is mostly viewed as the one person capable of defeating the evil threatening to consume Hyrule."
"While the rote plot is a hodgepodge of familiar stories, Echoes of Wisdom is more focused on shaking things up from a gameplay standpoint. The shift to playing as Zelda includes markedly different systems for combat, puzzle-solving, and platforming--yes, Echoes of Wisdom has plenty of platforming. Armed with a magical staff given to her by Tri, Zelda can spawn ""echoes,"" copies of objects and enemies you encounter across Hyrule. Outside of bosses, every enemy can be conjured as an echo. Since Zelda is incapable of attacking directly, friendly echo monsters serve as the main form of offense. Each echo has a cost, and going beyond your current max deletes the oldest echoes you created. Because there isn't a cooldown period and you can manually wipe the slate clean at any time, this seemingly passive combat system is far more active and exciting than it initially seems. Once I started racking up echoes and was able to use more at once, I started to enjoy the organized chaos more than any pre-Breath of the Wild combat system."
"Player choice is paramount to the combat system. Much like Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild, there's no ""wrong"" way to vanquish enemies. Do you want to create rocks and hurl them at your enemies repeatedly? You can do that. Command Zirros to spew bombs everywhere? Check. Create a deathring of Pathblades that slice those armored Moblins and Lizalflos while you take a nap on a bed and regenerate health? It's an effective strategy. Zelda does get to wield Link's traditional weapons in Swordfighter Form, though this is tied to an upgradeable energy gauge. When used in combination with echoes, Swordfighter Form is a powerful complementary mechanic that adds another layer to the organized chaos of Echoes of Wisdom's combat."
"Monsters make up the majority of the 127 echoes, but an assortment of inanimate objects combined with Zelda's ability to jump serve as the connective tissue of this thoughtfully designed iteration of Hyrule. Without the Tri Rod, this version of Hyrule simply wouldn't work. Going all-in on one central mechanic really helps Echoes of Wisdom feel markedly different than any other Zelda game. The end result is a top-down Legend of Zelda game with more freedom than ever before."
"Unlike Link in other top-down entries, Zelda doesn't need Roc's Feather/Cape to jump (she should teach him). With this unprecedented ability, you can hide inside of pots and hop around to avoid detection by castle guards in an early stealth sequence that nods back to Ocarina of Time. Much of Echoes of Wisdom's platforming involves building makeshift stairs and bridges. This central concept is taught effectively here with end tables, wooden crates, decorative trees, and the most absurd echo of all: beds. Twin-sized beds can be stacked to form bridges and towers. Seeing four beds stacked across small islands in Lake Hylia or above molten lava in the Fire Temple is a rather curious sight. Even funnier is spawning a bed in the middle of a boss fight to take a nap and gradually restore health."
"Similar to Tears of the Kingdom's Ultrahand rune, Tri can latch onto and move echoes. It's a more rudimentary system, as you can't turn objects and you aren't required to make wonky contraptions with multiple moving pieces. Mostly, you're stacking objects to cross gaps or using echoes to solve puzzles. My favorite and most-used traversal echo was the water block found while helping the Zoras calm down a creature long-time Zelda fans will surely remember. Water blocks can be stacked vertically or horizontally to create towers and tunnels to swim through. It's superb for platforming sequences and solving puzzles, but it's also a great example of the versatility of echoes. Since flying monsters can't live in water, you can create an above-ground pool and drag them in, which kills them instantly. Similarly, you can lure enemies into the flames of torches placed in the center of a room to deal with them. Finding these numerous ways to guide enemies to certain death with the help of echoes is one of the game's many joys."
"The robust echoes system rewards experimentation and encourages exploration. You'll want to pay close attention to your surroundings for objects that sparkle, signifying they can be copied. Trampoline echoes can help you reach areas before upgrading the Tri Rod, and if you're adept at platforming, the disappearing cloud echoes can be used to cross large sections of the map without ever touching the ground. You can also hitch a ride by choosing to follow, rather than guide, monster echoes. For example, birds take you airborne and sharks pull you through strong underwater currents. Although these monsters are now friendly, when you choose to follow them, you are not in control of their movements. Not by default at least. If you poke around, talk to people, and complete side quests, you'll learn new tricks that can fundamentally alter the way you approach platforming sequences and puzzles."
"Nintendo struck a great balance of old and new with Echoes of Wisdom's structure and overarching level design. The lead-up to dungeons takes cues from Tears of Kingdom with multi-part quests, including a trip to the Still World to find Tri's friends and clear the corrupted stretch of land. These scavenger-hunt sequences feel like smaller versions of Tears of the Kingdom's dungeons. Resembling a cross between the Sky Islands and the Depths, the Still World is a shadowy platforming playground with segmented islands and more aggressive monsters. Rifts do an excellent job teaching you the ""rules"" of the region as you approach the dungeon at the end of the darkness."
"Tears of the Kingdom's temples were certainly closer to traditional dungeons than the Divine Beasts from Breath of the Wild, but they still strayed pretty far from the old formula. Echoes of Wisdom's seven dungeons bring back the classic template of multiple floors, automatically shutting doors with rooms full of monsters, small keys to find, and a big chest with the boss key. Besides Hyrule Castle, they retain elemental themes, such as Faron Temple (Forest), Lanyru Temple (Ice), and Jabul Ruins (Water)."
"One of the biggest strengths of these dungeons is how familiar puzzles with ground switches, torches, and other franchise staples feel radically fresh. Instead of finding a new piece of gear to solve puzzles, you utilize new objects and monsters. Even the side-scrolling sections, which were rather straightforward in Link's Awakening and the Oracle games, are clever riddles to solve. Puzzle complexity does a wonderful job of scaling with you. As you progress, the number of echoes you can create at once increases, and the cost of conjuring some of them drops. Despite having the cute toy-like visual style of Link's Awakening, puzzles can get pretty darn challenging. In fact, some of them stumped me for longer than any puzzle in Breath of the Wild or Tears of the Kingdom. Figuring out solutions provided the same satisfaction as solving a really clever logic puzzle. And like all good logic puzzles, you can approach each puzzle from different angles. When comparing strategies with another GameSpot staffer, it was fascinating to see how differently we arrived at solutions."
"Combat isn't as challenging as the pair of open-world Zelda games, but it's possible to get wrecked pretty quickly if you don't spawn monsters that match up well with the enemy, especially in boss fights, which are lengthier and more challenging than dungeon bosses from other top-down Zelda games. Even early bosses, such as the flying mole-like creature wearing sunglasses in the Gerudo Ruins, can be tricky because of its fast underground movements and quicksand that makes some monsters incapable of putting up much of a fight. Though I never died while fighting a boss, I had to heal to stave off the Game Over screen on numerous occasions."
"Classic-style dungeons are flanked by a plethora of side quests a la Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom. While some side quests can be as small as showing an echo to someone, there are numerous high-score-chasing minigames, combat challenges, and errands that require you to explore new areas and solve puzzles. Numerous useful echoes and items are earned through side quests. Borrowing horses from Hyrule Ranch and getting your own are tied to side quests, too. Yes, for the first time, a top-down Zelda game has horseback riding, and the steeds are extremely cute, albeit not super practical. Though probably the largest top-down Zelda game in terms of map size, Echoes of Wisdom has a generous fast-travel system, with multiple warp points in each zone. And since Hyrule is tailored around the echo system, I often found myself abandoning my horse to explore a point of interest inaccessible on horseback."
"Finding hidden collectibles has always been a major component of Zelda games, and Echoes of Wisdom brings back the best collectible of all: Heart Pieces. The return of the signature collectible emphasizes how Echoes of Wisdom represents two eras of Zelda games. There are 40 Heart Pieces scattered throughout Hyrule, and a good chunk of them are obscured by some of the trickiest puzzles on hand. Defeating bosses rewards you with a Heart Container and an upgrade to the Tri Rod. Outside of Heart Pieces, you'll find Might Pieces which can be exchanged for upgrades to Zelda's Swordfighter Form. Some of these are unmissable, but a lot are tied to side quests and exploration, so there's ample incentive to seek these out. The third collectible introduces the weirdest character not named Tingle: Stamp Guy, an obsessive stamp collector, wants you to love stamps as much as he does. I searched for stamps largely to see what he would do after filling up each stamp card. His pure love and devotion needs to be witnessed."
"Multiple other modern new-era series fixtures are adopted by Echoes of Wisdom. It borrows the interactive map system with identical objective markers and reference pins to drop at points of interest. Each area of Hyrule is obscured until you visit it, which is a simple way to remind players exploration is key. The menu and quick-menu structure mirrors those games, too. Scrolling through 100-plus echoes can be somewhat cumbersome, but you can sort them within five different parameters, including most/last used, which helps streamline the process. Instead of cooking meals, you can visit Deku smoothie shops. Mixing materials like fruits and monster parts into a wide selection of drinks lets you replenish hearts and provide stat buffs like resistance to cold, fire, increase dive time, damage resistance. Some materials can only be found by completing certain minigames or by exploring outside of the main questline, offering yet another reason to carefully survey your surroundings. Though Zelda doesn't have as many outfits as Link, there are two main ones and at least a few cute garments earned through side quests and by scanning Amiibo figures."
"If you played the Link's Awakening remake, you already know that Echoes of Wisdom has gorgeous, colorful visuals. Unfortunately, it also shares Link's Awakening's intermittent frame-rate issues, albeit to a lesser extent. It's a larger game with a lot more moving pieces, so it's clear optimizations to the engine were made. Critically, I never noticed slowdown when conjuring echoes--even when throwing eight of them on the map in rapid succession. The slowdown, like Link's Awakening, appears to be tied to rendering the world map."
"Nearly the entire map is accessible from the start, though you'll need to upgrade the Tri Rod to reach collectibles and solve certain puzzles throughout the overworld. Main quests can be completed in the order of your choosing, at least to a certain extent. After the first dungeon, you can head to either Gerudo Desert or Jabul Waters to help the two Zora factions. These first three dungeons (called Ruins) reminded me of Ocarina of Time's Young Link phase. The mid-game dungeon is the same for everyone before opening up with three different paths for the larger temples."
"Being able to explore freely and bounce around between quests for a change of scenery makes Echoes of Wisdom feel like a semi-open-world adventure. Unfortunately, the path I went down in my first playthrough led to a full-on game-breaking bug that placed an invisible barrier at the entrance of Goron City. Since you need to go inside to complete the Eldin Temple main quest, I was left with no choice but to abandon my 35-hour save file, which included numerous hours of troubleshooting without success, and start again. GameSpot informed Nintendo of the bug, and we will update this review if we can confirm it has been fixed. It's worth noting my colleague did not encounter this issue. Though I don't know what caused the bug, here's what I did during my second playthrough: I started the main quest in Kakariko Village and proceeded straight to Goron City before touching any of the optional content in the region."
"With only one dungeon and the final area remaining, the bug required me to make use of the second save slot far sooner than I normally would in a Zelda game. If there's a silver lining to abandoning 35 hours of playtime and starting from scratch, it's that I gained a greater appreciation for the versatility of echoes and developed new strategies that made replaying each dungeon as interesting as the first time, for a different reason. Obviously the thrill of learning how to solve many of the puzzles was gone, but optimizing my play style with learned strategies made me enjoy the second playthrough almost as much as the first. Rather than walking in my own footsteps, I often unconsciously gravitated toward new solutions."
"My total playtime eclipsed 65 hours, but if I had been able to complete the game during my first playthrough, I likely would have rolled credits around the 30-hour mark. It's not Tears of the Kingdom or Breath of the Wild big, but Echoes of Wisdom is larger than many fans would likely expect from a top-down Zelda game."
"If Zelda's debut in the spotlight is a one-off, at least it's a memorable adventure. But hopefully this is the beginning of a new legend for the heroine. Echoes of Wisdom's brilliantly integrated echoes system links two eras, proving that the freeform mechanics of the new age can coexist with the franchise's classic formula. Don't mistake this for a spin-off or minor entry between big ""mainline"" games: The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is a major moment that shouldn't be missed."
"Discovery in video games has changed over the last 40 years. While we are arguably in a golden age of creativity and innovation in the medium, it's a different type of creativity than when games were in their infancy--learning to crawl, grappling for new ideas, and guessing at best practices. Modern-day games have become largely standardized, and that's mostly for the better. But when we look back at retro game collections like the NES Classic or compilations from Digital Eclipse, we're often remembering the trailblazers, not the oddballs. That's what makes UFO 50 so special--it invokes the sense of wild experimentation and surprise that you would find in a cross-section of the earliest video games."
"The pitch is simple: UFO 50 is a compilation of fictional retro games made throughout the 1980s by a prolific developer called UFO Soft. They range from 1982 to 1989, and span across the entire gamut of retro genres. The presentation leans into this, as selecting a game for the first time has you blowing the dust off of it. You get the sense that you discovered these forgotten gems in an attic or garage sale. And for the most part, the games carry the design and story aesthetic that was common in '80s games, which I would describe as ""sci-fi pulp as reimagined by early computer programmers."""
"In reality, of course, the games were created by a team of modern-day developers led by Spelunky's Derek Yu. That makes the decision to make not just a retro game but 50 retro games remarkably ambitious. One would expect such a massive undertaking to result in minigames at most, but that is not the case. These are almost universally the size and scope of actual games you would buy in the 1980s--still often smaller than the games we'd expect today, but not compromised for their fictional time period."
"And while UFO 50 doesn't tell a straightforward narrative story, there is a lot of richness to be found in the meta-fiction of UFO Soft. You see the logo changing over time. The games themselves get more complex and more refined, and have better art direction and better quality-of-life features, over the fictional timeline. The games themselves have little notes about their development, and you can piece together criss-crossing plotlines involving the studio's personalities and leadership. The occasional sequel will appear, showing an early style of iterative development that might result in radically different gameplay styles springing from the same core concepts. One of the games--a point-and-click adventure called Night Manor--has glimpses of the early cinematic achievement that you could see being influential in the fiction of the world."
"Like a lot of early games, the simplicity of the controls means you more-or-less figure out the game by playing. This can be slightly frustrating sometimes, especially when a game ventures into territory with more complex, board game-like mechanics, like Devilition. Others, like Mooncat, have strange and counterintuitive controls that I struggled to get a proper feel for. This is realistic in that a lot of old video games tried to approximate board-game complexity or experiment with control schemes, but the wealth of other games to play made it difficult to remain patient with those more inscrutable ones."
"Despite basing themselves around retro games, though, most of these have some special twist or feature that makes them stand out from similar games of their genre. You can mark a game as a favorite for easy reference later, and as I reached further and the games grew more refined, I kept marking more and more of them, eager to go back and experience them all to their fullest. And while UFO 50 is very casual in how it lets you approach the games in any order, there is a reward for delving deeply into each one--you get rewards to place in your garden for an achievement in each game, along with a golden cartridge for finishing it."
"To give a taste, here are mini-reviews of some of my favorites in the compilation:"
Mortol
"This puzzle platformer gives you an array of peons willing to sacrifice themselves for the greater good, making your resources and lives draw from the same large pool. Each one can perform a ""ritual"" to stick into walls, turn into a stone block, or blow up passages, so you progress through the stage by carefully managing when and how to sacrifice them to keep progressing further. It was followed by a sequel, Mortol II, later in the collection, which includes a more sophisticated class-based system for utilizing your willing sacrifices, but there's something very pure and engaging about the original idea."
Bushido Ball
"A dodgeball-meets-fighting game with a selection of samurai characters to choose from. You smack the projectiles with your katana to ricochet it back at the other side, and on top of requiring precision timing, each character has their own special abilities, providing lots of replay value and room for skill-building."
Camouflage
"Camouflage is a brilliant little puzzle game with a root in stealth mechanics. As a largely helpless chameleon, you need to navigate to your home while avoiding watchful predators. But being a chameleon, you can change your colors to match the tile you're standing on. That makes navigating through a stage a tense exercise in planning your route to pick up new camouflage patterns. For extra challenge, each stage has collectibles to pick up, including a baby chameleon who will follow you around and pick up its own camouflage pattern, thus doubling the challenge."
Party House
"Possibly my favorite surprise of the bunch, Party House is an ingenious puzzle game with mechanics similar to modern deck-builders. You're given a strict number of turns to throw a series of parties, and you control the guest list. Each guest comes with bonuses to your cash and popularity--cash expands your house, and popularity goes toward inviting new guests. Some guests have ""Troublemaker"" attributes that will attract the cops, while others might sacrifice some popularity for cash, or vice-versa. Dancers stack as a multiplier for popularity. One party-goer even brings a random friend who risks overloading your party and summoning the fire marshall to kick someone out."
"The party commences, a random assortment of your rolodex of party-goers shows up, and you tabulate your cash and popularity to put toward the next party, all while steering toward some particular win condition like having four aliens attend a single party. It's shockingly compelling, and easy to keep the party going for just one more turn late into the night."
The Big Bell Race
"The is one of the shortest games of the collection but also one most suited to multiplayer. The Big Bell Race is pure game mechanics: You're a spaceship navigating through a boxy maze-like racetrack while bouncing off the other racing ships and grabbing power-ups that create track hazards for your competitors. A single tournament is eight quick races, but the competition can be fierce, and you can always play two-player to bump elbows against a friend."
Warptank
"At first glance, Warptank appears similar to the classic Blaster Master tank segments, but it's the ""warp"" in the name that really sets it apart. At any point, your tank can flip from floor to ceiling or to opposing walls. Navigating a stage is a delicate balance of avoiding traps and taking out enemies by frequently gaining access to new vantage points, giving it a fierce action-game feeling that also tickles your brain."
Vainger
"This metroidvania-like platformer has a hook similar to Warptank, but the application of it in this genre makes it feel very different. As an alien soldier, you can swap the gravity polarity by double-tapping the jump button, so all of the traps and enemies are positioned to take advantage of stages that could be upside-down at any time. The result is something like the second quest of Symphony of the Night in a reversed castle, except you control when the whole thing flips on its head."
Pingolf
"Lots of early games tried to approximate sports like golf, but Pingolf is a more modern take with a sci-fi aesthetic. The side-scrolling stages are set up like platforming stages with some elements of pinball, with narrow corners and bounce pads. It feels not quite like anything else, though the closest analogue is probably the recent Cursed to Golf."
Fist Hell
"It wouldn't be a retro-style compilation without a River City Ransom riff, but Fist Hell sets itself apart with fantastic pixel art and an engaging hook: zombies! You're taking on the hordes of the undead with nothing but your fists and found objects, which leads to neat twists like lopping the skull off of one zombie and throwing it at another. It's the kind of comical early gore that felt daring in the '80s, and with four characters to choose from, there's lots of replay value."
Valbrace
"Another surprising favorite from a genre I haven't had much experience with, Valbrace is a first-person dungeon-crawling RPG, similar to Dungeon Master or Wizardry 2. The presentation is top-notch for emulating the peculiar, pixelated look of those dungeon crawlers, and when you encounter monsters, you enter a more active real-time third-person combat system. What really helps it stand out, though, is the magic system, which maps spells onto a particular pattern drawn with your D-pad. You discover those spells as you proceed through the dungeon, but even if you die, the spell pattern will still work on your next run. That means if you can remember the spells--or map them onto graph paper--you'll make each subsequent run that much easier."
Rakshasa
"A side-scrolling action game along the lineage of Ghosts & Goblins, this one has you taking on hordes of demons with a unique revival mechanic. You're extremely vulnerable to attacks and bound to die, but each time you die, you can recover your life by navigating around the demons of the spiritual plane. Each time you die, more demons are added, making it increasingly difficult--but not impossible--to recover your body."
Star Waspir
"This is less of a retro genre reimagined, and more of an anachronistic take on the bullet hell. Lots of shoot-'em-ups graced the NES and its similarly powered consoles, but Star Waspir has the tense risk-reward dynamic of populating constant power-ups that are just temptingly close to enemy fire. It's the kind of tough, responsive combat that has made the genre such a hit, given new context through a retro filter."
Grimstone
"An old-school JRPG-style game set in a fantastical version of the Old West, Grimstone begins as an angel rescues a handful of adventurers from a burning saloon, who then form a posse to go after outlaws. The aesthetic is reminiscent of the earliest Final Fantasy games, but its setting and a timing-based combat system gives it a modern twist."
Lords of Diskonia
"What if a strategy game got a dose of air hockey? Lords of Diskonia has you collect income from villages and use it to buy an army of knights, archers, champions, and more, and then take them into battle. But far from a typical warzone, your soldiers here are differently sized circular disks who get fired into and bump against enemy units to attack. It's a wildly different take on the strategy genre and feels tactical and dynamic at once."
Cyber Owls
"The final game of the collection is also a smart, cheeky commentary on the prominence of Turtle-mania in the late '80s, and the efforts from just about every cartoon studio or video game developer to make their own franchise-friendly animals with attitude. Cyber Owls is the kind of game you'd see then, with an elite band of owl soldiers, each with their own stages to match their specialty--from beat-'em-up to stealth action. It's probably the single most varied game of the set, and one of the most cinematic, serving as a perfect bookend to the fictional journey of game development throughout the decade."
"Simply put, UFO 50 is an audacious triumph. Dozens of the games are compelling enough to warrant a full playthrough, and even some of the less successful experiments have some intriguing element or inventive idea to draw you in. Best of all, it's exciting to have such a rich vein of strange, creative video game experiences to examine. This is nostalgia, but not the candy-coated feeling of reliving what we've already experienced. It's remembering how it felt to discover something new."
"As a high schooler in 2006, I spent many months and what little money I had renting screen time with an Xbox 360 in a mall store that had dozens of TVs and consoles available for use at hourly rates. Several visits and two years later, I'd saved up enough money to buy myself the console, no longer willing to be only a part-time player of the game I'd wanted: Capcom's Dead Rising. Nearly 20 years since then, it's been entertaining to discover that it still holds up as an endearing, open-world zombie game that undoubtedly has its flaws. Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster isn't a new entry in the series I hope we one day get, but it's a fun return to the roots of a series that has a unique voice and, for better or worse, strange design choices."
"Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster (DRDR) is not a remake. The title should give that away, but the line between remake and remaster has been blurred as of late, so I stress that as a means to explain that this game is, in most major ways, the same as it was. Changes come largely in the form of quality-of-life fixes and a welcome visual overhaul, but the bones of the original game--the dimensions of its mall setting, the tonally chaotic cutscenes, the feel of protagonist Frank West's wrestling moves and melee attacks--that's all as it was before. This puts a cap on the game's appeal in 2024, as several of its systems were awkward even in 2006, and have aged poorly since."
"Essentially playing as Capcom's other zombie saga alongside the much older Resident Evil, and a darkly comedic take on Romero's Dawn of the Dead, Dead Rising is about a zombie outbreak that begins in a mall in Willamette, Colorado. Photojournalist Frank West, a self-serious investigator whom you can nonetheless dress up in a significant number of absurd costumes, arrives to look into the matter, then gets trapped in the mall with dozens of other human survivors. Surrounded by hordes of the undead whenever he steps out of the safe room, his mission is to determine the cause of the zombie plague, survive the outbreak until rescue arrives, and save as many others as he can."
"Sometimes, this means following a mission marker toward signs of commotion, where Frank might find a survivor or several holed up in the back of a jewelry store or supermarket. He'll need to escort them back to the safe room, leading to frustration as the NPCs make for unreliable escort missions. They're bad at finding a path through the undead and tend to get grabbed or slashed. Thankfully, you can arm and heal them along the way, but a limited inventory system means you'll often juggle bringing what you need to lead the pack and what the pack needs to follow you toward their salvation."
"This is the most glaring of the game's original pain points that reappears due to DRDR being only a remaster and not a remake. Though the game offers several welcome fixes to be discussed later in this review, the survivability of NPC allies is not among them. As a photojournalist, Frank has covered wars, but in this mall, he's babysitting."
"Sometimes, you'll come upon desperate survivors merely by chance or through exploration--the game won't tell you of their whereabouts in your mission log, but you might hear them crying out while slicing zombies in half with a katana at the faux Starbucks. Dead Rising's tone is constantly shifting. It's not so much that it's at war with itself; that phrasing implies conflict. Instead, it feels purpose-built to be all over the emotional map. You won't find a truly gut-wrenching moment in the story--due to how corny most characters are, it's unlikely you'll feel for anyone in such a deep manner--but you'll find plenty of somberness."
"Some missions play out with the seriousness of a murder charge, while others unfold with spin-kicks and cheesy dialogue that would feel at home in a B-movie. Even the game's photography mechanics, which let you take great pics for XP (or ""PP,"" as this game calls it) reward you for taking dramatic and horrific photos, like people being eaten alive, but also comedic pictures, too, such as images of zombies you've forced into costumes. Ultimately, this blend of tones comes out of the wash as something closer to the absurd. Even when it's hinting at seriousness, Dead Rising is ridiculous, and it's better for it."
"This is never more evident than it is with the game's many bosses, who are called psychopaths. Each of them is found in different parts of the mall at different times throughout the story, and they tend to personify some element of United States culture that the developers pick on through these over-acted caricatures of people, even when the real-life issues may be much more deserving of solemnity. A family of hunters who turn their attention to human targets hits on America's uniquely problematic gun culture. A power-tripping cop takes hostages in a women's clothing store, abusing the victims in a strange funhouse mirror reflection of real-life issues. A war vet suffering from PTSD can't separate real life from his haunting memories."
"None of these characters says anything meaningful in the end, though it also doesn't feel like the studio has missed its intended mark; they all feel like cartoonish displays of America's worst attributes, and that's all. Any commentary anyone wishes to add to them feels like it's not in the game's text or subtext. One could contribute thousands of words on this design decision and any good or harm it may do, but ultimately it feels like Capcom is merely shitposting, so why bother? I find them neither offensive nor insightful. In some cases, I'm sure they'd be handled differently today, but I mainly just find them loud and silly."
"These NPCs, hidden characters, and bosses combine with the game's universal timer system to make a perfect run of the game--completing all missions, saving all survivors, and killing all bosses--either exciting or maddening, depending on what you're into. For my taste, achieving this is more pain than pleasure, given some of the game's yet-to-be-mentioned flaws, though here in the remaster I found I don't mind the timer itself as much as I used to. Essentially, the game is constantly aware of its day-night cycle. Hours don't tick by in real-time, but they do tick by at a rate consistent in its world, so you can reliably plan ahead as you carve out routes through the hordes and missions slowly evaporate off your quest log forever if you don't complete them in time."
"Secret shortcuts can be found, and vehicles, as poor as their controls still feel 18 years later, can be driven across the expansive courtyard between mall sections. There's ultimately one optimal, rigid path through the 12-hour game that will allow you to make excellent use of your time so you can see and do everything, and finding it was once a communal effort. Today these answers are widely available online since the internet optimized all of this nearly 20 years ago, and though newcomers who may have enjoyed those group brainstorm sessions can't really partake in them anymore, it's also true that players frustrated by such a setup can smooth over these rough parts more easily."
"Dead Rising has an uncommon crowdsourcing aspect to it, which makes it a fascinating game despite its faults. You have to know when to look for the survivors you're not warned about. You learn, via comment sections on GameFAQs threads that would be old enough to drive, when you should bring a train of NPCs with you to some other section of the mall to grab an important item for a soon-to-be-needy survivor stashed in your safe room, or when to beeline it for that safe room because a powerful trio of bosses roaming in a humvee will soon spawn in the courtyard, and they'll almost surely run over your allies if you give them the chance. You can learn these things on your own, but you'll probably learn them the hard way."
"All of this also ties into the game's roguelite element, which is technically optional but likely to be used at least once or twice in any playthrough. Whenever Frank dies, you can elect to reload your last save or start from the very beginning of the game while keeping his level and skills intact. Early on, Frank is slow, devoid of helpful attack moves, and has little in the way of health or inventory space, making some missions extremely difficult to beat on a single run. It can be done, but your best bet is to reset the story with a sturdier Frank. That's true for a standard run in which you'd just like to beat the game, but especially for those seeking the flawless playthrough."
"This was an uncommon approach in 2006 and feels even stranger today, given how popular roguelites have become. Dead Rising doesn't do much with this one aspect of the genre, and though it's very helpful to restart the story once you think you've hit your limit at your current level, it's easy to imagine how a modern take on this game would either remove this system completely or make it more robust and interesting."
"Sometimes, force-multiplying these frustrations are its uneven combat systems. On one hand, being left in a mall in which virtually everything is a weapon is such an awesome video game premise. You can scavenge for guns, blades, and baseball bats, or you can chuck trash cans, benches, and tables at the shambling undead. Similarly, you can heal with an impressive number of food items like gallons of orange juice and coffee creamer, or whole pies and two-foot baguettes, all of which Frank consumes in a few swift, cartoonish gulps a la Scooby-Doo."
"There are also a great number of novelty weapons, some of which, like the world itself, offer secrets that make them better-performing. An early boss drops the best weapon in the game once he's defeated, and after that, it permanently respawns by the mall's roller coaster whenever you want another one of them to counter the game's durability system. But if you equip this weapon while also stashing three specific skill-boosting magazines in your inventory, collected from various stores around the mall, the weapon's durability improves exactly 27 times over, making just one of them effectively the only weapon you need for the entire game."
"As a result, this weapon is sort of game-breaking--at the very least, it removes the emphasis on scavenging for new tools like you're meant to--but since the combat is choppy and prone to seeing you whiff on a move only to have your throat eaten, I find it to be the best way to play. The way zombies slowly chase you once you're within their sight means you'll constantly have to serpentine through crowds to try and improve your ability to dodge their attacks. Quicktime events (QTE) occur when you're grabbed, and though they're easy enough to escape, they're also so common that traversing the mall can become death by a thousand cuts if you haven't pocketed a few gallons of OJ or several ears of corn."
"Dead Rising's zombies have a knack for snatching you when you're vulnerable, like in the second between when you grab a shopping cart--which slightly improves movement speed--and when you can actually pick up enough speed to glide around the parking garage with it. More often, it's the brief moment following a dive ability, which Frank can only perform every five seconds or so, when another zombie will grab him and remove a pip of health even if you've passed the QTE."
"Beyond basic melee attacks and guns, Frank also unlocks a number of maneuvers performed on the controller with short chains of button presses that have been overhauled to be easier to do. These further paint the world in absurdity. As I leveled up, I unlocked moves such as standing on the shoulders of zombies like a crowd-surfing rockstar, a soccer-style bicycle kick that whacks zombie heads clean off their shoulders, and disemboweling the undead with a gnarly gut punch like something out of The Boys. Eventually, I could even perform moves that are yanked right out of pro wrestling, like a bulldog and a German suplex."
"None of these moves is very effective in clearing a horde given they can usually only harm one zombie of the several dozen that may be near you at any point, but some of them prove their usefulness in specific moments, like a jump-kick that can get a zombie to stop chewing on an ally without significantly hurting the ally themselves."
"It may sound like I have a lot of qualms about a game I praised to open this review, but many of its quirks and even some of its flaws ultimately make Dead Rising special, too. While it's annoying to be caught in a zombie's clutches because of stilted attacks or movement, such a moment unfolds in a mall playing once-cheery Muzak on a loop as zombies dressed in giant Servbot heads trip into fountains or reach toward Frank--who may by then be dressed as a child, Mega Man, or the mall's bee mascot--from the other side of a smoothie bar. The world is consistently ridiculous in its sights and sounds, and its gameplay woes often fall by the wayside as a result. This isn't true for a late-game enemy type that is more frustrating than I remembered (and won't spoil), but otherwise, Dead Rising is like an adorable puppy that pooped on the carpet; I can't easily stay mad at it."
"That's truer in the Deluxe Remaster version than ever before, because though the total package of Dead Rising has aged to be a worse game than it was in 2006, this is also clearly, and perhaps paradoxically, the best version of the game. Several quality-of-life changes have provided the conveniences the open-world genre normally affords players. Frank can now move and shoot simultaneously, which was annoyingly outside his capabilities in the original game. A compass at the top of the screen now helpfully points you toward the optimal route, even adjusting to reflect optional shortcuts once you've unlocked them. Meters inform you of a weapon's remaining durability, removing the guessing game from this mechanic like the original had."
"Arguably, the most important aspect is the ability to advance time, which allows you to speed up those smaller chunks of time between when you've done all you want to and when the next main mission unlocks in the game's universal timer. For perfectionists, this also helps you min-max Frank through early playthroughs so you can climb to level 50 faster and perform the perfect run. It's worth noting, however, you still don't choose what upgrades you unlock. Instead, each upgrade, be it a speed boost, another inventory slot, a wrestling move, or something else, is tied to a specific level. That seems like an additional detail a new Dead Rising would rightly redesign, but in 2024's remaster, it's another head-scratcher in a game full of sometimes-charming design conundrums."
"My favorite of the game's changes, however, is so simple and yet so welcome: auto-saves. Before, if you didn't go to a restroom to save your game and then you died, you'd lose everything you'd done since your last save--though you'd at least keep your level for the roguelite reset option. Because saving took you off the path you were on at times, this also ate into your available time. Now, the game saves whenever you transition from one section of the world to another, like when you exit the safe room or move from the North Plaza to the supermarket, keeping you on track and being much less punishing if you've failed to save for a while."
"All of these new elements make the game clearly better than the original version, which I'd say is also true of the visual overhaul. Moving to Capcom's proprietary RE Engine, DRDR adopts newer Resident Evil games' touch of sepia tones, which alters the game's overall color palette in a way that may have some video game preservationists up in arms. I don't mind it though, as it's ultimately pretty subtle unless you compare the versions side-by-side and notice some blue hues swapped for shades of tan. Along with that, the modern conveniences like much better textures and stronger facial animations mean the game looks modern, though Frank's facial features have been made a bit harsher for some reason. His newly furrowing brow makes him look much grumpier than he is, though that isn't to say he's not grumpy."
"Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is a better version of a classic, flawed game. Those blemishes are sometimes more glaring today, but some great fixes to the overall package also erase some other issues entirely. Its timeless qualities, like an absurd story and a fun setting, keep it from feeling like an unwelcome retread. Still, I'd hope the next Dead Rising fixes a lot of what this one does poorly--and even some of its sequels did that, so it seems likely. In 2024, Dead Rising is no longer the sort of game that would make me run out and buy a new console, but it is a game that I'm happy to revisit in this improved form."
"Frostpunk 2 is a compelling, while cynical, view of survival, and a challenging strategy game that sets itself apart from its contemporaries in the city-building genre. Did I feel good watching a city I had developed over the course of nine in-game years start to come apart at the seams, despite having a stockpile of resources to survive for years to come? No. But Frostpunk 2 taught me that I'm not supposed to feel good about it. Instead, it conditioned me to accept that, no matter my best-laid plans, unifying a society with a shared vision of the future was a fool's errand."
"Like the first Frostpunk, this sequel is a survivalist city builder that sees you managing your resources to, hopefully, thrive in a world that's been frozen over and where fatal storms loom on the horizon, all while navigating the harrowing needs of the planet's last known survivors. Surviving mother nature's greatest woes is one thing, but surviving human nature is the true adversary. This means that while you build a city, you're also building the values of society's future, creating two distressing challenges to juggle at once. Governing the laws and vision of the future was a defining characteristic of the first Frostpunk, and what separated it from other city builders of the genre at the time--Frostpunk 2 is a natural evolution of that."
"Taking place 30 years after the events of its predecessor, Frostpunk 2 starts with the captain dead, and the city needing to grow and go on without him. You play as a steward, less a leader like the first game's captain, and more a mediator for the needs of the city and its people. No longer can you simply pass a law to replace food with sawdust--as a steward, passing that law means taking it to a council made up of the city's communities where its enactment is determined by a vote."
"Being made an agent between parties rather than a ruler is what makes Frostpunk 2 a significantly different experience from the first, and in doing so, makes it an excellent entry point for new players. While both games share the same values of building a city and navigating human nature by way of forming laws and societal views, Frostpunk 2 carries over very little in moment-to-moment gameplay from the first, making much of the city-building, law passing, and technological research completely new and its own."
"Taking position as a mediator is itself a unique take in a genre that's repeatedly put players in a god-like position to dictate and create. Frostpunk 2 strips that power from you, and asks you to pick sides, or in most cases, the lesser of several evils, in order to sustain a functioning society. It's the change in power dynamic that cements Frostpunk 2's themes best, and makes it more a meditation in accepting that you can not, and will not, please everyone. This is a theme that existed in the first, but the depth of its exploration pales in comparison to how its successor puts it at the forefront."
"Trudging through morally despicable areas is familiar territory for returning Frostpunk players, whether that's instilling child labor or allowing public executions, but Frostpunk 2 makes these choices less black and white, and expands them into grayer tones by way of complex and layered social systems."
"In Frostpunk 2, you keep track of how your city is faring through trust and tension, as opposed to the first game's hope and discontent. Trust is indicated with a bar at the bottom of the screen, while tension is depicted using a Schlenk flask that will bubble and boil as societal unrest rises. If you make too many disagreeable choices then the trust of your citizens diminishes, giving you a short window of time to gain it back before you're exiled. The same happens if tension boils over from crime, squalor, disease, and hunger. Thing is, the basic necessities of a human's existence, whether it's shelter, food, or heat, are only a small facet of the myriad of other factors that determine your success as a steward in Frostpunk 2. This time, you must uphold relations with the city's communities too."
"Several communities can form in your city, each with their own set of morals, beliefs, and ideologies. While some communities will have overlapping values, each one still has a distinct view of what is best for the city. The Machinists beliefs, for example, are founded on technology being the path to a better future. The Lords, on the other hand, reject the advancement of technology and believe in upholding the traditions of life before the world fell to the ice age. The addition of communities paint a clear image of how this world has developed since the first, which gave weight to the world and its ongoing progression. If you build your city on the values of one community more than the other, then members of that community may split off to form a radicalized faction based on those beliefs, becoming an extremist borough all its own. The game features several communities, with each playthrough orienting around three at any given time. In addition, there are numerous factions that can form within each community, many of which I'm still discovering. All of them have their own influence on the choices you make to develop your city, so the level of complexity is high and the balance tricky to strike."
"While many games often put you in a position where you can still succeed by choosing to back a sole faction, it's not quite as cut-and-dry in Frostpunk 2. Balancing the needs and beliefs of a faction is like tending a flickering flame so you don't set your house ablaze. Or, in this case, your city. As previously mentioned, if a faction's views are rejected enough, they'll protest and that will raise tension. But on the other end, if they're favored too much, a devout cult-like following will begin to form, halting even your ability to mitigate the city's next development. As a player, I had no tolerance in supporting a radicalized group that teetered on fascist totalitarian beliefs, but despite rejecting its proposed laws or demands, I was faced with knowing they lived among my city and sat in my council‘s chairs. It created a rigid scenario for me to navigate and, knowing outwardly I couldn't simply banish them, I was forced to strategically play the long game in building up my own forces and prisons for when the inevitable protests began. This balance and power struggle made for exhilarating and stressful planning that got under my skin. Even when I wasn't playing Frostpunk 2, I would be scheming on how to tackle the next challenge or planning five steps ahead while going about my daily routine."
"Communities and factions are the backbone of the game's densely interwoven systems, where every decision you make, from the buildings you erect, to the laws you pass and the ideas you research, weaves a web of permutations and possibilities. Each choice you make sets off a chain reaction that paves the way to new laws, ideas, and opportunities, as well as conflicts. Support a community that values economy and tradition, and new ideas to support those agendas emerge. However, equally, you close the door on potentially developing technology to better withstand the next harsh storm. Understanding how it all interlocks together is a steep learning curve that took me the entirety of the game's 15-hour story, but once understood, the game's impressive overlapping system of consequences is fully revealed, and opens up a tremendous amount of opportunity for experimentation that kept me coming back for more, no matter how sad this game can at times make me feel about humanity."
"Every decision you make is put into context thanks to micro-stories that arise while you overlook your growing metropolis--a returning feature from the first. After a law was passed that proposed that all mothers don't work to instead raise their children as their sole responsibility, I was prompted with a choice from an angry husband who found out she spent her free time writing a novel. Either I destroyed the novel and increased relations with the communities that supported the law, or let her keep it, slightly raising the trust meter among the population. I let her keep it, and eventually I learned she finished it, and dedicated it to the steward. There's several of these tiny stories that pop-up, grounding you in the choices you're making and forcing you to look at the repercussions of your actions, for better or worse. It constantly feeds into the chain of events, and cause-and-effect of how the game is designed, and that shows even in its city building."
"Building something as necessary as a research center to develop your city's ideas requires a series of actions, including breaking the ice to create a suitable foundation, building a housing district, and then expanding that district to enable a building slot in which you can place a research center. And each action requires a workforce and resources to fulfill. Building a hospital, for example, requires the idea to be researched, which can be done by any one community (which in-turn supports their ideologies), and that also requires the housing district to be expanded again before actually building the hospital. This is a small glimpse at the many variables of interconnected hurdles to manage and think ahead about. It can feel head-swelling, but as I came to understand Frostpunk 2's interconnected systems, it was equally inspiring to approach the cascading set of possibilities and maximize my strategy. It's that complexity, as head spinning as it can feel, that makes Frostpunk 2 an excellent sandbox for strategy."
"Similarly, the staggering amount of laws to explore and the process in passing them requires careful consideration. Taking a law to council will see you navigating each community and faction, the process for which can vary based on the variables of your playthrough. At one point in my playthrough, passing a law meant negotiating between three communities and two factions at any given time. There are dozens upon dozens of laws split up between four categories--survival, city, society, and rule--with three sub-categories and several proposals in each one. It's a lot. Even with dozens of hours in-game, I've yet to explore or see them all. Each law has its own effect, whether it's requiring the sick to quarantine (which increases shelter demand), or making the sick wear a badge that identifies them as ""infectious"" (which raises tension). Both laws support a different community's values, and enacting the one you think is best requires negotiating with undecided parties."
"Negotiating, in of itself, carries its own burden, as it requires making a promise to an undecided community. These promises can come by way of proposing a law they want, or even repealing one that currently exists. Or maybe it means simply paying them off."
"There is a lot going on in Frostpunk 2, and it involves navigating a lot, and I mean a lot, of menus, as well as blocks of text to digest all of its rules and systems. It took me hours to confidently maneuver through the many menus within menus, which are a necessity to the game's layered design. It's hard to view it as a criticism, as I think its menu navigation is a best-case scenario, all things considered, but I can see it being a barrier of entry for some players, even returning ones."
"To Frostpunk 2's credit, it does a good job of including text boxes and expandable tutorials over nearly every significant prompt and decision, which alleviates a lot of going back and forth by arming you with clear information and context. Even still, there are a number of occasions where I was prompted that I couldn't enact a specific building's perk, like rolling out guards for a protest, without having passed a specific law, and the game didn't tell me where that law was located among the many tabs of other laws, or what it specifically did. A link directly to that law would have been a nice quality-of-life feature to alleviate some friction. I did eventually find where that law was, but it came too late after having spent resources on another solution to the problem at hand."
"It can be easy to get caught up in the minutia of navigating politics and making sure your city has all it needs to thrive; watching its streets flicker to life as it grows into a steampunk metropolis from a bird's-eye view. Between all the law-passing and stressful decision-making, expanding your metropolis is a rewarding achievement made tangible through a visual feast. Frostpunk 2 evolves one of the first's most distinct traits, and that is its unrelentingly dour and gray aesthetic. Frostpunk 2, while still chilling to the bone to look at, adds a much needed dose of color to its buildings, giving each district its own aesthetic, whether it's the housing district coated in blue paint, or the green brushed onto the industrial food extraction districts. It all gives an extra layer of personality, which is especially welcomed since you're able to zoom into a district, where you can occasionally spot some of your workers making snow angels. Details like this add the smallest glimpse of needed levity to a world that otherwise feels so depressing."
"Exploring the frostland--the frozen land beyond your city limits--has also received some upgrades from the first, as now finding resources requires building connecting trailways back to your city. It also adds opportunities to set up additional colonies, which act like miniature versions of your city from which you can transport goods (just in case managing one city wasn't difficult enough). It's a necessary challenge as resources around your city--like coal, food, and materials--only provide enough to get your city started. It's imperative to explore the frostland to thrive and survive, but unlocking more areas of the overmap can get bogged down by a camera that doesn't zoom out enough to get the full lay of the land. Navigating the frostland and keeping track of outposts and planning ahead for future expeditions was accompanied by what felt like unnecessary stress due in part to its camera, making an already dense and convoluted game harder to manage."
"After the credits rolled, I realized that there was still so much I hadn't quite understood, and that's only a side-effect to the nature of the game's intricate design. It's in Utopia mode, the game's endless mode, where its replayability and experimentation take full form. It's here where you can try your hand at developing a city in different scenarios of varying sizes and resources, whether that's to expand out into the frostland or create a heavily populated metropolis. The game also has spectacular difficulty customization, allowing you to change the variables of economy, weather, frostland, and society, making it a dream to tailor your experience how you see fit. Though I completed the story in 15 hours, I've doubled that in Utopia mode alone, and have several experiments of different difficulties and scenarios happening across several save files."
"Frostpunk 2 doesn't replace the first game. Instead, it elevates its rawest themes of human nature to towering heights. It offers a significantly different challenge in its city-building that allows both games to exist in separate sectors of the genre, and it's better for it."
"Developer 11 Bit Studios continues to follow a theme with each consecutive game, starting with its breakout success This War of Mine. With Frostpunk 2, 11 Bit Studios has built its systems and mechanics around asking you to make inconceivably difficult choices, most of which only lead to the best-case scenario, not the right one. Frostpunk 2 is a great step forward in both studios' evolution and the survival/city-building genre it helped pioneer."
"The Plucky Squire is a game that will rightly receive a lot of attention for its eye-catching visual gimmick, which merges the worlds of 2D and 3D art around a clever story hook. But more than just its whizbang artistry, The Plucky Squire is a game that takes full advantage of its premise--telling a kid-friendly and heartfelt story, filling its well-realized world with lovable characters, and delivering constant surprises. It is a reminder, appropriately, to never judge a book by its cover."
"You play as Jot, the titular ""Plucky Squire"" in a series of children's books of the same name. The series of picture books is popular enough to have inspired a large fan base and merch, which is absolutely believable given how playful and inviting it is. While Jot himself is the classic silent protagonist, the surrounding cast of characters are exuberant and frequently funny, and the world of Mojo itself, which the characters occupy, is colorful and imaginative."
"Over time, the game reveals itself in layers of complexity. You begin playing through what appears to be a standard top-down adventure game, with the neat visual flourish that screen changes and cutscenes are marked by turning pages of the book. Before long though, the book's recurring villain, Humgrump, reveals his dastardly plan: the ability to kick Jot out of the book altogether. You're ejected forcefully out of the book and into the real world. That reveals the second layer, as Jot finds his way back into the book and then gains the power to jump in and out at will, using special ""Metamagic"" portals. When he jumps out of the book he roams around the desk of Sam, a 10-year-old boy who loves the Plucky Squire books."
"I can't overstate how magical and seamless the transition feels between the two realities. When Jot and his friends are occupying the book, there is a lovely 2D visual language that would be at home in a real-life picture book, complemented by smooth animations and varied behaviors that bring all the characters to life. When Jot jumps out of the book, he magically transforms into a Rankin-Bass model of his 2D self, and the perspective shifts downward for a closer look. The two art styles look beautiful in their own right, while also being visually cohesive with each other. As you gain more abilities you're able to bring things from the outside world back into the book with you, and they have their own similar transition to the 2D plane."
"The story of a protagonist being ousted from his own book, then finding his way back and chasing after the villain, would be compelling enough on its own. But The Plucky Squire adds extra emotional heft by establishing early that you're not just fighting for the fate of your own storybook. You're Sam's favorite book, his favorite hero, and you inspire him to draw his own characters and imagine his own worlds. You can see evidence of how much he loves Jot and the world of Mojo all over his room when you explore his desk. If Humgrump wins, it's not just Jot's world at risk, but Sam's future as a budding artist and writer as well."
"Structurally, The Plucky Squire behaves like a mash-up of a 2D and 2.5D Zelda game, albeit with puzzle elements that revolve around the book-jumping gimmick, as you'll frequently have to jump in and out of the book to manipulate your environment. Since this is a story book, your activities are constantly being narrated, and sometimes even the words on the pages themselves must be manipulated for puzzle solving."
"One moment you may be rearranging the words on the page to change an impassable barrier into a broken gate. A few minutes later and you're hopping outside of the book, trying to find an object that can help you inside the story. Sometimes you'll need to flip back a few pages to find a missing word you need to complete a word-puzzle. Occasionally the book will even change perspective, turning on its side to present a piece of the stage that is more vertically oriented."
"Your ability to manipulate the book gets increasingly complex--eventually you can tilt the book to let objects inside it slide around, freeze certain pieces of the environment to keep them from moving, and even close the book to transfer an object from one page to another. The puzzle solutions hit a sweet spot of tickling your brain without venturing too far into the overly taxing or frustrating. If you do get stuck, there's almost always a hint totem nearby that will point you in the right direction without entirely spelling out the solution."
"The hint system is Minibeard, a miniaturized simulacrum of your wizard mentor, Moonbeard. In the real world he manifests as a piece of merch: a My Talkin' Minibeard doll. Your other friends, a young witch in training named Violet and a rock-and-roll mountain troll named Thrash, round out the main cast. The land of Mojo has the surreal, comical stylings of a show like Adventure Time, with fun little touches throughout to give it a sense of personality and place. The city of Artia, the royal center of Mojo, is not only composed of artistic tools like paintbrushes, but also full of characters who visually reference famous works of art like Edvard Munch's The Scream or The Son of Man by Magritte. The mountain trolls are old-school metal-heads, and so many of the trees in their environment take the shape of throwing horns. Every time I thought I had seen everything the world of Mojo had to offer, it threw a new surprise that made me smile."
"That's true for the gameplay as well. The Plucky Squire takes full advantage of its meta-breaking premise to introduce loads of variety that break up the pacing. In one early example, you need to venture outside the book to find a bow from a nearby elven huntress, only to discover that the one you're searching for resides in a Magic The Gathering-like CCG card. So you leap into the card and engage in a simple turn-based RPG battle to earn her bow. This only happens once in the game, and then it's off to the next activity. At another point, you jump into a spaceship mug and the game briefly turns into a side-scrolling shoot-em-up. Jot and his friends take part in boss battles that resemble Punch-Out, a color-matching puzzle game, and a rhythm game. It's genre tourism, but each of them is so well-crafted that they're more than welcome as breathers for the main adventure."
"The result is a game that feels anchored safely in classic Zelda-like mechanics, while also allowing itself to be bursting with new ideas and creative touches that make the world lively and distinct. Those ideas continue right up until the final boss encounter, which introduces yet another new gameplay type that feels wholly different from everything that came before. This can be a risky proposition, as often games that venture too far outside their core mechanics at the very end can feel tacked on or lacking confidence in a finale. Thankfully, The Plucky Squire put just as much care and craftsmanship into this as it did its other genre experiments, helping it to feel like the culmination of a grand storybook adventure."
"The Plucky Squire is a joyful story about creativity and inspiration that is itself both creative and frequently inspired. In the world of the game, The Plucky Squire is a beloved franchise and popular character with multiple entries in his long-running series. Here in the real world, he deserves to be a star too, and I can only hope this is the start of his success story."
"Anecdotally, I've heard from a lot of people who say they're tired of roguelites. There's been a years-long run on this genre, especially in the indie space where drilling down on systems, rather than expensive environments and setpieces, can be cost-effective while still producing something exciting and worthwhile. Because a roguelite game can take so many different shapes, I've not yet had my fill of them. Maybe fatigue will set in one day, though if games in the genre continue to be as great as Wild Bastards, I don't think I'll ever grow weary of them."
"Wild Bastards comes from Blue Manchu, the same studio that released Void Bastards in 2019. Like that prior project, Wild Bastards is a strategy-shooter hybrid wrapped in a roguelite framework. But where Void Bastards drew clear inspiration from games like BioShock and System Shock 2, comparisons for Wild Bastards are harder to draw. It's a fascinating blend of arena shooter, turn-based strategy, and even something like a single-player hero shooter all in one."
"Wild Bastards is a sci-fi western mash-up with the same subtle sense of humor as the team's last game. In it, you'll explore procedurally generated clusters of planets in the hopes of reassembling your posse against all odds. Thirteen outlaws were killed by the game's main antagonist, and it's up to you to resurrect them and reassemble the titular Wild Bastards crew."
"This is done in several intricate steps. First, you'll arrive on an overworld map and choose which planets you'll travel to as you make your way toward your crony at the end of the chain. This immediately demands thoughtfulness, as you can sometimes take a shorter and/or easier route to your goal, depending on which path you decide to go down. Some planets may be loaded with loot, like weapon mods, fast-travel beacons, and beans, which squash grudges or form friendships among your crew, but these same planets may also house tougher or more numerous enemies, as well as fierce conditions such as superstorms or obstructive snow."
"From the space-travel map view, you can get a sense--but not a clear picture--of what each planet has to offer. This is the first in a multi-step process in which Void Bastards routinely challenges you to think ahead and stay alert of what you need to continue through a run, which ends if all of your recruited characters are dead at the same time."
"You must land on every planet you pass, which initiates the game's turn-based gameplay mechanics. Here, you travel an allotted number of moves per turn around a board-game-like map crowded with villains, dangerous wildlife, and the precious loot you've arrived for. Any map is liable to have one to upwards of about 10 high-value items, such as abilities for your crew, mods for their loadouts, and most importantly, new crew members themselves. The bulk of the game is spent reforming the complete 13-member posse, so a successful run ends with you adding a new character to your lineup. It would be unlikely to gather them all without dying--though there is an ironman mode that challenges you to do this if you're up for it."
"You can see all of a planet's pathways once you land, unlike the hazier space-travel map that contains secrets, but even without anything hidden from view at this point, it only gets more complicated. Each planet allows for one to four outlaws to be brought planetside for your mission, almost like they are living, breathing weapon loadouts chosen before you head into battle. During the turn-based map sections, you can't get hurt, though you can still ultimately inflict a lot more pain on your crew and make a successful run damn near impossible by making poor choices."
"This is because every movement, from one tile to the next, has so much weight behind it. If you arrive with six moves to spare per turn, and a boss teased to be arriving on the map to hunt you down in five turns, and you'd need perhaps 40 steps to collect every high-value item on the map, when do you call it quits? Do you plot out the most time-saving path through the terrain, even if it means encountering more enemies along the way? Do you try to skillfully use the planet's helpful features, like teleporters that can get you the hell out of dodge quickly once you've grabbed your fallen friend or a stash of cash? Do you leave it all untouched and just beeline it for the exit tile because ultimately this planet is only a pit stop on the way to the loot you need on a later planet?"
"These are a few of what must be a dozen or more considerations each planet had me asking myself through the game's 20-hour campaign. The beauty of it all is that there's really no wrong answer, just easier and harder solutions. It was always up to me to decide when to say enough is enough, and once I said it, I'd then find out if I was right or wrong based on how I fared with my exit strategy. As my posse, featuring a robot sheriff, a spider-like alien, an anthropomorphized fireball, and more, I could quite literally buck around and find out."
"Each time you land on a space enemies occupy (or they land on your space), you enter the game's final stage of its three-part gameplay loop; there, a ""showdown"" where rootin' tootin' first-person shootin' kicks off. This moves the game from a turn-based board game to traditional FPS gameplay unfolding on procedurally generated levels with touches of Quake and Overwatch simultaneously. Each map has an arena-like quality to it, with high and low vantage points, environmental hazards, some destructible elements--though which parts would or would not break remained a bit unclear for me for much of the game--and a host of villains to eliminate before you can escape and return to the turn-based planet map."
"The gunplay is pixel-perfectly reliable no matter which of the 13 diverse characters you've brought with you onto the planet. Just like Void Bastards before it, I find there's something about the game's 2D objects in a 3D world that makes aiming incredibly satisfying and trustworthy. Maybe it's because its distinct solid lines and breaks in colors help me intuitively track my target better than, say, a moving target in a Call of Duty where everything tends to be a vaguer mist of military garb, natural flora colors, and probably some explosions. Here, the game's artwork not only looks gorgeous and stylized, but it aids an already excellent-feeling experience on the controller or mouse and keyboard alike."
"I'm thankful those mechanics are so reliable, because it makes each of the 13 playable characters, effectively hero-shooter characters built for solo play, so much fun to use. No two characters are anything alike. They each have their own weapon, voice, backstory, and can form relationships with other outlaws that help or hinder the group, like becoming friends with a member so that they will buff one another in showdowns, or causing a ruckus to the point that you can't even pair them on missions together until their conflict is resolved. You'll no doubt lean on your favorites--mine included an alien with a high jump and a ray gun, a militarized horse with an augmented targeting system, and a card dealer equipped with a punishing double-barrel shotgun--but there's not a bad outlaw in the wild bunch."
"The individual gang members account for a wide variety of ranged attacks and play styles. Hopalong, for example, is a python who can slither very fast around the map, flanking enemies to lasso them and choke them out from close range. The Judge is a tank with a slow-loading rifle that specializes in critical hits. Kaboom is a ball of talking pinkish mist who can throw dynamite up and over enemy barricades or into open windows where they're hunkering down."
"Because of each character's use cases, you'll find groups you like to bring on missions together, like using Fletch's bow and arrow that can turn enemies into friendlies, allowing you to amass an army of good guys to take on an incoming boss with Sarge, a horse who can locate enemies from great distances, preventing them from flanking you. When you've turned a half-dozen villains into allies and you can no longer lose sight of the boss, it feels like the climax of a Marvel movie when all the heroes storm the enemy with dramatic flair."
"The game's social system can be a little unclear, however. It allows you to form friendships between pairings of different outlaws or sometimes even creates grudges. In the latter's case, these tended to occur as preordained story beats meant to cause friction in your squad and give you a new challenge to overcome. Feuding allies can't beam down to a planet together, so you'd need to separate them like argumentative siblings until they hashed it out over a shared can of beans."
"When friendships form, allies will provide extra support to their buddies, like one hero sending a pack of four-legged robot ""koyotes"" with you to start a mission. I liked the effects of this system in either direction, but it was usually unclear to me how I was affecting it beyond cooking up beans to immediately form bonds or rebuild bridges. Whenever these outcomes would occur following a mission, I wasn't sure why, and it almost seemed random outside of the scripted story beats."
"Each character can be further tuned for specific builds, like turning the gatling gun-equipped Preach into a health-siphoning vampire, or piling on The Judge's tank-like qualities with layers of additional armor that protect his HP across many showdowns if you're careful. Leveling them up via cards found on planets, managing their stamina, and keeping them above 0 HP (or at least healing them if they dip that low) adds layers to systems already well-layered, and each one is a welcome new twist to your preparation and routine."
"The nature of each showdown tends to involve several enemies from the game's expansive lineup of baddies flanking you from different directions, forcing you to control a crowd of enemies that may likely vary more than your small handful of characters brought into the showdown. You can switch between any characters you brought with you on a whim, and they'll immediately replace the previous one--again, think of it like switching weapons, except in this case, you're trading one whole being for another instantaneously. This usually makes a showdown fast-paced, though depending on which enemies you're pitted against, it may be more of a knock-down, drag-out fight with perhaps just one single ultra-sturdy foe. At other points, you may be aimlessly tossing dynamite in the direction of enemy voice lines, hoping you'll land a stick close enough to their boots to clear a small group. I enjoyed each showdown no matter its composition."
"Knowing when to grab a level's pick-ups--should it have any--is yet another consideration. One of my favorite details is how Casino's ability will randomly kill only but always exactly one enemy in the showdown. If you pick up that item in a boss battle and save it for when only the boss remains, you can kill them with the simple press of a button. Where other games may restrict you from trying such a smart maneuver and force you to take on the boss with other means, Wild Bastards rewards you for being so savvy."
"To understand the game's many layers is to be excitedly challenged by them at all times. Seeking the optimal path through a complex web of interlocking systems makes finding it immensely gratifying. I knew I could make it through any scenario if I only played each one the right way, and that always felt within my grasp. Only my execution might fail me."
"After a few failures, I felt like I could see through the matrix and knew where I'd gone wrong--maybe I waited to leave a planet for too long and the boss buried me, or I got cocky and bum-rushed the last enemy in a showdown who proceeded to one-shot me, when a more patient version of events likely would've meant victory. I never felt like anything that went wrong was the game putting its thumb on the scale. Each time I'd master a new system or think I'd found my groove, more layers would be there to force me to adapt, but never in a way that felt like it was piling on just so I'd have to play more than a few runs to beat the game. A few scripted narrative moments demanded that I grew more acquainted with some of my least used anti-heroes, and when I ultimately emerged from that challenge victorious, I felt like I'd come out the other side scathed, but breathing, and better for it."
"This three-tiered gameplay loop of seeking specific loot merely hinted at, then navigating a crowded hostile planet in search of that loot and life-saving materials, before ultimately squaring off with a lengthy list of enemy classes in stylish first-person gunfights makes every few minutes of gameplay feel like a chess match and an action movie at the same time."
"Going hand-in-hand with its striking aesthetic is the game's subtle sense of humor. There's a lot more dialogue here than you might expect given the game can't reasonably be called story-driven. But the members of your posse have a long history, and you'll come to learn of it in playing a full successful run. Their personalities are surprisingly vibrant, though best of all are the enemies, who yell out some hilarious things. My favorite of them, the Hunters, speak with British accents and distort typical video-game callouts with needlessly complicated versions of the same sentiment. For example, rather than ask their cronies about my location, they'd cry out ""Who perceives the hideous foe?"" and instead of a standard, ""I'm flanking!"" they'd yell, ""Perhaps a change of scenery!"" It's very odd, and I found myself cracking up at these villains many times, sometimes even keeping them alive longer so I could hear more of their voice lines."
"If there's any notable letdown for the game, it's the final few moments. Though the last of the procedurally generated maps certainly ramp up the difficulty to a noticeable but still fair degree, I actually hoped for some kind of final showdown that felt grander than all those before it, perhaps even letting me use a greater number of my outlaws or spread them across multiple major skirmishes to decide the fate of my run. I suppose this betrays some of the game's systems, and so it's sensible for it not to do this. But then, in lieu of that, the final act has a way of feeling no different than the several that led up to it. That still makes it a supremely satisfying strategy-shooter hybrid, but narratively, it unfolds anticlimactically."
"But even as the last hour doesn't push the envelope one last time, I lost count of how many times Wild Bastards had already done so. Plus, for the most dedicated players, other game modes await after you beat the game, including one that throws many more variables into a run, which blends well with the game's expansive difficulty options that can make all of these aforementioned systems much easier or harder."
"Wild Bastards is the second instance in as many games where Blue Manchu has left me mesmerized with its knack for creating intricate, interwoven gameplay systems and arranging them in such a way that rewards careful planning and skilled improvisation at different times. With a fantastic cast of 13 unique characters, tight gunplay, a striking sense of style and humor, and a deep array of possibilities in every part of its three-phase loop, Wild Bastards is unholstered brilliance."
"In terms of story, there isn't really one to speak of. The game opens with our titular Sciuridae dropping into a secret government bunker to procure a golden acorn. Once the tasty treat is in your possession, you then obtain a pistol from a clumsy Agent Smith-looking spook before being unleashed on a suburban neighborhood to cause mischief and blast away dozens of government agents in search of more acorns. Gathering a specific number of nuts grants you access to new areas, leading to two eventual boss battles against a pair of agents known as Father and Mother (for reasons that aren't clear). Defeating both wraps up the game, covering the entire extent of Squirrel With a Gun's paper-thin narrative."
"Lacking any semblance of a story is fine in a game like this, but you would naturally expect some kind of irreverent humor to compensate for the scarcity of character elsewhere. Squirrel With a Gun doesn't attempt to be funny with any sort of regularity; instead, it mainly relies on the image of a squirrel holding a comparatively large shotgun or rocket launcher to provide comedic relief. Maybe you'll get a kick out of a section where you waterski down a river or chuckle when the ragdoll physics break entirely, but humor is not this game's forte."
"Combat is neither fun nor satisfying either. The only enemies you encounter are government agents who mostly just stand around waiting to die. They all ragdoll to death in a few bullets--whether you hit them in the shin or chest--but nailing a headshot does at least put the hapless spooks into a downed state that leaves them susceptible to a special takedown. These elaborate animations see our furry protagonist spin a six-shooter around like Revolver Ocelot and use the butt of a sniper as a blunt object. They're fun the first time, but there's only one of these animations for each weapon, so the novelty wears off quickly."
"The only time the game's gunplay differs from other shooters in any meaningful way relates to your size. Whether it's a pistol or a shotgun, the force of each shot propels your tiny frame backward as you hold on for dear life. Due to the game's lackluster sound design and enemies' muted reactions, this still doesn't make your small arsenal of weapons feel particularly impactful. Having to realign your aim after every shot is simply a nuisance that further compounds the game's shallow gunplay as it struggles to justify its premise."
"Fortunately, Squirrel With a Gun's puzzle-platforming fares slightly better. Its sandbox is fairly small, and aside from one house that's filled with lava, the rest of the properties in its bizarre suburban neighborhood are almost entirely empty. Nonetheless, each one essentially functions as a miniature level containing a number of golden acorns for you to collect. You can acquire some of these nuts via short platforming challenges, while others take an ounce of ""logical"" thinking to overcome. This might mean blowing up a barbeque and then gathering the smoking hot patties for those waiting with empty buns, or using kettlebells to weigh yourself down so you can sink to the bottom of a pool. Some of these conundrums require a moment of consideration, although the presence of a single solution ensures that there's no room for creativity."
"On the platforming side, firing your gun into the ground as a means of double jumping is a far more interesting use of the game's firearms than any part of its combat. There's also some enjoyment to be had in figuring out how to traverse certain sections, but imprecise and floaty controls--not to mention an erratic camera that often obscures your view--are detrimental to any kind of precision platforming. Even simple leaps are often frustrating as you actively fight against the game's unpleasant movement."
"On top of all this, Squirrel With a Gun is also plagued by a plethora of dire technical issues. Falling through the floor is a semi-regular occurrence, especially during the first boss fight. At one point, I ran into a glitch where the squirrel failed to materialize during a cutscene, which broke the whole game and forced me to restart. I encountered a few crashes and optimization issues on PC, too. It's not a particularly good-looking game, yet I still had to lower several settings to prevent the frame rate from tanking. While this isn't a technical shortcoming per se, the amount of music is also limited and quickly becomes grating as you're forced to suffer the same song over and over again."
"Squirrel With a Gun isn't aggressively bad, and I didn't hate my time with it. It was basically just a thing that I did for four hours. Nothing about the experience really stands out; the whole game is entirely unremarkable and won't live long in the memory. It's kind of like seeing a squirrel in real life. You go, ""Oh look, a squirrel,"" watch the furry critter scurry up a tree, and then get on with your day. That's Squirrel With a Gun in a nutshell."
"Marvel Vs. Capcom Fighting Collection, however, brings together all six of those era-defining fighting games--along with the historic brawler that started the core partnership between Marvel and Capcom--in a new era. Thankfully, this package presents each game in a way that celebrates that storied past while also injecting new life into them with modern features, creating a collection that's up to the task of reintroducing these classics to a new age of players."
"The meat of the collection is in the fighting games. Each of the six fighting games in this collection are the arcade version--no console ports to be found. This is of course the right call, as each title represents the purest form, running mostly as it was intended back in the 1990s--save for a few frame-rate issues that pop up from time to time. However, it also exposes which of these games are showing their age, and which can still stand with the modern fighters of today."
"Marvel Vs. Capcom 2--the marquee title of the collection--is just as good now as it was when it first launched 24 years ago thanks to its fast and frenetic three-on-three gameplay and massive 56-character roster. Mixing and matching with teams, trying to find big combos, and watching all three unleash a super move at the same time is still riveting and engaging. X-Men: Children Of The Atom, on the other hand, has a slower pace, only offers 10 characters, and follows a more traditional one-on-one, first-to-two-rounds format. Comparing two games that were released seven years apart could be considered unfair, as COTA is by no means a bad fighting game. However, it is the most “basic” fighter of the bunch, and the disparity between it and other games in the package makes COTA less enticing than the rest."
"The rest of the games included here don't have enough to knock MvC2 off of the marquee, but they offer plenty of fun in their own right. Marvel Super Heroes's Infinity Stone mechanic offers an interesting wrinkle to the one-on-one format by powering up attacks, slowly healing damage, or adding projectiles to every basic punch and kick. X-Men Vs. Street Fighter serves as the foundation for Capcom's approach to tag-based fighters, even if the roster is smaller than the others in the collection."
"Marvel Super Heroes Vs. Street Fighter and the original Marvel Vs. Capcom, meanwhile, each offer something even MvC2 can't deliver on: secret fighters. Both games have extra selections hidden on their character select screens--as does X-Men Vs. Street Fighter, but it's Akuma, who appears in other games--and both offer fighters that don't appear elsewhere."
"MSHvSF adds Shadow, U.S. Agent, and Mephisto--alternate takes on Charlie Nash, Captain America, and Blackheart respectively--among others, while MvC introduces Roll to the series, while also offering superpowered takes on Venom, War Machine, Hulk, and more. These characters are admittedly game-breaking, and they don't supplant the MvC2 experience, but they give both of these games something worthy of booting them up once in a while."
"One noticeable outlier is The Punisher, the aforementioned side-scrolling brawler from 1993. More Final Fight than Street Fighter, this is a fun albeit short beat-'em-up that serves as the first game ever made in the Marvel/Capcom partnership. It's got some weirdly over-the-top violence mixed in--the fate of the first boss is specifically jarring--but the brawling is fun enough, either alone or with a friend via co-op. Other than being a nice piece of history, however, it doesn't add much to the collection."
"The modern perks each of these games receive are mostly blessings, but a few small annoyances have surfaced along the way. The quick-save feature from other Capcom collections returns, allowing you to retain your progress in an instant, but the problem here is huge: There's only one quick-save slot for all seven games in the collection."
"Any deep run in a single game is jeopardized if you decide to play a different game the next time we boot the collection up, instead of each game having its own individual quick-save slot, which makes a helpful modern tool turn into a major annoyance when having to choose between games when quick-saving. A showdown with The Punisher's final boss should not be forced to be erased when a MvC run progresses all the way to Onslaught because of a baffling limitation like this."
"The best modern addition, without question, is rollback netcode in all seven games. The advent of rollback has supercharged the entire fighting-game genre, and this MvC Collection benefits from the improved online capabilities. The majority of matches played online were smooth, with little to no noticeable hiccups. Granted, this was during a review period without a full consumer fanbase trying to log in, so a grain of salt should be taken. Nonetheless, online matches felt as if my opponent were sitting next to me."
"The rest of the collection's extra features are a trip down memory lane via the Museum, which offer both a gallery of concept art and design documents for each game and a jukebox for listening to each game's full soundtrack. There are some interesting nuggets of information in there for diehard MvC fans--like how the Japanese marquee card for X-Men: Children Of The Atom featured Cyclops and other heroes, while the US version has them all turned into silhouettes. Nothing is added to the core gameplay with these features, obviously, but the history lesson is appreciated all the same."
"Before this collection, it had been nearly 12 years to the day since any of these games had seen an official release: the Marvel Vs. Capcom Origins bundle on September 25, 2012. Days, months, and years passed--along with a new release in the franchise that drew an infinite amount of ire, pardon the pun--with fans not knowing when these games would be freed from their seemingly endless stasis. Now, Marvel Vs. Capcom Fighting Collection has opened the floodgates with aplomb, grouping them all into a package worthy of the modern era. There are some issues, and some of these games don't hold up quite as well as others, but the fact that they're all here is a terrific act of preservation worthy of praise."
"Whether you liked these games originally or are just playing them now, Marvel Vs. Capcom Fighting Collection is a great place to experience them. Put another way, it's going to take you for a ride."
"Like its past several installments, NBA 2K25 is the best sports game I've played this year, but it still comes with a bolded, can't-miss asterisk. This year's basketball sim from Visual Concepts represents the latest in a series that has been lapping the competition in the sports genre--a group of games each seeking to be your live-service obsession. None justify their time commitment as well as NBA 2K25, which is in a league of its own--for presentation, gameplay, and overall immersion first and foremost--but the whole is actually less than the sum of its parts due to long-embedded pay-to-win tactics I fear will never be undone."
"This year's biggest changes involve a new dribbling physics system that gives ball-control a more realistic feel. The impact of this is hard to explain but easy to recognize when you're playing it, aided by enhancements to the game's ProPlay animation system that converts real-life game footage to in-game mechanics. Virtually everyone has, at one point in their lives, played basketball, even if it's just shooting baskets at the park or a friend's house. You know what it feels like to maintain ball control and dribble, keeping it away from other players and feeling the weight of the ball as you learn to control it without needing to observe yourself doing so. NBA 2K25 captures that authentically, adding additional support to an already-excellent gameplay foundation that goes back years."
"Unlike some other series that dispose of ideas if they don't work after a few years, NBA 2K has always seemed more committed to iteration, tweaking unwelcome features until they become enjoyable ones, and turning good aspects into great ones. Year two of the ProPlay system expresses this attribute. 2K24's foundational overhaul is made more nuanced with numerous new animations, many of them built to mimic a player's real-life play style. Basketball is a sport composed of many individuals who approach the sport in different ways, such that no two hoopers play exactly alike. NBA 2K25 better replicates that player specificity with more unique jumpshots, signature moves, and even post-score celebrations that are pulled from real life."
"Last year, the community was up in arms about the game's ""green-or-miss"" shooting mechanics. This meant players would need to time their shots perfectly (landing in the green zone in their shot meter) or else they'd miss the attempt. This year, the Visual Concepts team has addressed that feedback by offering two divergent shooting options. One of them uses the same green-or-miss mechanics of last year, which has a high-risk, high-reward outcome and relies on your own controller skills to overcome a strongly contested or off-balance shot. The latter is more forgiving of a less-than-perfect attempt, but is more beholden to things like positioning and defense. To borrow from Madden's terms, this is the ""sim"" option to the former's ""competitive"" option."
"Effectively, this gives all players their choice of a retuned version of last year's system or what was in the game before 2K24. In either case, it's all made more manageable thanks to the game's incredible UI customization options and create-a-jumpshot suite. Combined, these features allow you to not only alter the look of your on-screen shot meter, tweaking its size, shape, colors, and placement, but also build your own jumper so you can find something with a timing pattern that works best for you."
"On-court play runs very deep, and for new players it can be daunting. NBA 2K finally offers something it's lacked: a deep skills trainer that tutorializes the whole game. Learn 2K mode is designed for basketball novices, intermediate players, and even pro-level competitors needing a practice facility between games. It teaches basic fundamentals of the sport to more complex features with a wildly high skill ceiling, such as ball skills and fakeout moves--ankle breakers, essentially."
"This new suite is only a good thing, as sports games tend to become impenetrable over time because they can assume most players are returning from past years, but each game is some number of players' first foray, so it's great to have this robust new game mode onboarding players who need it."
"For many years now, no other sports game has captured the atmosphere of an authentic TV broadcast of its real-life sport quite like 2K. That continues in 2K25, and though there are perhaps no major bells and whistles debuting in the presentation side of things this year, it's also hard to fathom how it could improve much. It feels like the series has hit its ceiling in this respect, but it's a ceiling to be proud of, and no other sports game is nearly reaching its own."
"Commentary is once again lifelike to a degree that keeps it at the very best in video games. It uses multiple commentary teams featuring loveable personalities like Kevin Harlan and also keeps all of its talent sounding realistic, delivering depth and a cadence that would fool you into thinking it's a real NBA game if you were only listening to it. Commentators recall past matchups accurately and discuss NBA history and rival showdowns yet to come, before inviting players to interact in post-game press conferences and answer questions from the media."
"Timeouts oscillate from sideline playcalling huddles between coaches and players to the wide-ranging on-court entertainment, like mascots performing tricks or dance crews putting on stylish shows during would-be lulls. The atmosphere, score bug, crowd and commentator reactions--it's all incredible. It's been this impressive for a while now, but it never gets old."
"Halftime shows remain hilarious and actually worth watching, and the hosts jump around the league to discuss other scores and highlights with a welcome blend of mirth and analysis. In between games in the career mode, an in-universe TV show--the likes of which is reliably cringeworthy in games like MLB The Show and Madden--is instead entertaining in NBA 2K25. I don't skip them. They're fully animated, voiced, and actually compelling, like one episode in which the hosts debate how to rank the league's dynasties throughout its history."
"No other sports game is going to these lengths, and though other series' try to do some of these things, they are often not compelling enough to experience more than once or twice. In NBA 2K25, I don't touch the skip button. When I started a new season as the Celtics, I watched their championship-ring ceremony on opening night and marveled at how great the cutscene came together. NBA 2K25 looks, sounds, and feels like real life, and it makes me a bigger basketball fan because of these features."
"Another now-annual expression of how this series laps the competition is its franchise-style mode, MyNBA. Two years ago, Visual Concepts introduced Eras, a trailblazing feature that lets you start a league in one of several different decades dating back 40+ years. Each era includes attire, rulebooks, playstyles, presentation, and rosters that authentically capture those various points in time. This was impressive out of the gate, and like last year, a new Era has been added in 2K25: the Steph Curry Era."
"Like the Kobe Era did when it debuted last year, this adds a new gamified starting point in NBA history and seeks to tell the story of the period with things like more complicated player contracts and the new in-season tournament for the NBA Cup. While the bulk of this mode's exciting feature set was introduced two years ago, a new Era is a fine way to build it out further, though this particular Era has the least appeal of any so far as it's effectively present-day and less of an intriguing time capsule like the others."
"NBA 2K has been expanding on its WNBA modes in recent years, and this year's suite is yet again its most robust yet--though it's still catching up to offering feature parity with the men's league. The WNBA is more popular than ever right now, owed partly to high-profile rookies like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese, and the game mode reflects that with the same excellent presentation elements that sell the appropriate gravity of this new era of women's basketball. In The W, akin to the men's MyCareer mode, you can now participate in press conferences as your created athlete for the first time in the series, and you'll focus largely on chasing historical greatness with in-game elements that challenge you to outperform the aforementioned star rookies before eventually reaching the WNBA's GOAT status."
"I enjoy this aspect for different reasons than the MyCareer version. In that case, it's more of an exploration of basketball history I largely already know. With the WNBA, it's a lot newer to me, so it's been fun to play the mode more like a history lesson. Commentators recall legends of decades past or more recent runs like Becky Hammon's back-to-back titles with Las Vegas. In press conferences, the media's questions help me infer additional context for a league that was in the background for so long, but as it's now coming into a brighter spotlight, 2K's offerings feel like they're built to match that next level of interest."
"You sadly can't take your WNBA player into the game's social space, which I detail below, but it feels like the 2K team is making a genuine effort to expand on this suite of modes, and it amounts to about as much content as some other major sports games on the market. As it does in many other ways, the game's WNBA suite suggests many more resources or much greater use of its resources to create a game with this much cool stuff to play."
"The game's main attraction comes in two different but closely linked features: MyPlayer and The City. MyPlayer is the avatar players create, choosing from one of several RPG-like builds or customizing their stats pip by pip across many categories like dunking, three-point shooting, vertical jumping, and lots more. You can put your own face on the character by using a mobile companion app, and that technology has become better over time to where I now use it every year and like how it turns out--this wasn't always the case."
"With your MyPlayer, you can play their backstory, which takes you through high school, a FIBA World Cup game, and more before joining an NBA team in MyCareer, which is the single-player mode that focuses on your avatar's achievements. 2K25 builds on last year's GOAT list, in which players tried to pass Jordan and others to be recognized as the NBA's best player ever, to now build a dynasty that can surpass the likes of the Showtime Lakers, LeBron's Heat, and Curry's Warriors."
"In other sports games, this solo story mode often feels like a barebones preamble to some other longer-term mode you're meant to move onto swiftly. But in 2K25, this isn't the case. Though there is a separate element the game wants to funnel you into, it's also built out a lot to make playing multiple seasons in the NBA very enjoyable in its own right. Chasing NBA history is tough, and the game makes your championships and accolades feel well-recognized, with a social feed, media reactions, and live-action messages from other athletes sliding into your DMs to congratulate you. The mode successfully captures the magnitude of moments, owing to the aforementioned best-in-class presentation."
"Before, during, or after your NBA career, you can also take your player into The City, a sports-MMO social space with live-service elements like daily and weekly challenges, a huge variety of game modes, and plenty of shopping opportunities. The City is where I'll spend most of my time post-review sessions every September, because it's the central hub of the game's massive community and the activities in it are usually enjoyable. However, its daily and weekly challenge system asks too much of my time and prevents me from ever considering buying the battle pass since I know I'd have to give up some other games in my free time to hit all of NBA's live-service goals. In other live-service games in which I've invested my time, completing my dailies tends to take 15-45 minutes by design. NBA 2K25's orders are more time-consuming, to an extent that I sooner write off trying to keep up at all."
"Games of different sizes and with varying, sometimes arcade-y rules, can be found all over in different parts of the city. You can take on challenging CPU boss battles against NBA legends, jump into 3v3 pick-up games with random players, train at the gym to improve your player's stats and gameplay-altering badges, or enter into ultra-sweaty Pro-Am games with a dedicated squad of teammates seeking to be recognized at the game's best players."
"As a play space, The City rules. Every other sports game looks worse in comparison each subsequent year they fail to offer something similar. A vibrant social scene is the lifeblood of a live-service game, and NBA 2K remains the only annual sports game offering such an awesome virtual hangout space to its players."
"In years past, I've enjoyed The City but lamented its pop-up ad aesthetic; it looked like a shopping mall from hell, with billboards and branded content in every direction you could look. This year's game cleverly fixes this problem, if only incidentally, by reimagining The City as a beach boardwalk setting. I find malls fundamentally unappealing, but a beach boardwalk is much more palatable as a place where I'd expect to find several stores, so I no longer mind a few ever-present blocks of shoe, clothing, tattoo, and backpack stores. Simply by the game presenting it differently, I don't feel bombarded with ads to spend my virtual currency, even though just as many options remain there."
"Having said all that praise, The City being the game's prime attraction also reveals its one major flaw: a pay-to-win economy. Because the same currency used to buy cosmetics for your custom player can also be used to make that custom athlete much better on the court--from a player rated 60 overall all the way up to 99 for those willing to buy that much virtual currency--the game's coolest unique feature is also hamstrung for reasons that aren't mysterious and yet remain mystifying in their brazenness. Over many years, NBA 2K has nurtured a community that eagerly opts into spending a lot of extra money on day one so they can stay afloat in the social scene, and each year this approach returns, it harms the otherwise fantastic game's overall appeal."
"Because I've been writing about the way NBA 2K wages war against itself for a few years now in my reviews, I've actually stepped out of the review to write a companion piece this year, in which I go to greater lengths to discuss the game's microtransaction--more accurately a macrotransaction--problem. This is an issue that's been seen in this game's annual installments for many years now, and in NBA 2K25, things have not noticeably improved--though you can now more easily matchmake with more casual players and build squads of others with in-game avatars similar to yours in rating."
"These address some symptoms of the game's economic woes, but they don't fix enough despite an obvious cure being available: prevent players from buying stat upgrades. That route surely loses the publisher an unfathomable amount of money, so I worry we'll never see it come to fruition. You can read my extensive thoughts on that at the link above, but it's safe to say that this serves as a blemish on NBA 2K25's otherwise excellent gameplay experience."
"NBA 2K is a peculiar game to critique for this perennial reason; like a social media label for a messy relationship, it's complicated. Suffice it to say the thoughts I've expressed in that companion piece weigh on my conclusion here, and you should consider this a two-part review, in a sense. 2K25's greatest flaw is obvious: Its economic designs make the game worse, and it's impossible for anyone without a Randian ""greed is good"" worldview to justify it."
"At the same time, everything else it does is so impressive, both as a basketball sim and when stacked next to any other sports game, that it's a delicate balance to find with words. It does so much so well, and much of it is done uniquely. But its refusal to decouple its marquee features from its virtual currency keeps this championship contender from reaching its full potential."
"Supermassive and Behaviour have each been instrumental in defining the genre over the past decade. The former's horror games have come as cinematic choose-your-own-adventure stories where the fates of multiple playable characters come down to your choices, often made in high-stress situations. Meanwhile, the latter blazed a trail now well-trodden: asymmetric multiplayer horror. Dead By Daylight's (DBD) Fortnite-like approach of swallowing up many major horror icons into one space has given it not just staying power, but a twisted Disneyland vibe. Now, with The Casting of Frank Stone, the pair combine forces to tell a Dead By Daylight origin story that will appeal most to fans of the PvP game, though I can say, as a casual DBD fan, I found it enjoyable on its own merits too, despite its issues."
"Frank Stone plays much like Supermassive's run of games that began with 2015's Until Dawn. It is a gameplay-light, movie-like experience that you get to direct, in a sense. You'll control several characters, form their relationships with others in the story, and, most excitingly, try to keep them alive through a story full of quick-time events (QTEs) and doomed choices that can get them killed off permanently."
"For me, this formula hasn't outstayed its welcome yet, and I'm not sure it ever will. It feels like the kind of game I would happily play each autumn for the rest of my life, even as the narrative merits vary by game. Historically, I've found that no Supermassive script truly stands up to scrutiny, and Frank Stone is no different in that regard. Because of the branching paths, sometimes you may see a scene that feels a bit off, like it better suits a choice I didn't make and never saw."
"That's a jarring and commonplace flaw of horror games like Frank Stone, The Quarry, and The Dark Pictures Anthology. If they were strictly movies, I'd certainly be harsher on them. However, the interactive elements that make Frank Stone a cinematic game rather than a traditional movie help overshadow some of its flaws. Living in these scary stories is fun. Knowing I can and will drastically affect the outcome at numerous points throughout the game kept me glued to this game like its predecessors. Frank Stone isn't my favorite of them, but as Supermassive continues to chase the high of Until Dawn, I welcome the team's annual attempts to rebottle that magic with projects like this one."
"When I got one of my main characters killed early on in Frank Stone, it was shocking, but in a good way. I want there to be stakes, and even when Frank Stone didn't always mesh its story beats together as cohesively as I wish it would've, I remained invested because my fingerprints still seemed to be all over the plot. Characters' relationships were altered on my watch, and I even pulled a couple back from breaking up (only to swiftly get one of them cut in half--oops)."
"Outside of QTEs that abide by your difficulty settings--pro tip: play on Hard for the most chaotic outcomes--gameplay consists of many dialogue options, almost always binary unless you unlock additional things to say by exploring the world and gathering collectibles with lots of backstories tied to them. This makes scanning nearby tables and corners for book covers, documents, and other hidden items a valuable use of your time, though it does once again reveal a very video-gamey problem for these projects chasing Hollywood pacing; in movies, the protagonist doesn't run along the walls seeking out Easter eggs before they get on with their mission. But like some narrative disconnects, I find these concessions acceptable enough when the enjoyment of living out these dark tales is doing most of the heavy lifting anyway."
"Supermassive also built a new combat-light mechanic into Frank Stone. Combat is uncommon in its library of titles and it should perhaps stay that way, as the shallow feature ends up not being compelling. Players are meant to point an object at the titular monster to keep him at bay throughout the story, but it's always so easy that it becomes boring almost immediately."
"What's worse in Frank Stone, and it's something of a legacy issue itself, is the frequent technical issues . It's a good-looking game but it stutters a lot when transitioning between scenes. Not all of them, but too many. This pulls me out of the experience more than some loose narrative threads do. I'm not sure what can be done to fix this, but it's a problem that's been in other Supermassive games like this, even though this is build on a newer version of Unreal Engine."
"The problem is too apparent to have gone unseen, which suggests the team saw it and sent it out anyway. I've found I care about occasional bugs less than most, but when a game's primary appeal is its cinematic quality, these kinds of visual flaws weigh more heavily."
"In story terms, Frank Stone is, like its source material, a mash-up of different genres. It opens like a slasher, quickly descends into supernatural territory, and even throws in some body horror before the end credits. I loved the design of Frank Stone himself, and if you think his first appearance is aesthetically underwhelming, just wait, he has more to unveil in time. Both he and the game's playable characters look like they belong in the DBD world, and I found that indicative of how the two teams closely collaborated to stay true to the source."
"Being set in Behaviour's horror universe affords the game all of the narrative leeway that comes with that setting. For those well-versed with that lore, what this means may already be known to you. For the uninitiated, learning about some of the game's reveals in the second half of its six- to eight-hour story is best left for you to discover on your own. In either case, Frank Stone's story is enjoyable."
"It helps to know the DBD universe, and the more intimately you know it, the more you'll get out of its countless secrets and nods to the multiplayer game. This game's main purpose is to reveal the story behind DBD's Big Bad, The Entity, and the game's climax will be most thrilling for players who care to see the answers to the questions they've had on that subject for years. But even players coming to this as Supermassive devotees or merely horror fans looking for something new can play it as a fun gorefest. Its DBD ties don't lock anyone out of the experience; they only open a few extra windows for players coming over from Behaviour's world. There are several nods that I found clever enough to laugh out loud. These go beyond how the game's QTEs are redressed to look exactly like DBD's skill checks, though I find them to be so cool that I don't want to say any more than that."
"After you beat the game once, you unlock a few welcome features if you're interested in seeing everything the game offers. This includes a collectible-finding mode that basically gives you Batman Arkham-like Detective Vision, as well as an ability to jump into any scene and play out alternate narrative pathways. These features could almost be called quality-of-life fixes given how they erase some of the grinding that would be required without them, and they're not the only new toys I hope become permanent in games like this. Frank Stone also uses a neat on-screen prompt to let you know when advancing past an area will make it inaccessible going forward. This removes any worry about cutting yourself off from an optional item or path prematurely. I hope all the team's future games do this, too."
"By now, those who have played Supermassive's interactive horror ""movies"" since 2015 know what they're getting with The Casting of Frank Stone. If you only want to play the next great version of that formula, this isn't it. But for Dead By Daylight fans looking to fill out their lore bibles, prospective fans looking for an introduction to the multiplayer game, or horror obsessives who are ready to carve pumpkins and dive into a pile of crispy orange leaves, The Casting of Frank Stone is a flawed but fun horror romp just in time for spooky season, the likes of which Supermassive and I may be destined to experience together forever."
"As I thrust my Chainsword into the chest of a Tyranid Warrior and split the vile Xenos in half, I can't help but be reminded of 2016's Doom. From a gameplay perspective, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is nothing like id Software's demon-infested reboot--at best, any similarities between the two are merely superficial. But Space Marine 2 manages to capture a kindred vibe that prodded the part of my brain reserved for all things Doom: one that relishes in gory, balls-to-the-wall action and an unapologetic, almost old-school approach to game design that puts unadulterated fun above all else. It's a game that clearly understands how absurd, horrific, and over-the-top the whole franchise is. There are flaws, but Space Marine 2 improves upon its 13-year-old predecessor in every conceivable way, making you embody an Ultramarine as you stomp your way through a fully realized recreation of Warhammer 40,000's grimdark universe."
"Set roughly 200 years after the events of the first game, Space Marine 2 straps you back into the gaudy power armor of protagonist Demetrian Titus. The erstwhile Captain has spent the past century as a Blackshield in an act of self-imposed penance, fighting among the ranks of the Deathwatch under the belief that he has disgraced his former chapter. When an Archmagos of the Adeptus Mechanicus calls for aid in defending the jungle planet of Kadaku from a Tyranid invasion, Titus is sent to the planet's defense, only to be mortally wounded by a ferocious Carnifex. After being rescued by the Ultramarines, Chapter Master Marneus Calgar has Titus undergo the Rubicon Primaris to save his life, making him faster, stronger, and smarter in the process. Once he emerges from his slumber, Titus intends to return to the Deathwatch but is convinced otherwise; if he truly yearns for redemption, he must rejoin the 2nd Company and help the Avengers of Ultramar repel the assailing Tyranids."
"The setup propels Space Marine 2's action-packed story into motion as you plunge headfirst into the Fourth Tyrannic War. Titus' past immediately adds tension to the proceedings, with his new captain and squadmates wary of his reinstatement due to a checkered service record. This leads to some decent character-building and uneasy infighting, especially with the threat of Chaos lingering in the air. It's not long before the Thousand Sons Chaos Space Marines rear their ugly heads to throw a spanner in the works, but for the most part, Space Marine 2 tells a fairly standard war story amidst the backdrop of Warhammer 40,000's unmistakable world. It's cliched at times but remains engaging throughout. There's rarely a dull moment as you uncover long-dormant secrets and attempt to crush the Imperium's enemies beneath your hefty boots."
"Many of the story beats are also an essential vehicle for getting to the game's brutal action. Much like its predecessor, combat in Space Marine 2 is a fusion of third-person shooting and hack-and-slash skirmishing. Ripping Tyranids and Chaos Space Marines to shreds is incredibly satisfying, and the savage close-quarters melee combat is more nuanced than it was in the first game. Switching between the two gameplay styles is fluid, too, although there is one sticking point: After playing the retro-inspired Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun last year, the Bolter and its variants don't feel quite as special or unique in Titus' hands. Space Marine 2's rendition of the series' iconic weapon is analogous to an assault rifle rather than the rapid-fire rocket launcher it was in Boltgun, so it doesn't quite scratch the same gratifying itch. That doesn't mean it isn't fun to pop skulls from range in Space Marine 2, but the Boltgun isn't as anomalous as it could be. I also wish there were slightly more weapon variety. Firearms like the Melta and Plasma Pistol offer a nice change of pace, but most of your arsenal consists of similar-feeling armaments."
"Despite this, the way enemies explode--projecting crimson fountains of blood into the sky with each hit--still makes for some devilishly fun combat. The Ultramarines' bulky blue armor wasn't built for you to sit back at a distance, so you're constantly in the thick of the action, alternating between Bolt Pistols and the crackling energy of a Power Sword to thin the herd and eviscerate the more fearsome creatures among the Tyranid's ranks. ""Quantity has a quality all its own"" is an apt description of the Tyranid strategy. The smaller Hormagaunts may be weak on their lonesome, but they come in massive, writhing swarms that can quickly overwhelm the Imperium's forces. Developer Saber Interactive built Space Marine 2 on the same proprietary engine it used to create World War Z's zombie hordes, and the result is similarly impressive. It's an awe-inspiring sight to witness a thick throng of the xenos menace barreling toward you, clambering over each other to scale walls and overrun you with their pure strength in numbers."
"A Chainsword can cleave through these compacted swarms, while ranged weapons are useful for depleting the herd's numbers before you're completely suffocated. The Hormagaunts are essentially a frontline nuisance, impeding your path to more dangerous enemies like Tyranid Warriors, Zoanthropes, and Lictors. These threats are best handled mano-e-mano, with parries, dodges, counters, and ""gun strikes"" (cinematic counters that deliver a devastating shot from your equipped firearm) all being crucial to surviving the onslaught. Each of these systems adds complexity and variety to Space Marine 2's melee combat, taking inspiration from modern melee-action games to make these close-range fights more active and engaging than the first game's fisticuffs. Parryable attacks flash with a blue circle, and responding in kind can instantly kill smaller enemies and interrupt bigger foes, leaving them wide open for a counter. Unblockable attacks, on the other hand, are indicated by a red circle, forcing you to either sidestep or roll out of the way of incoming danger. Achieving perfect timing on either a parry or dodge opens your opponent up to a gun strike, unleashing an explosive flourish that's endlessly rewarding."
"Inflicting enough damage on an enemy leaves them vulnerable and exposed to an execution. These visceral killing blows consist of elaborate animations as you tear the limbs from Tyranid Warriors and rip the heads off of Chaos Marines. Aside from providing an audacious punctuation mark at the end of a frenzied skirmish, executions are also vital to the flow of combat due to how each one refills a portion of your armor. You have a few bars of armor which, once depleted, put you in danger of sustaining damage to a health bar that requires consumable stims to replenish--or by doing damage to an enemy immediately after taking damage yourself. The best defense is a good offense, so you're incentivized to target executions and stay in the very thick of the action by skewering Tyranids with their own talons. Running away or finding cover never feels particularly viable, so combat has a hectic intensity that's often thrilling."
"There's also an element of strategy to most encounters, predominantly dictated by the variety of enemy types you'll face. The slippery Ravener can burrow underground and strike from below, forcing you to be ready on the dodge button before attacking quickly so it can't scurry back into the dirt. Meanwhile, the floating, psychic Zoanthropes can buff nearby creatures while peppering you with ranged Psychic attacks, necessitating that you break away from the immediate close-quarters fighting and deal with them from range. This ensures that combat is engaging throughout the roughly eight-hour-long campaign, even when your objectives rarely deviate from moving from point A to B. There are exceptions, like one section that sees you using a Flamer to keep swarms of Rippers at bay, but the emphasis is on all-out combat for the majority of the time."
"Space Marine 2's level design is fairly linear, too. There are occasional moments where you can venture off the beaten path to find audio logs and supplies, but the route through each level is usually pretty straightforward. The thing is, it doesn't always feel like it. The sheer sense of scale and spectacle in each level makes them feel far grander than they actually are. Saber has done a tremendous job of making you feel like a small part of a much bigger war. Whether it's the intense battles raging in the background to the way clusters of Gargoyles blanket the sky, the world constantly feels alive, even as death occurs all around you, and this is further enriched by the game's world-building and environmental design."
"From the planet-spanning metropolis of Avarax, where grandiose spires seem to soar into space, to the gothic interiors of the burial planet Demerium, and Kadaku's dense and oppressive forests, every frame of Space Marine 2 is lathered with attention to the smallest details. Cadians often kneel and talk in hushed whispers as you approach, the retro-futuristic Cogitators whirl to life aboard the Battle Barge, and you'll wander through the remnants of a recent battle as Commissars deliver punishment to soldiers found guilty of cowardice. I don't think I'm going out on a limb when I say Space Marine 2 is the most authentic Warhammer 40,000 game ever. It ran superbly on my PC as well, with nary a frame-rate dip on Ultra settings."
"The feeling of being a single cog in the machine also ties in with Space Marine 2's PvE Operations mode. Throughout the campaign, Titus will issue orders to a secondary squad of Ultramarines, with their missions happening concurrently with Titus'. Operations mode currently consists of six of these missions (with more set to arrive in future updates), and this interconnected setup helps to make each one feel narratively important. The first sortie you embark on, for instance, takes place early in the main campaign, when Titus needs the other squad to block the Tyranid advance long enough for him to complete his own objective. Your customizable Astartes sets down a few miles north with the aim of detonating a promethium refinery and incinerating a massive horde of the Xenos, buying Titus enough time to get in and out before being completely overwhelmed. The objectives in these missions don't change from one replay to the next, but much like World War Z, the AI director will change up the enemies and their numbers in response to your class and playstyle."
"There are six unique classes in total, ranging from a Sniper to the jump-pack-equipped Assault class. Each one has access to a specific assortment of weapons, perks, and abilities. I mostly stuck with the Vanguard, which uses a grapnel launcher to latch on to enemies and propel you toward them. Other classes have abilities that can aid your teammates in battle, such as the sword-and-shield-wielding Bulwark, which can stick a chapter banner in the floor to restore armor to any squad members nearby."
"You can play both the campaign and Operations mode with up to two other players, but the variety of classes ensures that Operations is a much more engaging co-op experience. When either mode is played solo, the bots you're saddled with aren't too shabby. They can hold their own and rack up kills, and they'll deploy their class abilities when they can. Space Marine 2 is obviously a better game with friends, but it's not a steadfast requirement."
"One of the other benefits of playing with friends is the unique fashion on display. Each class is cosmetically customizable, with myriad armor pieces and paint jobs to unlock and equip. Some of these are unlocked by achieving a new rank, while others can be purchased with the coins you earn from completing missions. It's cool that you can turn your Space Marine into an Omega Marine, Black Templar, or your own colorful abomination, but the rate at which you earn some of the customization options is painfully slow. The main issue is that the coins you use to purchase emblems and paint jobs are also required to unlock class and weapon perks, forcing you to weigh up whether you want that Imperial Fist emblem more than a firepower and accuracy upgrade for your Bolt Carbine. It feels like the method for unlocking both should be separate."
"Fortunately, these cosmetics do at least carry over to Space Marine 2's third and final mode, Eternal War. This competitive PvP mode is refreshing in its simplicity, pitting six Space Marines against six Chaos Marines across three game modes and a handful of maps. Annihilation is your typical team deathmatch, Seize Ground is King of the Hill in all but name, and Capture and Control is your standard zone control mode. What it lacks in new ideas, Eternal War makes up for with the way its classes synergize and clash against one another. This begins with how classes are restricted, limiting you to two of each class per team. This might sound negatively prohibitive, but it provides balance and prevents six Heavies from going up against six Heavies."
"With a Heavy Bolter, three bars of armor, and a class perk that gives them a temporary shield, the Heavy class initially appears to be the top dog. That is until you start experimenting with the other five classes. The Bulwark can use its shield to charge at a Heavy and close the distance to where the Heavy's lack of melee options hinders it. But then, how do you deal with a Bulwark? The Vanguard and its grapnel launcher are an option, as latching onto an enemy stuns them for a moment, negating the Bulwark's shield as you go to work with the Combat Knife. Alternatively, the Jump Pack-equipped Assault class can more than hold its own, falling out of the sky like a comet before laying waste with the Thunder Hammer."
"Getting accustomed to each class's strengths and weaknesses takes time, especially when you also need to adjust to how different Eternal War feels compared to the rest of the game. First off, the time-to-kill is significantly shorter, disregarding the power fantasy of being a towering super soldier in favor of quicker skirmishes. You really need to take your vulnerability into account, as teams that stick together can easily steamroll those with players who venture off on their own. Secondly, there's much more of a focus on ranged combat. Melee combat--and its ability to ignore armor--is a high-risk, high-reward alternative. Being able to bypass armor is appealing, but you're probably putting yourself in the very thick of things by getting in range, so you need to weigh up when busting out the Chainsword is worth it."
"Eternal War isn't without its faults, however. The maps are bland, boxy arenas with little deviation in level design from one to the next. They lack the scale and spectacle of the campaign, opting instead for environments with no discernible features. The inclusion of Chaos Marines is also a misstep at launch due to the absence of cosmetics. It's disappointing to create your own squad of customized Space Marines only to be saddled with the default forces of Chaos for multiple games in a row. Although, I also encountered a bug where my cosmetic changes would randomly reset, so there are issues on both sides."
"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a more-than-worthy successor to the 2011 original. Its brutally gory action is as riveting as ever, but it's also more considered and tactile, making for a much more satisfying experience. There's not a lot going on outside of combat, and it's overly linear at times, but these flaws are easy to forget when you're charging headfirst into battle against an enemy numbering in the hundreds, furiously fighting against a stunning backdrop that brings the tabletop game to life in all its grimdark splendor. Space Marine 2 will deeply resonate with Warhammer 40,000 fans, yet it also has enough about it to thrill those who can't tell their Horus Heresy from their Macharian Crusade. The wait might've been long, but it was well worth it."
"Konami is trying to figure out how to make Silent Hill games again. After more than a decade away from the series (and arguably many more years since a good one), multiple new Silent Hill projects have recently debuted or soon shall. Silent Hill devotees like me often wonder whether the publisher can recapture the magic of the series' early games. But even if it can't, at least we have Hollowbody. Made by a single person, Hollowbody sometimes goes too far past being a homage, but most of the time, it stands apart as a memorable entry in the crowded space of horror games drumming up the past."
"This year, Hollowbody is the closest thing you'll find to Silent Hill 2 that isn't Bloober Team's forthcoming remake. Its solo developer, Nathan Hamley (working under the studio name Headware Games), admits his love for the series is the driving force in creating Hollowbody, and there are times when that adoration is even too obvious. Everything from how you explore its world and unlock new pathways by solving tricky puzzles to how you fight enemies and even unlock multiple endings all feel pulled from the PS2 classic. An early section of the third-person survival-horror game takes place in corridors that are so similar to Silent Hill 2's hospital section that it gave me deja vu, and the monsters that stalk just beyond the reach of your flashlight stumble into attacking you like that game's iconic nurses."
"There are even a few moments in which you come upon threateningly deep, dark holes that you drop into without knowing what's on the other side. One corridor, in particular, prompted me to ask myself the same question that Silent Hill 2's absurdly long stairwell previously prompted: ""How long is this thing?"" The callbacks border on copies at times, but Hollowbody doesn't settle for being merely a clone of the developer's favorite game--though it is fascinating to see how one person in 2024 can make something very much like a game that required a much larger team just a few decades ago."
"Within its mission statement of making a game much like SH2, it's the things Hollowbody does differently that made me more eager to play it than the many other games like it. I'm not typically nostalgic for games that play and look poorer than modern games tend to, but Hawley captures the essence of that era so well without clinging to the period's worst aspects. Tank controls, for example, are in the game, but they aren't in use by default. Masochists will need to toggle them on. Similarly, you do save periodically--at a landline phone rather than a bright red book, mind you--but there are a few autosaves in the game, too, usually before a tougher section."
"These modern conveniences do well to reduce frustrations that some similarly minded studios misidentify as valuable, though the legacy pain-point of running along walls, couches, beds, and cabinets seeking interaction points remains, so Hollowbody doesn't reject every questionable design quirk of its genre. On more than one occasion, I had to retread some areas several times before finding an item I needed to progress, which pulled me out of an otherwise moody scene."
"Combat in Hollowbody is very similar to the games that inspired it. That means it's best to avoid it or use melee weapons if you can, thus saving ammo. Whatever means of defense to which you resort, you'll often be navigating tight spaces, which make it challenging to flee even after you've made up your mind. The game uses a reliable auto-aim system with a green reticle that you can shift from enemy to enemy with ease."
"This makes staying alive easier than if you had to rely on guesswork, like some early-2000s horror games asked players to do. I was relieved to find that, despite this helpful mechanic, combat still elicited a welcome sense of dread, partly because the audiovisual cue when you take damage is so jarring that it felt almost like monsters were jumping off the screen in a sense. Enemies close the distance deceptively quickly, and the game's various melee weapons offer different animations, making them unequal in their reach, attack speed, and effectiveness--I recommend you stick with the guitar."
"The game's atmosphere is its best attribute, with a familiar low hum persisting through most of the story that consistently unnerved me during the four-hour experience. Like great horror developers who have come before, Hamley understands when to lean into the game's creepy, somber music, and when to let the silence commandeer a scene. Each frame of the game captures the spirit of PS2-era horror games so faithfully that if you knew nothing about the game, you might assume it's actually from 2001."
"Because the game is shorter than most of those it strives to resemble, some of the genre's staples are expedited in a way. Puzzles, for example, can be tricky, but never as maddening as Silent Hill 2's piano puzzle, and often the space and time between finding a puzzle-cracking item and putting it to use is small and short. I actually had to get used to how the pause menu's map would show me the way forward because I sometimes expected more roadblocks, even as an arrow would essentially tell me, ""Go here!"" It wasn't until the back half of the game that I started to trust that the map truly was just pointing me toward the next section, and even when there would be puzzles along the way to unlock that path, all interactable doors were similarly spotlighted on the map."
"Like the best Silent Hill games, Hollowbody isn't just scary; it's tragic, and the world you're exploring reminds you of that in every corner. Though even its narrative thread weaves a similar tale--you're seeking a lost loved one in an eerie town--the thematic elements help Hollowbody rise above facsimile in a manner that its darkened hallways and aggressive monsters sometimes don't allow. The story is actually set in the future, but the town you explore was abandoned years prior following an apparent bioterror attack. This means you leave a cyberpunk world early on and soon enter a dreary British town hamstrung not just by an attack decades before, but also due to gentrification and abandonment years before that."
"Documents scattered across town tell a background plot of townspeople promised an economic stimulus, only to have the rug pulled out from under them in the months and years to come by double-speaking investors. It's a familiar tale, but not owing to Silent Hill in this case. Instead, it's pulled from the headlines of the real world, and I appreciate the way Hamley is able to creatively tie an abandoned, monster-infested town to the theme of economic inequality."
"Hollowbody is scary, dreary, and sad; it's all the things I love about horror games. Sometimes, it embodies these feelings because it nearly repurposes the same monsters, places, and predicaments from the games that inspired it. But it's not all familiar, and the things it does differently are its best attributes, like telling a story conscious of and concerned about sociopolitics and offering a minimalistic but unsettling soundtrack of its own. Maybe the last great Silent Hill game is behind us. I don't know. But I do know its memory remains alive in successes like Hollowbody."
"For multiple console life cycles, PlayStation has fostered a brand built on gritty anti-heroes, fantastical worlds at conflict with themselves, and a trope colloquially referred to as ""sad dads."" I like most of those games and find the praise they receive in many cases to be well-earned, but Astro Bot is a reminder of another side to the PlayStation DNA. Not only does it feel like a revitalization of an important part of the brand, but it also feels like a spotlight shifting to a character who has been lurking in the background, previously unable to see over the hulking Kratos, the war-ready Aloy, or the tortured Joel. Team Asobi's Astro Bot quickly, consistently, and joyously launches its titular hero into the pantheon of all-time greats, both in its first-party family and genre, with a platformer whose incredible ambition is matched by its brilliant execution."
"Stranded in space following an attack from a googly-eyed alien, Astro's mission is to repair their ship and rescue all 300 pals scattered across five main clusters of planets, each composed of individual levels. Naturally, the story is not the focus here, and yet I was so immersed in the 15-hour game that I beat it in two long sittings. It may be 2024's most immersive game, and it achieves that without a line of dialogue. Instead, each level tells a story, clear as day, about where you ought to go next and what you should do there."
"There is both depth and breadth to most levels, and frequent checkpoints mean you'll rarely be punished for exploration or missing a jump. Levels take only five to 10 minutes in most cases, but are overflowing with personality. Robot animals climb trees along the periphery or jump out of the ocean far beneath the levitating worlds you explore. Everything constantly moves around you, imbuing every level with life beyond the scraps you'll engage in with the game's enemies. Each level's theme is brought to life with aesthetic assets and design ideas that strengthen their themes. During a Japan-themed level in which Astro can soak up water to become something like a giant squishy kaiju, you'll simply plow over enemies the robot would otherwise need to be wary of, topple bamboo walls as the ground shakes around you, and soak in hot springs, all while string music evokes the country's signature sounds."
"In another that sees Astro shrink to the size of a mouse, the miniature world reveals new woodsy and backyard-like scenery that regular-sized Astro couldn't reach. Because of the game's Smash Bros-like manner of bringing in dozens of familiar faces, some levels purposely evoke multiple games at once, like a desert level that is titled like and starts off like a Prince of Persia reference before ultimately ending with an ascent to a glorious mountaintop a la Journey. Some levels even drastically change the art style, as seen in a series of voxel-art levels I was glad to discover each time, or some others I dare not spoil."
"Numerous dazzling aesthetics in Astro Bot are somehow only used once or very little, like a casino level with bright multicolored lights and betting chips floating through the sky, or a level meant to look like a child-friendly haunted graveyard and nearby castle, which is among my favorites in the whole game but--again--somehow is featured just once. These assets surely take many human hours to make, and again, Astro Bot presents them with the confidence to wordlessly suggest, ""Yeah, we know these rule, but look what else we have for you,"" before the next level wipes the slate and starts anew with yet another never-before-seen aesthetic. I haven't seen a platformer marathon through so many varied, whimsical, and blatantly cool ideas like this before."
"My favorite aspect of the game is how it seems to read my mind. Every time I'd divert off the main path in search of a secret or reward, I would find one. Team Asobi understands its level-design concepts so well that it can reliably predict where and when players will get sidetracked, and it ensures there's always something waiting there for them, like a surprise gift in the mail whose sender can't wait to learn it's arrived. ""Can I climb this crane?"" I'd wonder to myself. Yes, I can, and for scaling it to the very top I'd find coins to spend on cosmetics. ""What if I peek over this ledge?"" There's a hidden cave below, hiding another puzzle piece used to open shops in the game's hub world. Whenever I'd wonder if my intuition was leading me to something valuable, I'd find I was right."
"In tandem with expert level design are the game's diverse and exciting mechanics. At the start of nearly every level, Astro jumps into a suit or straps on a backpack of some kind that gives them a new ability. In one level, it's spring-powered boxing gloves resembling cartoon frogs. In another, it's a robo-dog that gives the bipedal bot a wall-smashing rocket boost, or in another, a time-freezing tool that allows Astro to scale otherwise impossibly fast-moving sections. Across the game's dozens of levels, you'll see many abilities like these, and in nearly every case, they are a resounding success."
"While some abilities are more fun than others, they nearly all work seamlessly. As Astro, you'll strap on the ability and intuitively understand it. You sense its limitations and use cases immediately, and though the game disposes of abilities at an uncommon pace, many will resurface later in a new setting or be used to defeat the game's fun bosses--including a final boss and credits sequence that will surely go down as one of 2024's best video game moments."
"Even within a level, an ability is used in several different and creative ways, but always stemming from its singular mechanic featured in that level. It ramps up the platforming and combat sequences via an approachable but challenging incline and chains these little moments together in such a way that there's never a lull in any level. Whereas many platformers may drill down on a key feature or small set of features, Astro Bot displays confidence by often disposing of exciting new tools shortly after introducing them. It expresses iteration in cycles of five minutes each, rather than iterating on one idea for five or more hours, which I find both refreshing and bold. The only other game I've seen that's similarly willing to dispose of cool ideas like this is It Takes Two, and Astro Bot does it more often and with more enjoyable mechanics."
"Like any excellent platformer, Astro Bot's movement feels responsive and trustworthy. Despite the game consistently giving you new ways to traverse its puzzling pathways, you'll almost always feel like you have a good grip on clearing gaps, timing attacks on enemies, and dodging bosses with expertise. The camera caused a few rare instances of what felt like selling me out, but the game's checkpoints are so numerous and the load times are virtually non-existent, such that this never became a pain point for me."
"The only ability that doesn't work as cleanly as others is the one used in an underwater level. Meant to mimic a dolphin-like dive ability, the controls used for this one never feel as intuitive as those for other abilities. In this level, I found it unusually tricky, albeit not exactly difficult, to collect all the secrets. A few of them demanded a deft diving ability the backpack is meant to offer, but it doesn't have the same accuracy of other abilities in the game, which led me to whiff on some sections in a way that was unique to this level. It was manageable, but if any secret levels--which tend to be some of the game's hardest--also use this mechanic, I expect them to become some of the game's few frustrations."
"In the few instances where the hero isn't wearing an ability, the game still finds ways to reinvent itself. A mid-game level that evokes the kid-friendly vibes of a preschool presents a clever day-and-night-switching mechanic that tosses the world on its side back and forth whenever you press a button, allowing Astro to solve puzzles and reach the end. But once that awesome level was finished, I never saw the mechanic used again. Astro Bot feels like it's showing off at times, but never in a way that pats itself on its back. It's ceaselessly cute and clever, and feels more like a little kid delighted to show you their toy collection than a braggart displaying their trophies."
"Each galaxy you arrive in houses several secrets to uncover in the overworld, and even levels themselves have hidden bonus stages. This game's secrets have secrets, with more hidden levels being revealed at a steady clip whenever you inch closer to polishing off each galaxy's to-do list. The best of those secrets are the hidden bots themselves. There are 300 in total, though you only need 200 to face the final boss, and over half of them are dressed up as iconic characters from video game history. Many of these are first-party heroes, like Ellie and a Gran Turismo racer, but many others are cameos of characters from series closely tied to PlayStation's past, such as Tomb Raider, Persona, or even classic and contemporary indies like Journey, Stray, and Humanity."
"Each bot you find returns to the (mostly) safe zone, the Crash Site, which acts like a hub world you can explore and decorate. Here, the game carries forward the same PlayStation Museum vibe seen in Astro's Playroom, albeit to a lesser extent. You won't explore past PlayStation consoles, but the mothership you're trying to repair is just a giant PS5, and the spaceship you use to explore the overworld is a DualSense controller with wings. It feels a bit like that meme of Obama awarding Obama a medal, but it's not distracting, so ultimately, it's fine."
"Spending coins in the game's shop unlocks dioramas, ship paints, and costumes for Astro, even some based on unexpected series such as Bloodborne and Gravity Rush. The dioramas are especially fun, as they turn all your collected bots into animated statues, like one that shows Nathan Drake playing a game called Dude Raider on his couch. Even the most serious of characters are turned into caricatures, like a scene you can create in which The Last of Us' Joel goes to throw a brick, but it slips out of his hand and bonks him on the head. All of the 169 cameo bots fill in the would-be barren desert sands like a virtual shelf of Funko Pops."
"Finding each of these characters is a constant highlight of Astro Bot. Some are placed right in front of you, but most require the aforementioned curiosity to pull you off the beaten path in search of the game's bountiful secrets. One of the best mechanics--which I very much hope becomes standard in the genre moving forward--is a robot bird companion who can join you in any level you decide to replay. The bird pings for collectibles and leads you right to the remaining bots, secret Void levels, and puzzle pieces you've not yet found. This makes playing the game to 100% completion a joy and never a grind. I've never cared about PlayStation Trophies before, but I expect to unlock them all in Astro Bot, if only incidentally because I want to see and do everything this game offers."
"It seems odd to say I don't want to spoil a game that effectively has no story, but some of the game's best secrets really must be discovered with your own eyes. To talk around Astro Bot's most entertaining of these surprises, I'll mention that it will occasionally rethink its mechanics as a whole, nearly swapping genres at times, in ways that pay homage to PlayStation's illustrious past. These special levels arrive toward the end of each galaxy's main mission path and bestow to you a bundle of themed bots as well as yet another cool new mechanic not to be seen ever again in the game. Its soundtrack--already an array of bubbly earworms--reimagines familiar overtures from other games. In doing all of this for these most-special one-offs, the promise of its world comes into full view. Astro Bot swarms the player with bright ideas, sparking almost endless joy."
"Astro Bot is also meant to be a DualSense showcase, and it certainly does a lot there, though I continue to feel like the controller's most passionate fans are within the company itself. I don't mind the DualSense, but I don't feel like much would be lost if I played the game without features like secondary noises coming out of my controller, blowing air into it to propel a fan, or using the gyroscopic motion controls to physically repair the ship each time I finished a galaxy and found another elusive ship part."
"Its best attribute, a rumble feature more nuanced than what other controllers provide, is also simpler than all of the DualSense's high-end abilities that sometimes come off as gimmicky. Astro Bot also did away with some of them from Astro's Playroom, such as using the center touchpad to unzip some blockades. Instead, this is done with the joystick, suggesting Team Asobi found it best to keep players' hands off the somewhat clunky touchpad this time around."
"Beyond the underwater level that doesn't shine the way others do, my only other frustrations with Astro Bot come in the form of some of the game's hardest levels, which will likely be too difficult for younger or less-experienced players. Normally, these levels are as brief as 30 seconds, but they require perfection and give the game a taste of trial-and-error it otherwise consciously rejects."
"I understand the game is split into tiers, allowing most anyone to be able to beat the base game before the diehards go the extra mile, but since several cameo characters are locked behind these ultra-hard mini-levels, it's a bit of a letdown that some of the game's younger fans may likely never find all of the must-have bots to bring back to their hub world. In this way, Astro Bot gates a small but not insignificant portion of its best material behind a skill check that some of its audience won't pass."
"The game also crashed on me twice, both times erasing more progress than I'd have expected since I assumed it auto-saves after each level, but I'd lost about three or four levels of progress in both instances. However, I admit these crashes came at the end of my long 11-hour session with the game on my first day with it, so maybe it was an issue Team Asobi will address. Still, the hard crash backpedaling on my saved data was strange and somewhat soured what was a marathon of smiles for about 10 hours of that day."
"The simply titled Astro Bot is meant to be the cute robot's first significant foray into video games following a 2018 VR exclusive that earned praise but was stuck in its headset-only bubble, and a 2020 pack-in tech demo that hinted at more to come. The beauty of the game, as suggested by its title, is that even players returning for their third Astro adventure will find hours upon hours of new experiences, collectively and magnificently presented as a parade of joyous sights, sounds, and adventures. This is a grand re-opening for Astro Bot, and it surely marks the start of what is destined to be a beloved series shooting for the moon."
"World of Warcraft: The War Within makes a hell of a first impression. Within the expansion's first 10 minutes, one of the Warcraft universe's greatest heroes, the archmage Khadgar, is seemingly vaporized. Moments later, one of WoW's most iconic cities, Dalaran, is obliterated. You wake up amidst the wreckage, search for survivors, fend off attacks from the spider-like Nerubians, and then set out on a journey deeper and deeper into Azeroth's depths to find the one responsible for the carnage--WoW's new big bad, Xal'atath."
"It's a bold opening for the 10th expansion in WoW's two-decade history--one that almost reads as a signal to past and present WoW players that Blizzard is looking to up the narrative stakes as it moves forward. The War Within kicks off what is billed as the first part of a three-expansion storyline called the Worldsoul Saga, which will look to bring together many of the game's core plotlines from over the years, as the MMO nears its 20th anniversary."
"It's only fitting then that The War Within builds brilliantly on what came before, not only from a story perspective but also in continuing many of the trends and design philosophies that helped make the game's previous expansion, Dragonflight, the course-correction WoW desperately needed. The War Within realizes many of those ideas to something close to their full potential, giving the expansion a ""been there, done that"" feel at first that quickly subsides once it becomes clear just how dramatically those ideas, whether it's account-wide progression or the ability to do endgame content entirely solo, change the way Blizzard's MMORPG is played. While not every new feature is a home run, namely Hero Talents, The War Within is otherwise laser-focused in its execution of letting players play WoW the way they want to, and in that it overwhelmingly succeeds."
World Of Warbands
"That's no small feat. Like in Dragonflight, Blizzard opted to forgo one-off expansion features this time around and instead focus on recurring ones that will be WoW staples for the foreseeable future. The biggest this time around is Warbands, a bit of a catch-all feature that encompasses and fully fleshes out many of the baby-step account-wide progression features Blizzard previously rolled out, both in Dragonflight and in expansions prior. Now, nearly everything is shared across a player's account rather than limited to a specific character. Items, some gear, and currencies can easily be transferred between characters on the same account. Renown and reputation gains, long one of the most frustrating parts of making and progressing a new character, are now shared across all characters on an account. Many aspects of the game that were already somewhat account-wide, like achievements and a player's transmog collection, have been expanded even further here, with players now able to earn weapon and armor appearances regardless of if their current character can use those items."
"It's hard to overstate how much of a game-changer this is. For the first time in my long history of playing WoW, I began to level up an alternate character immediately after completing the story campaign on my main. While playing my alt, quests already completed by my main can be conveniently hidden on the map, letting me better hone in on other side quests I skipped initially. All of the achievement progress, quest-reward gear appearances, upgrade currencies, and Renown earned from doing these side quests are account-wide, meaning that even though I'm leveling a completely different character, my main character is still benefiting. Even if it feels long overdue, now that it's finally here, it's hard to fathom how WoW players endured 20 years of character-locked progression."
Journey To The Center Of Azeroth
"The changes Warbands bring make just about any progress meaningful progress. That progress, in turn, makes seeking out all of the sights and sounds of The War Within's new Khaz Algar region even more rewarding than it would be otherwise. Home of the new playable race, the Earthen, Khaz Algar is a series of four zones. The one players find themselves in following Dalaran's destruction, the Isle of Dorn, is on Azeroth's surface: a lush, green biome filled with familiar dwarven architecture. A massive underground tunnel, the Coreway, connects it to the game's next zone, the mines of the Ringing Deeps. That zone, in turn, is connected to two other zones: Hallowfall and the Nerubian kingdom of Azj-Kahet."
"WoW zones within an expansion have always largely been traversable without loading screens, but there is something extremely satisfying about being able to hop on your flying mount (which can now be controlled in the same way as Dragonflight's dragonriding mounts), leap from the Earthen city of Dornogal, nosedive into the Coreway, and find yourself in a vast, subterranean world, all without interruption. This might be the best collection of zones ever introduced in a WoW expansion. Each one stands tall in its own way, with varied scenery, zone-specific events, and interesting storylines, but two stand out to me in particular: Azj-Kahet and Hallowfall."
"Azj-Kahet in many ways feels like an updated version of Suramar from 2016's Legion expansion, as players work with a Nerubian resistance group to overthrow an evil queen. Like Suramar, there is even a sprawling city, the City of Threads, to explore--filled with quests, patrolling guards, and a corresponding dungeon that is an instanced version of the city. It definitely feels familiar, but given that slowly progressing through Suramar to wrench the city from the clutches of its corrupted ruler in Legion's endgame was one of that expansion's highlights, I'm happy to see the formula repeated here. While Azj-Kahet is largely focused on the Nerubians, there is also a mysterious new race--the dark troll-like Haranir--that exists in the shadows of the zone. Despite one appearing in a cinematic trailer, they are a relatively small presence in the game at launch, and I'm curious to see what role the Haranir play in the months ahead."
"Entering the massive cavern of Hallowfall for the first time as part of the main campaign almost feels like stepping into an entirely new expansion, evoking a feeling similar to emerging from the sewers of the Imperial City and venturing into Cyrodiil at the start of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion or stepping into Hyrule for the first time in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Blizzard's art team has truly outdone itself here: Airships dot the skies, and a massive light-emitting crystal makes the zone appear not as if it was deep underground but on the surface. When that crystal transforms in real time from emitting holy energy to being shrouded in the darkness of the void, the zone takes on an entirely different feeling. Hallowfall is home to the Arathi Expedition, an offshoot of a long-hidden empire. Though the dwarf-like Earthen are billed as the game's newest culture and playable race, it's the Arathi, many of whom are half-elves, who steal the show. I found myself hooked on learning more about them, their culture, and the mysterious empire from which they hail."
"That's not to say the Earthen aren't full of their own surprises. If I'm being honest, I wasn't very excited about the rock-dwarves when they were first revealed. They've been glimpsed in WoW before and nothing about them initially made me eager to learn more, much less create an Earthen character. I'm happy to report that they are far more interesting than they appear to be at first glance: a culture divided into those who still serve their Titan creators and those who seek their own path. Due to their almost mechanical nature and long-lasting lives, many Earthen storylines revolve around memory, as the Earthen are periodically reborn and their memories essentially overwritten. Some reject this fate and opt to die a natural death of sorts, while others are forced to come to terms with essentially starting life over. One of the expansion's most touching, and potentially tear-jerking, questlines revolves around an elderly Earthen losing their memory and preparing for the end of their life. They enlist you to help them make one final journey, and along the way you watch their mind and memory fade, and the effect it has both on them and their caregiver. It's an emotional quest, especially for those who have found themselves having to watch a loved one go through a similar experience, as I and many others have. Blizzard handles it with a deft hand, and it will be a story I remember for a long, long time."
For The Alliance
"Story is one of The War Within's strong suits. Whereas Dragonflight was a welcome reprieve from the game's much-hated Shadowlands expansion (with its convoluted lore revolving around afterlives, Arbiters, and whatever the Jailer's deal was), Dragonflight also felt largely inconsequential and disconnected from WoW's larger narrative and many of its most prominent characters. That's not the case with The War Within, which immediately takes a major player off the board and establishes Xal'atath, shrugging off an arcane kamehameha with hardly a scratch like she's a Dragon Ball Z villain. Xal'atath has come a long way from her origins as a talking knife in Legion, and even if her ability to seemingly be invulnerable is a little one-note so far, she is scary and ruthless in a way a Warcraft villain hasn't been since the likes of Garrosh. I'm excited to see how every WoW player's favorite ""knaifu"" develops over the course of The Worldsoul Saga, it having been confirmed she won't be a ""one and done"" expansion villain."
"Whereas many of WoW's most-important characters were, for the most part, MIA in Dragonflight's campaign, they take center stage here, though Horde players are likely to be disappointed. Much of The War Within focuses on Alleria Windrunner, Magni Bronzebeard, and Anduin Wrynn, who are each struggling with their own internal demons in the face of yet another crisis on Azeroth. They are all Alliance characters, leaving the former Horde warchief Thrall, who is only present in the main story's opening moments before leaving to gather reinforcements, as the only Horde representation. I won't spoil much, but excluding Thrall (and Jaina Proudmoore, who also appears briefly at the start), each character undergoes a personal journey and comes out the other side with a new perspective. It's not exactly groundbreaking stuff, but it is nice to see the story of someone like Magni, who has been stuck in character-development hell for over half a decade as Azeroth's Speaker, move forward in a meaningful way. It's just a shame Blizzard couldn't find a Horde character to put a spotlight on over the course of the main story, though post-campaign story quests have already put more of a focus on Thrall and other Horde characters than the campaign itself does."
"How Blizzard's latest tells its story is also worth mentioning, as it's a serious step up even from Dragonflight. The main story itself is relatively short but moves at a steady pace as players progress through each zone in a linear fashion, sprinkled with far more in-engine cutscenes than in previous expansions. Each cutscene demonstrates just how far Blizzard's storytelling has come in recent years, with greatly improved character models and animations. The main story even takes players directly through modified versions of some of the game's dungeons thanks to the recent addition of NPC Follower dungeons--a first for a WoW expansion and a move that makes the game's overarching story and that of many of its dungeons feel more interwoven than in previous expansions. On subsequent characters, players can play the campaign in any order, or just ignore it and focus on side quests and world quests. Players will need to supplement the game's campaign quests with side quests and content in order to reach max level on their first character, and that's where many of The War Within's best narrative moments can be found."
"Many NPCs now include additional dialogue options lore-hungry players can use to learn more about Khaz Algar's people and their cultures. Some of my favorite (and completely optional) quests simply involve sitting at a table talking with various characters, whether it's chatting with Anduin and Faerin Lothar while learning an Arathi board game or joining in on an Arathi family dinner. In addition, many NPCs in main quests and prominent side-quest chains feature a ""Stay awhile and listen"" option that, when selected, plays out an extra, extended dialogue scene between characters. This option isn't strictly new for this expansion, but it is used far more frequently, and to much greater effect, than the handful of times it's appeared in the past. Though they are entirely optional, these dialogue scenes deliver some of The War Within's most-memorable beats, like Magni bonding with his grandson Dagran or Alleria being reunited with her partner. Rather than simply speeding through quests as quickly as possible (as I have been guilty of doing in the past), I found myself clicking every dialogue option and always opting to ""stay awhile,"" which helped me become even more invested in the game's cast of characters and its new setting."
Delving Into Endgame
"Beyond improvements to storytelling, Blizzard has clearly recognized that there is a sizable number of WoW players who aren't into pushing Mythic dungeon keys or raiding with a group of 20 strangers in order to gear up and progress through WoW's endgame--a formula that has largely stayed the same since 2016's Legion expansion. Enter Delves: a new form of endgame content that can be done entirely solo (or with a group)."
"It's too early to say how Delves will pan out long-term given that only three out of 11 total difficulty options are currently available, but so far they are largely a good time. Each of the game's 12 Delves at launch sees players battling their way through a 10-15-minute scenario with varied objectives and modifiers, whether it's rescuing trapped miners or finding specific items. Some of the Delve-specific mechanics are more enjoyable than others. One somewhat annoying underwater Delve requires players to seek out air bubbles lest they drown, while another tasks players with avoiding spider-webs on the ground that, when stepped on, will summon more enemies. There are variants of each Delve too, and each culminates in a boss fight, after which there is a treasure room of rewards for players to collect. Defeating rare mobs inside a Delve will reward players with a temporary power similar to the ones seen in Torghast or occasionally used in various activities in Dragonflight, giving players an additional edge that I'm sure will be more necessary at higher difficulties. Within a Delve, players are accompanied by an NPC companion who will change seasonally. At launch, it's dwarven explorer Brann Bronzebeard, who can be assigned a healer or damage-dealing role and customized with various abilities."
"Delves aren't as inventive or visually exciting as the game's tried-and-true dungeons, of which there are some true standouts this time around, like one that sees players darting from various airships to repel a Nerubian attack or another set in a massive cathedral that brings to mind the game's old Scarlet Monastery dungeons. Delves are, however, extremely easy at lower difficulties, though I'm sure that's something that will change once the higher tiers are unlocked. As an endgame activity for largely solo players to gear up and earn rewards, it seems like they will get the job done and accomplish their goal of being bite-sized adventures players can squeeze in when short on time while still offering meaningful rewards."
Talent Show
"If there is one new addition in The War Within that doesn't quite land, it's Hero Talents. These sub-specializations (two for each spec) aim to bring even more power to players while delivering on some of Warcraft's long-established fantasies, whether it's becoming a Dark Ranger Hunter or a Rider of the Apocalypse Deathknight. Each Hero Talent tree features 10 nodes, all of which players will have unlocked at the new max level of 80. In each tree are a handful of nodes that give players the option to select between two choices."
"While often visually impressive (I will never get tired of seeing a Pit Lord stick its head out of the Twisting Nether to blast my foes as a Diabolist Warlock), from a gameplay perspective Hero Talents leave plenty to be desired. Players have very few choices to make within the trees themselves, and each tree largely consists of passive skills that modify existing abilities. Of the Hero Talents I've been able to use and look through, it appears the majority of Hero Talent trees don't alter the way you play your character in any significant way. That's certainly true in the case of the four Hero Talent trees I tried as a Retribution Paladin and Demonology Warlock."
"Balance is also an issue, as it seems like many Hero Talent specs are simply better than the alternative for any given specialization. That was the case for Retribution and Demonology, where the strong visuals and power that came from the Templar and Diabolist Hero Talents far outshined the respective alternative options, Herald of the Sun and Soul Harvester. That makes for an unpleasant scenario where a player may really like the particular class fantasy of one Hero Talent specialization but feel forced to pick a different one in order to be competitive in endgame activities. Damage numbers and the like can be tuned in the weeks ahead to make lacking Hero Talent specs more competitive, but it still seems like a misfire in an expansion that is otherwise on-point."
"As for the rest of The War Within, PvP players are finally thrown a bone in the form of a new PvP battleground, Deephaul Ravine. It's the first new battleground introduced since 2018, and one that is most similar to Mists of Pandaria's Silvershard Mines. Two teams battle to escort two carts to their destination in order to score points, while the team that captures the crystal (aka flag) found in the middle of the symmetrical map will earn points as well. Having played a few rounds of the new battleground, I'm impressed by its simplicity. The map itself is small, meaning players are almost constantly in the action. However, the map does feature more verticality than most WoW battlegrounds, with players able to battle it out atop (or shoot down from) an elevated minecart rail that cuts through the center of the map. That adds an extra bit of strategy, as it's on top of the bridge where abilities that can displace enemies truly shine, allowing you to knock foes down to the ground below, causing them to take fall damage."
"With some truly impressive new zones, top-notch presentation in both art direction and music, a renewed emphasis on storytelling and characters, a whole new form of endgame content in Delves, full-fledged account-wide progression, and even a new PvP battleground for the first time in six years, The War Within is the complete WoW package. Though it may be lacking in a big, expansion-specific feature, the evergreen features it does add change the game dramatically for the better. Even if Hero Talents, both in concept and execution, don't quite stick the landing, many of them do at least look extremely cool, which isn't nothing in a game where the true endgame for many players is to look as stylish as possible. The fact that they are intended to be a core part of the game going forward means Blizzard will have time to get balancing right and hopefully up the, ahem, ""wow factor"" of underwhelming Hero Talent specs, but it is a shame that they don't make a bigger splash right out of the gate."
"The War Within marks not only the start of The Worldsoul Saga, but the beginning of what seems like a new era of WoW. All the old staples--Mythic+ dungeons, raids, PvP, world quests-- are still there, but the game's newfound focus on letting you play how you want to play, rather than forcing you to play a certain way, makes it a far more enjoyable experience. Blizzard is finally meeting players where they are, not where it wants them to be, and that means whether you like to focus on one character or play many--solo or with a guild--there is something here for you. The War Within is WoW at its most approachable, and it's all the better for it."
"In Outlaws, you play as Kay Vess, an up-and-coming mercenary who finds herself becoming an outlaw after a job goes poorly and a high-stakes bounty called a death mark is placed on her. To escape the bounty, Kay finds herself thrust into the position of putting together a crew to break into the near-impenetrable vault of the man who wants her dead--without any money, he won't be able to pay for the bounty hunters on her tail. Her attempts to put together the perfect team take her across the Outer Rim of the galaxy, always accompanied by the latest in Star Wars' long procession of Weird Little Guys, the adorably axolotl-like Nix. In her adventures, Kay regularly comes into contact or conflict with four criminal organizations--the Pyke Syndicate, Crimson Dawn, the Hutt Cartel, and the Ashiga Clan--as well as the Rebel Alliance and Galactic Empire, the latter of which is hunting down the former following the events of The Empire Strikes Back."
"Even ignoring the obvious shortcoming--Kay is yet another human protagonist in a sea of Star Wars games, movies, and TV shows that also feature a human protagonist--Kay is just not that interesting. A common narrative throughline for Outlaws is that Kay is aimless and doesn't know what she wants for her future, not even having any plans for how to spend the millions she'll have once her crew has stolen from the man who wants her dead. The other characters like to remind Kay about this a lot, which in turn acts as a frequent prompt to the player that you're embodying someone with no apparent aspirations or goals. That's a character who's hard to relate to and even harder to write for, as is evident by the lack of any clear arc to Kay's story. There are moments where the game seems to posit that the story has changed Kay, but there's no build-up to any of them and so they ultimately feel narratively confusing or sudden and unfulfilling. When the credits rolled, I wasn't convinced that Kay had actually undergone any sort of personal growth. The Kay at the end of the game largely talks and acts like the one at the beginning, save for an appreciation for her new teammates (and I'm still unclear as to why she likes them). And if the main character hasn't grown at all, then what were the past 30 hours of story for?"
"Typically, this wouldn't be too much of an issue for me. A lot of Star Wars games have bland protagonists with wonky character arcs (Cal Kestis in Fallen Order, for example, or Iden Versio in Battlefront 2) but these are offset with a deeply compelling or intriguing supporting character (Merrin in Fallen Order and Del Meeko in Battlefront 2). Outlaws doesn't have that crutch, as the supporting cast around Kay isn't all that interesting. BX-series droid commando ND-5--an initially cold robotic slave ordered to watch over Kay who warms up to her and becomes a friend by the story's conclusion--is a strong contender, especially given a late-game story development that almost (but doesn't quite) tilt Outlaws into a horror-like narrative space that could have been very interesting. But the way the game writes Kay and ND-5's relationship feels overly rushed. The story doesn't earn the two characters becoming partners, which is at the core of ND-5's arc."
"The best part about Outlaws' story (and the game in general) is the sound design. Everyone who had a part in the creation of the musical score or the design of the sound effects used for the blasters, speeders, ships, or environmental murmurs deserves all the accolades. Outlaws sounds quintessentially Star Wars, beating out the gold standard of Respawn's Jedi games. The orchestral surge as Kay takes off into space and activates her ship's hyperdrive for the first time is sublime, and I was positively buzzing with adrenaline as the distinct hum of Kay's blaster cooling and Nix's excited squeals broke through the triumphant horns that signaled I had held my own against a truly staggering number of Imperial soldiers. Perfectly jumping off a ramp in a speeder to circumnavigate an Imperial roadblock rewarded me with an intense burst of speed that I swear I could feel in my bones as I heard Kay's speeder initially shudder from the impact before she pressed the throttle and the engine's normally comforting hum briefly escalated into a dangerous whir. For as many issues that I have with this game, there are twice as many moments where the music and sound effects briefly transported me into the world of Star Wars, and I haven't been that immersed in the franchise in decades. The music and sound design is superb."
"That said, Outlaws positions itself as a lot of things and doesn't follow through on most of them. The story implies this will be a heist--grab the crew, make a plan, do the job--but there's very little of that. The gameplay points to Outlaws being a stealth game, as Kay has no Force powers or fancy body armor and relies on Nix to distract guards or security cameras, but she is so skilled with a blaster that unless you put the game on harder difficulties, she can quite handily mow through legions of Storm Troopers or criminal armies and forgo stealth entirely. The inclusion of a ship seems to indicate that space battles will be a pillar of the experience, but the ship handles poorly and space battles are an unexciting slog--barring a couple of mandatory moments, the game allows you to avoid space altogether, and that's for the better. And a relationship tracker that provides updates on Kay's fluctuating status with the four criminal syndicates indicates that who you have alliances with and animosity against impacts how Kay is perceived. But barring one unrewarding moment right at the end of the story, it doesn't. It affects which areas of the different hubs you can interact with and which outfits you unlock, but neither fundamentally affects the experience of playing the game. It's underwhelming how little Kay has a hand in influencing the four-way crime war at the center of the game's story, and it's irritating to watch your attempts at making big choices repeatedly deflate into unfulfilling narrative consequences."
"For example, I opted to side with Crimson Dawn on every issue, regardless of morality, which kept Kay's relationship with them at Excellent and lowered both the Pykes and Hutts to Poor (the Ashiga surprisingly remained at Good despite no attempt on Kay's part to help them outside of one mandatory story mission that forces her to). And so Kay's relationship with Crimson Dawn was at the highest it could be by the time I reached Kijimi, a planet where the Crimson Dawn and Ashiga Clan are in conflict. Crimson Dawn leadership acted like they had no idea who I was, however. So in a final bid to try and have some sort of impact on the story, I made a drastic decision at the end of that particular arc. Leading up to the conclusion, the bombmaker that Kay had been trying to recruit told Kay that she'd join Kay's crew if Kay did the right thing and sided with the Ashiga. Other characters also told Kay how bad it would be for the Ashiga if Kay did not side with them, and how not doing that might destroy their clan from the inside out. I still chose Crimson Dawn anyway...and a fairly prominent character died. I was frothing with excitement--at last, here was a moment where my poor actions would have a consequence! But it didn't. The bombmaker joined my crew anyway. Kay had a two-minute meltdown about having a hand in someone dying and then dropped the subject, never to be brought up again. Crimson Dawn, meanwhile, never factored into the story after that, so my decision for Kay to blindly stay loyal to them had no impact."
"In the end, completing optional assignments to boost Kay's favor with the various syndicates on the tracker is just there to give you more stuff to do. And if all you want is more, then you'll probably like aspects of Outlaws like the relationship tracker more than I did. But it's all so deflating how little impact that has on the game's story and gameplay. Outlaws is a beautiful game that sounds great and manages to capture these delightful moments of one person enjoying the smaller elements of the multitude of cultures in Star Wars, but then the gameplay and story fall short when it comes to differentiating the four criminal enterprises that define much of Kay's adventure. Their soldiers all fight pretty much the same, their bases contain vendors that sell similar items, and their bosses all initially regard Kay with a cool indifference that usually softens into a more ""You're alright kid"" vibe as the story goes on. Your experience playing Outlaws is virtually the same no matter who you support or betray, leaving those choices feeling hollow and narratively unsatisfying."
"Combat, at least, is more exciting, and when combat breaks out, Kay is a capable gunslinger. Armed with a blaster that can deftly switch between four distinct shots on the fly (stun blast, standard fire, electrified shots, and a powerful blast), Kay can react to pretty much any situation in front of her. Nix can be commanded to fetch the fallen firearms in the midst of a fight, letting Kay temporarily wield more powerful rifles, snipers, and grenade launchers too. And when Kay has done enough cool stuff in a row (stealth takedowns, successful kills, things like that), she can build up enough adrenaline to unleash a special move during which time briefly slows and she can mark off several targets to take out in a split second."
"Kay handles just fine, no less agile than the frontrunners in other action-adventure games like Tomb Raider's Lara Croft or Horizon Zero Dawn's Aloy. But Kay can handle most threats by staying in place and keeping behind cover. Unless you put Outlaws on a harder difficulty, firefights are only a passing challenge. They take more brain power than stealth encounters (which we'll touch on in a bit) because you have to react more quickly, but the enemy AI isn't very smart--often I could just wait behind cover and let the enemies blindly charge me, making them easy targets. These fights are cheap easy thrills--there's nothing groundbreaking about Outlaws' combat mechanics, but they aren't bad by any means either."
"The main crux of Outlaws gameplay, however, is stealth encounters. Kay regularly has to sneak inside somewhere to find someone or something or escape an enemy base without being seen. The gameplay is fine. Kay can direct Nix to distract guards or cameras or use takedowns or the stun setting on her blaster to silently knock out enemies. There's even grass for her to hide in and whistle from to attract the hapless guards, akin to Assassin's Creed, and air ducts to crawl through."
"It all works as intended, but there's not much that feels rewarding in it. The enemy AI is egregiously dumb, returning to normal patrol patterns after investigating disturbances for only a few moments or falling for the same distraction over and over. Lots of enemies in these missions stand still facing a computer (making them easy to sneak up on) or patrol in mapped patterns (making them easy to predict). The experience feels less like solving a puzzle, and more like being told an obvious solution. Is that a camera? Send Nix to distract. Are those two guards patrolling close to bushes? Hide and whistle them over one at a time to take them out. No way to reach the guard on the far-off platform? Wait for the stun gun to recharge and then take him out from a distance. The order of operations changes from mission to mission, but the solutions to each step of the stealth encounters rarely change, making it feel unrewarding to ""figure them out."" You don't have to think critically or strategically to get through them."
"I say ""rarely changes"" because there are two adjustments Outlaws makes in the final hours of the game that break the established flow and force you to think about how to move forward. The first is a one-and-done experience where Kay has to go through a story mission without Nix, removing the ability to distract from a distance. That was fun, but it didn't last as Outlaws promptly returned to its normal gameplay format. The other change is more substantial, however. Near the end of the game's story, Kay gets into more encounters where being detected is an instant fail state, meaning you can't just blast everyone away if you fail to stay hidden (unless you are exceptionally quick on the draw). In addition to that, more heavy enemies are introduced. These foes cannot be stun-gunned down, nor can Kay do a silent takedown on them without grabbing an optional upgrade. And, if alerted to Kay's presence, their big healthbars make them hard to take down, allowing them to overwhelm and easily stop Kay before she can prevent anyone from reaching the alarm."
"The more regular inclusion of these enemies do a great job of showcasing what Outlaws could have been, where Kay can't easily take out everyone in a room and is a lone woman against very high odds. The enemies are still pretty dumb in these instances and the path forward is still linear, but there's an underlying tension to these encounters that doesn't exist earlier on because sometimes the obvious answer forward is one you don't have. The game might be saying, ""This is where you stealth takedown this enemy and stun blast the other,"" but if both are heavies that are immune to both options, then you have to be a little creative in how to get past them. I really enjoyed the stealth encounters in the final 10 hours of Outlaws because of that. However, my enjoyment waned once I went to unlock the optional upgrade that allowed Kay to silently take down these high-endurance targets. Once that was done, the stealth encounters became a cakewalk again. In hindsight, I shouldn't have done it."
"I don't regret the effort I put into unlocking the ability, however. Outlaws does not have a traditional skill tree where Kay unlocks new abilities by earning points. Instead, Kay can hear rumors about Experts hidden in the world and then, using those clues, track these people down to wherever they're hiding on one of the various planets. After befriending these Experts, they'll clue Kay in to challenges she can complete for them--killing enemies in a certain way, for instance, or finding a particular item--and upon doing so, Kay unlocks additional abilities and upgrades that add more options to her toolbelt. Proving that she's adaptable enough to take down threats after distracting them lets Kay unlock the Merchant's ability to fast-talk enemies who spot her so they hesitate before shooting her or sounding the alarm, for example, and completing a challenge for the Mechanic can give Kay access to smoke bombs to break line of sight."
"These challenges add a degree of optional complexity to Outlaws' gameplay, introducing small goals that you can keep in the back of your mind while in the midst of a firefight or slinking through a restricted area. Save for the handful the story forces you to unlock, none of these additional abilities are mandatory for beating the game, but completing the challenges to unlock them introduces entertaining tests of skill. They can also lead you to gorgeous vistas and secret wonders that hide the components an Expert sometimes tells you that you need to nab. These tasks aren't narratively rewarding, but their inclusion does improve the gameplay by encouraging you to mix things up a little throughout the 30-hour runtime."
"Going off the beaten path to complete these challenges also helps you see more of Outlaws' handful of worlds. Save for Kijimi (which is mostly just one hub), each of the planets is a collection of hub spaces connected by an open-world. Kay is free to explore these spaces at her leisure, though the story is written in a way that really only affords that agency on Toshara, the second planet and where Kay's adventure truly begins. Once you leave Toshara, the story keeps ramping up and it's repeatedly implied that Kay is running out of time to clear her name. This is all arbitrary, of course, and you have as much time as you want to, but I found myself engaging with the side content and exploring the open worlds less and less as the game progressed and the narrative tension continued to ramp up. Thankfully, it's still all there once the credits roll, so if a particular side quest interests you but the game pressured you (like me) into feeling like you didn't have time for it, it will still be waiting for you once Kay's adventure wraps up."
"Still, it's a weird clash. As Kay walks around hubs, random characters will call out to her and ask for her help, brokers that Kay has befriended will send her messages about possible jobs, Kay will overhear chatter about a hidden cache of treasure or a secret gambling parlor where bigshots bet huge amounts of money, and Kay can really only make strides in the syndicate relationship tracker by completing side quests for people. And yet, the game's main story heavily implies that Kay does not have time to deal with these people. It feels like the game is offering a lot to do but also telling you that you don't have time to do it."
"Which is a shame, because some of the optional quests offer stronger gameplay experiences than the main story missions. Whereas most of Kay's misadventures in the story are linear, quite a few of the side quests are more open-ended. For example, infiltrating Imperial bases to steal away intel oftentimes offer multiple means of entry and a handful of pathways through the space, letting the stealth mechanics shine a little brighter in actual puzzles that you have to put some thought into solving--the normally repetitive rhythm-based lockpicking minigame temporarily acquired a degree of unnerving pressure when I opted to do it while Nix was distracting a camera and I could hear Storm Troopers I had failed to detect earlier slowly approaching down the hall. I kept having Kay look over her shoulder to see how much my window was closing and wondering why I had opted for this strategy instead of finding a way to reach the power generator that would have shut off security systems like the cameras first. Juggling multiple threats and doing so with a bit of time crunch? Where were these thrills in the main story campaign?"
"To get around these open-worlds, Kay has two main means of transportation: a speeder and her ship, the Trailblazer. I'm a much bigger fan of the former. Though initially unwieldy and difficult to control, Kay's speeder can be upgraded with all manner of parts that make it more nimble and increase its maneuverability, helping Kay speed through Outlaws' handful of open-worlds at entertainingly breakneck speeds. It's designed to make the trek between point A and point B faster and more thrilling, and in both goals, it succeeds."
"I'm colder on the Trailblazer. Aesthetically, it's a remarkable ship--one of my new favorites for the Star Wars universe--and using it to take off from and land on planets is exciting given the accompanying orchestral swell. But in the vacuum of space, the Trailblazer doesn't handle all that well, even after you upgrade it. Dogfights are either frustrating encounters against more nimble starfighters or boring slogs against equally slow cargo ships. And space in Outlaws isn't pretty. Star Wars has had some beautiful space environments but those haven't made their way into Outlaws. In comparison to the lush and verdant jungles of Akiva or the ever-constant and frigid snowfall of Kijimi, Outlaws' space environments lack much in the way of character. There are differences in their layout, but they don't convey much variety in terms of appearance to entice you to explore them."
"Thankfully, like I said before, you can skip most of space. Save for two or three mandatory space battles and missions in the main story, you never have to spend any time among the stars. The Trailblazer is fast enough to outrun anyone who might want to fight you, so getting close enough to a planet to land on it is a cinch. And once you return to space, you can launch the hyperdrive immediately and bypass everything to get straight to your next destination. That said, given how weak the space part of the game is, it was a bad decision to make a space battle the penultimate moment of the story and the major final fight. It robs much of the narrative momentum from Outlaws' final moments with the game's worst gameplay."
"There are so many little moments in Outlaws that I love. However, the unexciting space combat and unrewarding syndicate-relationship tracker don't add anything meaningful to the experience. And neither does Kay, who feels like a protagonist without a meaty narrative arc. The game has some successes when it comes to gunslinging or sneaking--both of which are aided by a superb soundtrack and incredible sound design--but Outlaws does too much of what it does poorly, and too little of what it does well."
"The Mana series has a long and admittedly inconsistent history. There have been ups and downs, but games like Trials of Mana hold a special place in my heart. Decades on from that game's original release and a few years from its remake, the Mana series has another swing at a full-fledged title with Visions of Mana. As the first original mainline game since 2006's Dawn of Mana, does Visions still have the juice for something revelatory? Unfortunately, no. Visions of Mana is not a worthy successor to the series’ best nor worth the time it takes to excavate its few virtues to find that out."
"Like many of the games in the Mana series, Visions takes place in a new world with similar touchstones to previous titles: There is a Mana tree, monster-like elementals governing the natural forces of the world, animal demi-humans, and the like. In Visions' world, however, these forces are constantly waning and require the sacrifice of seven souls every four years to the Mana tree. It is considered an honor to be chosen to die for the Mana tree and the vast majority of characters treat it as such, including the entire main cast, who make a point to never think too hard about it."
"Visions of Mana is about going on a journey with some of the least introspective characters that have ever been written into a story. The cast never thinks long term about their own fates or the men, women, and children that have been sacrificed before them or will be sacrificed after. A traditional story about breaking the cycle and pondering their destinies just never comes, leaving the main cast feel like poorly-written caricatures that are barely involved in their own narrative."
"Every single time I thought that Visions of Mana's story was going to be a layer deeper than what appeared on the surface, I was gut-punched by its aggressive refusal to take the next step. Small moments where characters could be built beyond plasticine marionettes fall flat on their face and are often never referenced again. Visions' story, without spoilers, strikes me as an alternate-universe Bravely Default wherein the game does not attempt to be subversive and instead plays deception as benevolence."
"I held on to a deep hope that, even if Visions of Mana's story were disappointing, the gameplay would be compelling enough to act as a saving grace. This is an easily believable delusion until I realized how absolutely banal the interstitial areas between cities actually are. Rather than be fun romps filled with monsters and fun things to explore, they're dotted with collectible orange globules called Grizzly Syrup that number in the thousands. There's a handful of other activities other than fights, but they all involve finding or collecting items that feel randomly dropped in different locations rather than thoughtfully placed."
"Collecting these items can be as difficult as the game arbitrarily decides to make it. Despite being given a generous air-dash and double-jump to utilize, areas are often capriciously blocked off with invisible walls. Think you see a treasure chest an easy few jumps away? Good luck getting there if an unseen barrier has been placed in the way. I often felt like I was being punished with tedium only for embracing the tools the game provides.."
"This movement frustration is compounded within towns, which have their own share of secrets and theoretical shortcut traversal, but also make the irrational decision to limit your double-jump to a single-jump. I do not understand this choice. No one is being harmed by your character jumping more often, and it makes walking around towns have the sensation of walking through sludge. Couple that with the strange inability to rearrange your party before you venture out to do more battles and exploration often results in just wanting to rush through it as fast as possible."
"Bugs are not especially uncommon, either. The game crashed more than once. Enemies sometimes fell through the ground and required running from battle with no rewards to fix. For that matter, running from battle accidentally in the course of battle and immediately re-entering it with all the enemies at full-health happened occasionally, especially in tighter arenas near the end. On three separate occasions, I came out of battle being unable to walk any longer. I could dash, I could jump, and I made do with just that until I could get to a save point, but walking did not return until I reloaded the game."
"The side quests in the game are unimaginative at best. More often than not, they boil down to beating a certain number of specific enemies or defeating certain enemies somewhere else. They are not retroactive, which might have made them more tolerable. Instead, they have the vibes of homework assigned by the teacher with minutes left in the class. It would be unsurprising if most players just stopped doing them as a whole by the end of the game, because they truly never improve to become anything compelling."
"As action-RPGs, it would be easy to assume the Mana series' most redeeming feature would be its battles, but Visions of Mana manages to somehow prove that wrong. Battles are often quite fun early on, but at some point take a hard right turn into frustrating difficulty. As more and stronger enemies crowd the party, Visions becomes less like intermingling systems of reactions and strategy and more a hanging question of, ""What the hell is knocking me down now?"""
That the game has multiple varied job classes aligned to the different elements--a genuinely fun and interesting mechanic that is compelling to play around with--matters less when you cannot tell which enemy is juggling you repeatedly through an incomprehensible and unparseable cloud of 3D models and effects.
"Boss fights are mostly determined by elemental weaknesses, which are usually easy to guess by realizing you are in a Wood dungeon and thus likely to fight a Wood boss. The problem is that coming in with the wrong element either means a tediously long boss fight or one the party simply won't overcome. On the flip side of that coin, correctly preparing for the right elemental weaknesses brings bosses in the first half of the game to heel entirely too quickly and without much resistance."
"This dynamic had me wishing for something other than a stomp on either side of the equation, which turned out to be a wish suitable for a curling finger on a monkey paw. By the end of the game, bosses hit entirely too hard, with one late-game water boss effectively wiping out the party in two to three hits. In a game where I cannot control exactly what my party members choose to do, such as running headfirst into a swiping claw that quickly slaughters them before I can react, this can get frustrating."
"The most harm done to movement and battle is Visions of Mana's aggressive input delay. Sometimes moves will dial-in fine, and other times a character will be hit by an attack they surely dodged. It does not feel good in battle nor does it make the exploration feel any smoother. The truly maddening part is the inconsistency of it, ensuring that I could never really build this issue into my timing."
"The dungeons in the game last around 10-20 minutes each, usually having a gimmick or mechanic to learn. Early dungeons show you devices and apparatuses that are not only used for puzzles within that space but expand into the greater explorable world. Later, dungeon design becomes bereft of truly interesting ideas and relies on baffling choices to progress. One late-game dungeon features a switch to raise or lower the water level--except you can only raise it, the switch disappears after raising it once, and it is never used or referenced again. Situations like this scream cut content, which makes a short dungeon without anything engaging to sink my teeth into just seem incomplete."
"The overall pacing of Visions is inexplicable. At times the journey has incidental goals that are constantly waylaid, though the entire party takes it beyond stride and into a dreamlike complacency. There is no gradual sense of getting stronger, either through mechanics or story, which makes a wild late-game decision to take on new foes feel utterly baffling. Again, this often feels like an unfinished game, and the pacing is a huge contributor to that perception."
"Aesthetically, I do quite like Visions of Mana. Characters sometimes look like plastic dolls, but the bright colors and fun animations add to their designs. There are scenes that evoke concept art from Secret of Mana or just generally beautiful vistas and verdant fields to look upon in awe. Unfortunately, Visions of Mana looks quite a bit better in stills than in motion, with performance problems clogging not just battles but also cutscenes. Despite prioritizing framerate in the game's menu, battles will often stutter and cutscenes will drop to lower framerates without anything going on to justify it."
"Audio is a similar melange of good and bad. Nothing from the musical selection is an earworm, but it is all good enough to carry the mood. The voice acting, on the other hand, fails to impress even in small doses. Not all the characters or lines are bad, but they feel like a Saturday morning cartoon that rises to the low bar of the story and not much further. The line reads are also not distinctive enough to parse everything being said during battle, nor varied enough to care what is being said during battle before tuning it out."
"There are the rare bits of good in Visions of Mana that it would be unfair to ignore. There are occasional moments of brilliance in the world design and character asides that would surely be indicative of a greater story had they been followed up. Instead, the disappointment compounds when they are not used to their full potential, leaving what should be likable characters and fun discoveries to feel like shredded pieces of paper lining an editing-room floor."
"I really cannot stress how much I had been looking forward to Visions of Mana as someone that counts games like Trials of Mana among my favorite SNES RPGs. But as the game's credits rolled, I breathed a sigh of relief. It was not just that the game was over, but that I no longer had to wonder whether it would turn itself around and make good on the dormant quality it never had the courage to reach up and grasp. Visions of Mana, after the credits, no longer had the capacity to disappoint me further."
"There is a game here for someone willing to lower their standards enough, but trust me when I say there are hundreds of better RPGs for you to spend your time on. You do not need to waste it searching for a few nuggets buried here."
"I've been reviewing Madden's annual installments nearly as long as I've been writing online, and I've been playing the series since the mid-'90s as a little boy. It taught me not just how to play football, but also how to play video games. It has been in my life for as long as I can remember and tied to my career as closely as any game. But lately I've wondered if it may be time for me to take a year off. Madden NFL 25 is--for the third consecutive year, by my count--noticeably improved whenever you're on the field playing football. In this regard, last year's game was the best I'd seen in the series' history, and this year's game outdoes that. If you're going to excel at one thing, it's good to have that be the on-field gameplay. However, describing the game's problems off the field is proving to be a difficult task due to so many of them being repeat offenders year after year."
"It was a few years ago when EA started using the term Fieldsense to describe Madden's multi-year overhaul of on-field mechanics, and though the term is primarily a nice shorthand for the marketing folks to play off of, it coincided with an obvious intent to fix the game on the virtual gridiron itself. Madden 23 was the first game in the Fieldsense era, and here in its third year, the investment in football fundamentals continues to pay off with Madden 25."
"This starts with the game's marquee new feature, Boom Tech. Like the umbrella term of Fieldsense, Boom Tech is the back-of-the-box marketing jargon for what is nevertheless a great new feature. With Boom Tech, the game's collision system has been overhauled considerably. In past years, the Madden team has touted how things like weight and height would matter more, but never before has it really felt so different. This year, the difference is evident and welcome."
"Essentially, Boom Tech breaks the game's collision and tackling animations into several smaller animations. This isn't ragdoll physics; instead, it's an animation-branching system with complex math going on under the proverbial hood of the game at all times, and the result is more unpredictable outcomes, all game, every game. You'll still sometimes see animations you recognize from past years, but they are rarer and, when present anyway, made more nuanced. I've seen a wide variety of outcomes in Madden 25 that a football game ought to have, like better-contested catch animations on deep passes and more bruising, Beastquake-like runs that were previously missing from the series."
"That's all because of Boom Tech. This new system considers weight, momentum, player ratings, and pursuit angles more effectively when a defender runs into the ball carrier. This doesn't guarantee the bigger, faster player wins a tackle attempt, thankfully, as even the best defenders in the game can be caught out of position, for which they are now more realistically penalized."
"This can even mean the ever-reliable Hit Stick is now less of a crutch for an open-field tackler. If you use the Hit Stick too soon, too late, or from a bad angle, you're not going to get one of those fumble-forcing blow-ups like before, and the game's way of now providing on-field feedback for all Hit Stick attempts can tell you exactly why an attempt did or didn't land as intended."
"This sounds like a defense-heavy new toy, but it actually helps both sides of the ball. The player with the leg up on his opponent will win this tug-of-war play after play. It feels great and usually looks great, too. But most importantly, it's realistic. To add an extra detail to this new system, running backs now ""get skinny"" when running through the trenches, too, as they attempt to hit the hole. This makes them a harder target to crash into, which plays directly into that perpetually number-crunching system that is Boom Tech."
"The on-field improvements go beyond that. I love how you can better disguise a defense now by presenting a pre-snap look that differs from the coverage you're actually running. Past Madden games had a simplistic version of this, where you could disguise zone coverage as man coverage or vice versa, but this has expanded to include all types of coverage shells, like Cover 3, 4, 6, et al. For the players who are more invested in Xs and Os, this is incredibly gratifying."
"On offense, you can now adjust the depth of your receivers' routes, too, which similarly expands on a previously simplified mechanic. Madden has long let you audible a route to ""the sticks,"" meaning you'd make your cut at the first down marker, ensuring you pick up the first down should you complete the catch. But now you can essentially draw the route from the line as the QB using the pre-snap menus. For example, this allows a would-be five-yard in-cutting route to instead be run to various other depths, thereby letting you exploit the holes in a defense more easily."
"This provides a great counter for the players grinding out a chess match with a well-disguised defensive guru on the other end. If you can read the defense and see through their disguise, it feels like dodging a jab and landing a haymaker. Even offensive-line adjustments have been given more options, such as shifting half of the line in addition to the previously available whole-line shifts."
"These new features share a common trait: nuance. They each expand on systems that have been in the game for years but are now more satisfyingly designed to reward smart football play-calling and excellent execution. It's why, on the field, this is the best Madden has ever been. Following College Football 25, some have complained that Madden feels sluggish. I find the opposite to be true. Madden 25 feels lifelike, whereas College Football 25 is more arcadey, with players that soar around the field as if games are played at 1.5x speed. I find both are enjoyable, but I want my football to be realistic, and Madden 25 is the most realistic entry in the series, all thanks to the team's hyperfocus on nuanced football."
"But the attention to detail ends as soon as you step out of bounds. My main concern with the game over the last two years is that, as the on-field product got more enjoyable, most of what has surrounded it has felt stuck in neutral, sometimes seeing such minor improvements that they actually felt worse in a sense, as though the team is often catching up to offer features it should've had beforehand anyway."
"This is true once again, and most clearly expressed in Madden 25's suite of game modes. Its offerings are the same as last year's, with most modes getting some attention, but none get enough to compel me to play them beyond Franchise, which I only find enjoyable long-term due to competitive league play."
"Annually, the most obvious target for criticism is Madden Ultimate Team (MUT). This genre-redefining pay-to-win mode combines card-collecting with fantasy sports and once more expertly rolls out a heap of Skinner Boxes for players to obsess over for a few dollars at a time. Can you play MUT without spending a dime? Certainly, though I don't know who is having fun that way given the grueling grind through tedious, sometimes borderline inane challenges, such as completing a pass--a single pass--to earn a few coins in a marketplace where anything of value likely costs several thousand or even hundreds of thousands. Still, I expect that most players who jump into MUT don't spend money, as this is frequently said about seemingly any game offering microtransactions."
"But it's likely anyone playing MUT for a considerable amount of time is spending money, and that's the idea; if I went to Target every day to simply browse the store without the intention to purchase anything, I would eventually spend money anyway. The same economic principles are clearly displayed in MUT and always have been. Even if you don't play the mode at all, you're greeted with a splash screen advertising a new carrot-on-a-stick to chase almost every single day when you boot up the game."
"As I wrote last year, the backlash to pay-to-win systems that other games, such as Star Wars Battlefront 2, had to abandon years ago never really spread to the sports-gaming world. So anything Madden Ultimate Team does that feels good in Madden 25, like its streamlined menus that make sense of the deluge of ongoing events, still lingers inescapably beneath this dark cloud of predatory practices."
"This year, the tutorial I praised a few years ago is made optional, which is a nice touch for the players who spend most of their time in MUT and don't need the refresher, and those same high-end (and high-spend) players can engage in more seasons of content than before, with eight in total this year. Those are nice touches for players already neck-deep in the mode, but it doesn't do anything to entice new players or detractors."
"The most significant change to MUT in Madden 25 is the new ranked head-to-head (H2H) mode, which takes both your success level and your preferred playstyle into account when assigning you a place on the rankings ladder and matching you with opponents. But my years-old issue with this mode as a whole is seen here on full display once more; the game doesn't (adequately, if at all) differentiate between players spending a lot, a little, or nothing at all, which quickly creates an ecosystem where the free players can either drown or pay to stay afloat. That's always felt deliberate, so each year it returns becomes like a gag reflex for where I spend my time within Madden. It's become my annual tradition to drop the mode entirely after playing it for review."
"I admit, there's a comfort in checking the boxes next to each of the game's challenges on what feels like an endless list of things to do, and to see my coin and training points totals increase a little at a time can be as stimulating as payday. The mode is psychologically soothing, by design, but in such an overt way that ultimately turns me away from it."
"That design idea of giving players a bunch of boxes to check is seen in the game's other major modes too, including Superstar, its single-player-centric mode that tells the story of one's created athlete, as well as Superstar Showdown, the ultra-flashy mode that throws out traditional football in favor of neon-lit 3v3 streetball."
"Each of these modes was given a lot more rewards to earn, with many lengthy questlines coloring in Superstar mode and new seasonal leaderboards in Superstar Showdown, but these feel like things the modes should've had last year, when the studio re-launched Superstar and tied it very closely to its flashier sibling mode. I do enjoy how these modes use the same character, as it means you can upgrade your character for the multiplayer-centric mode by first carving out their NFL career beginning with their rookie season, but this also has the downside of making the lackluster Superstar mode feel vital to progression, and since it's not interesting, it can be a grind in itself."
"Though the presentation marginally improves--you're no longer sitting in a lonesome hotel room between games; instead, you're standing around in the locker room--it hasn't done much else to keep players invested like Franchise or even MUT does. On the bright side, EA has resisted letting you buy your way to a higher rating for your Superstar, which is a design decision that annually hurts some other sports games. Still, you can buy XP boosters, including one of the four types that's only purchasable with real money, so it's not a totally clean system either."
"Previously, I've not enjoyed Superstar Showdown much, but given some of the game's limited-time modes and events at launch, I found myself slightly more interested in playing it in Madden 25. The first-to-21 rules of the game's default mode have always felt broken since defenses in this mode are so unreliable and trick plays are so easy to execute; it can feel like playing with randomly assigned teammates is a lost cause, as you're likely to be grouped with players who can't pull their weight in a mode where scoring happens roughly every two or three plays."
"I see the appeal of offering quick in-and-out games for players seeking an alternative to MUT's short-form challenges, but Superstar Showdown only feels engaging with a reliable team of two buddies running the competitive scene with you, severely limiting its reach. In an ideal world, this mode could be expanded further to become a bigger, more engaging landing spot for players. Though its real-money spending options are also numerous, they're all cosmetic-only, so I really don't take issue with them, even as most outfits are so gaudy that I find them embarrassing."
"I think this mode has a future, as it does lean into what players want, with plenty of customization and player-spotlight moments, like an emotes list that gives it a Fortnite-like feel. Today, though, it's not there yet, and the major change in Madden 25 is that it adds more stuff to unlock, which feels cynical. I'll take more rewards, but the mode's gameplay should be inherently fun. Neither Superstar Showdown nor Superstar is fun on its own. Not being able to carry emotes and clothing options forward across Madden years is also a pain point, as many games outside of sports have adopted user-friendly cross-game compatibility like this. This is another area in which sports games get away with offering a worse experience."
"I actually find Superstar KO, a mode that debuted with Madden 20, to be more enjoyable than Showdown, but it received no attention this year. In terms of quick experiences, it's the best of them, though it's a low bar. Effectively a Madden roguelite, you start with a team of a few stars and a limited playbook, and you can earn new elite players with each victory on your way to a perfect 4-0 run in online PvP against players with the same restrictions but different team philosophies. When you lose, you start over with a new team and try again. It feels as though it's present in Madden 25 because it's a low-lift task to include it. Otherwise, it would maybe disappear. I fear that's because the mode has no monetization path, and so it's doomed to get few resources and live in the shadow of MUT and Showdown."
"Maybe I've come to expect little of these other modes, but my annual Madden wishlist consists of really just three things: better on-field gameplay, more immersive presentation, and deeper Franchise mode options. As I mentioned, Madden 25 executes that first one very well, but the other two areas have only a few bright spots."
"On the Franchise end, the biggest change is the new NFL Draft presentation, which kicks off with a cool live-action video package that illustrates how so much of the NFL's appeal is built around this three-day event that consistently changes the trajectory of franchises overnight. In Madden, the game ought to capture that, and though it does in an Xs and Os way--I can draft a player who reshapes my virtual city's skyline, like the late, great Chris Wessesling used to say of Peyton Manning and Indianapolis. However, this year's game tries to mimic the real-life fanfare of actually selecting such a player, and that presentation lands in the same awkward space that Madden has for years whenever it's tried to do narrative content around team-building."
"In this year's new Draft presentation, Commissioner Goodell comes on stage and introduces each of the first 10 picks before shaking hands with the selected players and pausing for a photo op, while the rest of the first round is shown on stage too, and later picks are seen celebrating from home. All of this sounds just like real life, but when you watch it happen in the game, it's off, in an uncanny valley, ""Did aliens make this?"" kind of way. The stage looks drab and empty, the applause from the audience doesn't come close to the raucous energy of the real Draft, and though I can see why voice acting is probably a bad idea, its absence sticks out. It lacks a commentary team breaking down each player's college tape, discussing why they were picked when they were rather than sooner or later, and breaking down how the player may fit on their new pro team."
"Even if we pretend Madden's Draft presentation closely captures the real-life atmosphere, sometimes the information you'll see is faulty. After a pick, you'll see a grade for your draft pick, but too many times I just saw an ""A."" I did a draft where I controlled all 32 teams, and everyone in the first round got an A for a grade--that is until one player finally got a B-. After this point, every draft pick's information actually said this previous player's name and measurables instead of their own. It was as though the grade finally changing somehow broke the entire system. Others online have shown examples of a player's profile picture not matching the person on stage, like a drafted black wideout standing on stage looking like a white offensive lineman."
"The changes to the Draft feel superficial, as though EA wants credit for having created a ""new Draft presentation"" without going far enough to make an interesting Draft presentation. You can't just check a box and say it's done. Too often, Madden's off-field attractions express this trait."
"That's a clear issue in another would-be-great new feature. Madden 25 offers multiple commentary teams for the first time in the series, with the legacy group of Brandon Gaudin and Charles Davis being joined by two other teams that sound fun on paper: Mike Tirico and Greg Olsen, as well as Kate Scott and Brock Huard. Having a variety of voices calling games is a wonderful idea, but the two new teams fall shy of convincing. The worst offender is Mike Tirico. I don't know how, but this game has turned one of the best play-by-play guys working today into a robotic facsimile."
"It's hard to call games when the game isn't really happening in front of you. I'm sympathetic to that truth, but if you're going to have someone of his caliber in the game, he needs to sound at least close to how entertaining he is in reality. Here, Madden can offer only a funhouse mirror of our world. The same is true for Kate Scott, and I think in both examples, it's partly a case of the team not having enough material to use yet. Gaudin and Davis have cataloged audio for years, and they record new material each year. But I also don't recall the inaugural year of that legacy team being as shallow in their football commentary as these new teams are."
"The problem is twofold: There's both stilted delivery and too little material for the commentators to offer any analysis with depth or range. All four of the new voices come off as novices. Even when they attempt to go below the surface and offer meaningful breakdowns with their surely impressive real-life football IQs, they fumble it due to Madden's legacy issue of failing to capture a moment's significance or contradicting itself. Kate Scott closed out my first Super Bowl appearance with the situational awareness of someone texting and driving, offering long stretches of nothingness as the final minutes of the nation's marquee championship game ticked away."
"None of the six commentators are immune to saying the wrong thing, like when Greg Olsen--regarded as today's very best color commentator--noted in the fourth quarter of a game how a quarterback was off to a bad first half. Whether you find such gaffes funny or frustrating, they surely aren't rarities; they're too common and go back years in Madden."
"On the bright side, the Team Builder web tools first introduced in College Football 25 are now in Madden for the first time ever, letting players create custom team logos, jerseys, and stadiums with a level of detail that no Madden player has ever seen. This is a fun tool with lots of depth, but the best feature is how you can elect to never use it directly and still benefit from the many options in the game's download center."
"Bonafide artists can make elaborate, aesthetically cool jerseys and logos, and all you have to do is find one you like in the simple-to-use creation suite. After years of the same tired team logos and USFL-tier uniforms, the Madden team has wisely handed off the art supplies to its community, where they have already found better results."
"It's almost mysterious to me how I'm moved to invest hundreds of hours into this series every year despite it reliably offering the same problems--even if the specifics change, the philosophy remains. Off the field, Madden 25 is mostly checking boxes, and it stings to see my favorite sport not receive a video game companion similar in its grandeur. But the on-field gameplay is paramount and, here, very strong. I don't lose sight of that. This makes Madden 25 enjoyable despite its plethora of locker-room issues. I've played over 30 hours of Madden 25 so far, and I will play hundreds more before next August, at which point I will get the newest Madden and undoubtedly do it all over again. In the end, maybe that's the real Madden Curse."
"In a world where a large enough portion of the population has access to a magical ability of some kind, it's easy to envision how that might affect their career path. The military would make great use of those able to see into the future or others that travel along a different plane of time, making for the ultimate espionage tools. A surgeon who isn't burdened with the risk of losing a patient on the table could be invaluable for some of the most complex and dangerous tasks in a hospital room, while an adept pyromancer could find honest (or incredibly dishonest) work in a variety of fields. Tactical Breach Wizards has a lot of fun toying around in this space, thrusting together a renegade party of regular, but magically capable, heroes in a globe-spanning adventure that is supported by an engrossing turn-based tactics system that rewards smart thinking and creative experimentation."
"The adventure starts with Jen, a plucky witch who gets by as a loose-cannon private investigator. Her latest job gets her involved in a wider conspiracy involving a wizard mafia, a presumed-dead spec ops agent, and a war-torn nation with a valuable resource ripe for exploitation by capitalist countries. It sounds like a checklist for any number of po-faced Tom Clancy novels, but the tongue-in-cheek approach to deconstructing such stories is what makes Tactical Breach Wizards’ lengthy campaign such a joy. It does rely too heavily on occasional exposition dumps to catch you up on why you're moving from one locale to the next, but it's otherwise lifted up by its endearing cast of protagonists and villains alike, with their consistently entertaining banter quickly establishing itself as a highlight."
"Jen might be the de facto leader of your party, but she isn't the only one with a personality you'll likely fall in love with. Zan is a retired military man whose entire career hinged on his ability to see just one second into the future, but was hamstrung by his inability to act on this clairvoyance during critical moments. He's a grizzled but often bumbling war veteran, doling out strategic prowess in one scene while defending his inability to keep a cohesive dossier system during the next. Banks, on the other hand, is a skilled surgeon who happens upon the ability to resurrect people, which makes her a target for some nasty people involved in all manner of illegal activities. She's viciously blunt in comparison to Jen and Zan, but equally playful at times, even if it's just by poking fun at Jen's insecurities or pointing out the sheer ridiculousness of the mission they're on."
"This trio makes the initial cast, but it's expanded on with new members and memorable villains that further flesh out a sharply written script. Tactical Breach Wizards allows you to spend a lot of time with these characters, and it's impressive how much personality is imparted by each of them through text alone. I consistently looked forward to the brief exchanges between party members in between each level, most of which could definitely have taken place anyway but behind the door of a room filled with enemies. It balances the demanding tactical action with flairs of levity at the right moments, peppering in some fourth-wall-breaking moments but never overusing any one element either. Tactical Breach Wizards knows that it's both funny and endearing, and therefore this self-awareness feels earned."
"When your party isn't conversing, they're breaking through doors with loud and flashy hexes. On the surface, Tactical Breach Wizards seems like a familiar take on tile-aligned turn-based gameplay. There's an emphasis on positional placement, a focus on turn efficiency, and a wide array of abilities to use and synergize. Where it begins to differ is in the scope of its skirmishes. Each fight takes place in a relatively small area, never taking more than a couple of minutes and a handful of turns to complete. It's far less about the intense, drawn out fights of XCOM and more akin to the fast-paced bouts in Fights in Tight Spaces or Into the Breach, with Tactical Breach Wizards offering a spin on elements from both in its distinct blend of strategy action."
"For starters, you can rest assured that all of the actions you take during your turn will succeed in the ways you expect them too. Zan, for example, features an ability similar to overwatch in XCOM, but isn't burdened by the possibility that he might miss an enemy that wanders into his crosshairs during their turn. Tactical Breach Wizards also lets you see how enemies are going to react to your actions before you move onto your next turn, giving you insight into exactly how much damage your party will take and how the field might be altered. You're given the chance to rewind all the way back to the start of your turn if you're dissatisfied with how things transpire, but have to live with the consequences once you accept the outcome."
"Tactical Breach Wizards [thrusts] together a renegade party of regular, but magically capable, heroes in a globe-spanning adventure that is supported by an engrossing turn-based tactics system that rewards smart thinking and creative experimentation"
"This less punishing approach encourages a level of experimentation that you might miss from other contemporaries in the genre. It's captivating to try and squeeze out every tactical advantage during each turn, rewinding seemingly small decisions that can ultimately have a big impact. It gives you the freedom to truly understand the ways in which your party's varied abilities synergize without the burden of having to fail towards those epiphanies. That doesn't mean it's without challenge, however. With all these tools to aid you, Tactical Breach Wizards' levels all feel like small, self-contained puzzles with open-ended solutions. Careless and wasteful turns can quickly push you into a corner, whether you ignore the threat of reinforcements flooding in through doors you have been too lazy to seal or capitalizing on your misguided prioritization of different enemy types. But it creates this challenge without resorting to frustrating failure as a means of developing your skills while maintaining the rewarding feeling of a well-executed operation."
"The tactical depth of each encounter is accentuated by the growing repertoire of abilities you'll have access to as you progress through the campaign. Each of your party members has class-specific spells and abilities to play with, with new ones introduced at key moments of the story. Jen is a witch-of-all-trades, with a devastating chained lighting attack that can dispatch multiple enemies at once and an incredibly useful passive that lets you move again after specific actions. Banks, by contrast, excels as a utilitarian, helping revive dead teammates, debuffing enemies with a far-reaching sedative, or just throwing out a glowing skull to do some damage of her own."
"Zan's military background informs the long-ranged attacks from his arcane-powered assault rifle, while his useful decoy can be used to double up on his ability to attack any enemies the rest of your party targets during a turn. These are just a handful of offensive abilities you'll have initially, all of which can be lightly upgraded with perks obtained through experience accrued as you play. Your party composition is determined by the level you're on, so you're consistently required to develop new strategies with new combinations of characters, which prevents each skirmish from getting monotonous."
"Setting enemies alight with magical fire or lining up a bunch for a devastating shield charge, but victory in Tactical Breach Wizards often hinges on how you use the environment to your advantage. Most attacks inflict damage, but also induce some form of knockback, letting you bully enemies around the battlefield. Windows are as deadly as wands here, with enemies dying immediately if you manage to push them, emphasizing the importance of a balance between damage and enemy placement."
"Compound that with the damage you can inflict if you knock enemies into one another or, better still, into explosive hazards that affect others nearby, and you'll quickly start seeing how rewarding it can be to figure out an efficient way to wipe the board before enemies can even take their turn. But it also creates challenges around where to have your party at the end of each turn, as enemies can be just as brutal and knock you off of the map if you're not careful. Some of the game's funniest moments occur when you think you've just conceived a perfect turn, only to witness half your party get knocked to their deaths when playing out the enemy's turn afterwards."
"Varied enemy types and less window-laden stages ensure that you can’t rely on the same strategies all of the time. Larger enemies bring with them some complex buffs, introducing armor to negate damage, gas masks that make them immune to knockback enhancing debuffs, or an outright immunity to being pushed out of a map. Helpful explanations for each type of resistance and immunity can be seen when hovering over an enemy, but the combination of all these effects can sometimes make parsing exactly how to overcome them a little tricky. Some shield-bearing brutes that are introduced mid-way through the campaign are a good example of this. They're the first enemies that you can't really push around, resisting a lot of incoming knockback and traditional damage, while almost making Banks' sedative toothless. They feature so many buffs that stack on one another that it's initially confusing how to start tearing them down, making levels filled with them immediately after their introduction unwelcome difficulty spikes. But they're not frequent enough to completely derail the campaign, and the ability to outright skip levels that are frustrating means you have an option to maintain a pace you're happy with."
"Being able to play on your terms expands to optional content throughout the campaign. Optional bonus objectives feature for each party member throughout each level, while you'll also unlock additional combat puzzles and survival challenges as you progress. Completing any of this optional content doesn't reward you with more experience to spend on upgrade; Instead, you earn points that can be used to purchase cosmetic items for each member of your party. This lets you engage with more tactical content if you choose to rather than making it a component vital to campaign progress, which sidesteps any potential frustration around being too underpowered to move forward with the story."
"You'll find it harder to avoid any frustration, however, if you decide to play Tactical Breach Wizards with a controller. While there are some buttons assigned for actions like rewinding or ending a turn and quickly swapping between team members, reducing the analog stick to a mouse cursor makes selecting abilities and targeting enemies with them a cumbersome chore. It didn't stop me from spending most of my playtime on the Steam Deck, but my time playing with a mouse and keyboard did make it clear that it is the intended way to play, making me long for a more elegant solution not afforded by some tinkering in the controls menu."
"A lack of content isn't an issue here as it might have been with Suspicious Developments first breakout hit, Gunpoint. Tactical Breach Wizards is the largest and most ambitious game the studio has worked on yet, and the extra time it took to get here has certainly not been wasted. It presents familiar tropes of the tactical turn-based genre and removes a lot of the friction that acts as a barrier to entry, without sacrificing the fundamental thrill of formulating a perfect turn and executing it. Coupled with an incredibly personable cast that is brought to life through witty and hilariously written dialogue, and you'll find it hard to resist the urge to breach into battle just one more time after each well-deserved victory."
"Black Myth: Wukong surprised me. Going in, I knew not to expect a souls-like, despite it seemingly sharing many of the genre's hallmarks. The game's Chinese developer, Game Science, has been adamant that it's not a souls-like, preferring to define it more generically as an action-RPG. This is at least partially accurate, as Black Myth: Wukong is definitely not a souls-like. What I wasn't expecting was for it to be essentially a lengthy boss rush. It's not uncommon to go from one boss fight into another and then another, and it's in these elaborate battles where Black Myth: Wukong shines. The moments in between, however, aren't quite as strong, sometimes devolving into aimless tedium. But its satisfying combat and unique variety of boss fights mostly manages to overcome these flaws."
"Black Myth: Wukong's story is based on the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West. Originally published in the 16th century during the Ming dynasty, the epic saga has proven to be incredibly long-lasting and influential since its release, inspiring everything from Ninja Theory's Enslaved: Odyssey to the West to Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball manga. Black Myth: Wukong's take on the enduring tale is set sometime after the original story while still retaining many of its characters. Names like Zhu Bajie, Kang Jinlong, and the Bull Demon King will be instantly recognizable to anyone familiar with Journey to the West, even if certain characters' allegiances sometimes differ from the source material."
"You play as a mute monkey, known as the Destined One, who shares more than a few similarities with the titular Sun Wukong--a legendary simian commonly known as the Monkey King. Sun Wukong is a prominent character in Journey to the West, so your unexpected presence is one of the game's central mysteries. Are you the Monkey King reincarnated, or perhaps one of his clones breaking off on your own quest? The answer isn't the most surprising, but it makes for a thrilling conclusion to the adventure."
"The rest of the game's story didn't quite resonate with me, however. It's clear that Game Science had the freedom to deviate from the source material, but I still felt lost when trying to follow every facet of Black Myth: Wukong's narrative. It helps that each of the game's six chapters revolves around a relatively self-contained tale, dealing with universal human emotions such as love, hate, and greed. Yet it still feels like a story best experienced by those with intimate knowledge of the source material. References and concepts from Journey to the West and other Chinese mythology frequently flew over my head, so I found it difficult to invest in both the broader picture and its more intimate yarns. It's a shame, because finally seeing a Chinese take on a Chinese story as classic as this one is inherently fascinating. A lot of people have only experienced the story through the lens of another country's adaptation, and it's clearly been treated here with a lot of care and attention to detail. There are moments I love--like every encounter you have with a headless monk who serenades you with a Sanxian--and the character designs are universally fantastic, but the story is hard to latch onto if you're unfamiliar with Journey to the West or Chinese folklore and mythology in general."
"Fortunately, one of Black Myth: Wukong's greatest strengths is how it weaves Sun Wukong's wonderous abilities into the framework of its fast-paced combat. The Monkey King is known for wielding Ruyi Jingu Bang, a magical staff that can shrink and extend at will. He can also create clones of himself from a single strand of hair, freeze enemies in place with a point from his finger, and shapeshift into a vast array of different forms. All of these abilities are represented in the game, expertly showcasing the Monkey King's prodigious combat capabilities. By executing combos with the staff, you'll see it elongate to bludgeon enemies with extra ferocity before reverting back to its original size. You can also make use of various spells that consume mana and operate on cooldowns. These include the ability to generate clones of yourself to give enemies more than a single target to focus on, and the use of a magic spell called Immobilize that lets you freeze your foes in place for a few seconds, giving you time to wail on them while they're helplessly trapped or using the opportunity to take a step back and heal."
"Shapeshifting is a significant part of your arsenal, too, as you're able to transform into specific previously defeated enemies and utilize their different movesets and weapons. One of these transformations is called Red Tides, which you acquire early on after defeating the giant wolf Guangzhi. By shapeshifting into this ferocious canine, you're able to wield his flaming glaive to inflict burn damage on your opponents as you twirl around and pull off a variety of combos. What's more, each transformation has its own health bar, essentially providing you with an extra life. Once this health bar is extinguished or you've used up all of your Might by performing various attacks, you transform back into your usual self."
"While shapeshifting and using quick-use spells to freeze enemies and overwhelm them with clones is rewarding, the core of Black Myth: Wukong's combat lies in its unusual combo system. Light attacks are essentially a means to build Focus points, which are spent to unleash different heavy attacks. With enough upgrades, you can eventually bank up to three of these points at a time, and the game's entire combat economy is built on farming Focus and cashing it in as soon as possible to deal significant damage. Light attacks do feel fairly weightless as a result, which is further emphasized by the small amount of damage they chip off each boss's health bar. The game's sense of impact comes from executing a full combo, especially if you're able to transition from a light combo into a heavy finisher. In these moments, your staff begins to glow red-hot as it hurtles through the air and collides with an almighty thump. These attacks deal a ton of damage and regularly stagger enemies in satisfying fashion. Finding openings and using Immobilize to give yourself time to pull off these combos is the basis of Black Myth: Wukong's combat. Once you're able to keep a combo going while mixing in dodges and utilizing your bag of tricks, each boss fight becomes a frenetic and exhilarating dance to the death."
"As an elaborate boss rush, Black Myth: Wukong lives and dies on the quality of its boss battles, and for the most part, they're excellent. Each of the game's six chapters offers a rogue's gallery of thrilling foes to fight. Known as Yaoguai, these mythological beasts range from a giant black bear to a traditional Chinese dragon, a blood-spattered tiger, and many, many more in between. Blocking is not part of your extensive repertoire, and the only form of parrying is limited to a magic spell on a cooldown timer, so you need to excel at dodging to make it through each fight alive. This might sound intimidating if you don't usually play tough action-RPGs, but outside of a couple of boss fights in later chapters, the game isn't particularly challenging. This is coming from a souls-like veteran, so my gauge on what's hard might be slightly skewed, but I defeated a number of the game's bosses on my very first attempt. I still wouldn't say Black Myth: Wukong is approachable, however, as its toughest bosses still pose a considerable threat, and there aren't any difficulty options. The ramp-up to its most challenging moments is just more forgiving."
"Whether you're fighting on a frozen lake surrounded by snow-capped mountains or sloshing through a shallow pool of blood, these battles against the Yaoguai are frequent triumphs. There's a sense of balletic elegance to its best boss fights, mixing martial arts influences with supernatural flair to create these tense and awe-inspiring encounters. You're often challenged to learn attack patterns to nail the timing on dodges and figure out where openings occur so you can get a combo in. But there are also opportunities to be strategic with your abilities, too. Immobilize is ineffective against certain bosses, so you might go for a different spell, or vary your transformations to attack an enemy's elemental weakness. Even if I sometimes found bosses relatively easy, that didn't take away from their thrills, while the toughest among them were often met with a pounding heart and palpable elation when I finally managed to emerge victorious."
"The game's ability to produce this sensation is where Black Myth: Wukong feels most like a souls-like. There are more obvious similarities, such as a checkpoint system that respawns enemies when you rest, and a flask for healing that has a finite number of charges and can be refilled at said checkpoints. Yet aside from this, Game Science wasn't lying when it said it wasn't making a souls-like. This is none more obvious than in the game's level design. For the most part, your path through each chapter is linear, albeit with a couple of forks in the road leading to optional bosses and crafting materials used for brewing potions and forging armor. Occasionally it opens up with more-expansive areas featuring numerous branching paths, but progression is still usually confined to a singular route, so linearity is present even when it doesn't initially appear to be. This isn't inherently bad, but the level design is straightforward and unimaginative--issues that are further compounded by an abundance of jarring invisible walls and a jump that's functionally useless for most of the game. Throw in only a smattering of enemies that don't pose much of a threat, and the sections between boss fights feel disappointingly sparse and languid."
"I also need to mention a moment near the end of the game that stumped me for several hours because the solution is incredibly specific but not at all obvious, especially when there's nothing else like it in the game. This sapped the momentum from the final chapter and had me questioning whether I had encountered a game-breaking bug or was just being ignorant."
"Each environment you explore does at least look fantastic. Whether you're running through a bamboo forest grove punctuated by falling leaves and dense vegetation, entering a spider-infested estate illuminated by the faint glow of moonlight, or planting your feet on the sun-kissed rocks of a craggy canyon, Black Myth: Wukong is frequently beautiful. It ran exceptionally well for me on PC, too, compiling shaders at the outset to prevent the dreaded Unreal Engine 5 stutter."
"Black Myth: Wukong is an uneven game where the highlights often outnumber the lowlights. Its triumphant boss battles and fast-paced combat make up for the stale moments in between, where bland level design and a scarcity of enemies will have you clamoring for the next face-off with a deadly Yaoguai. I appreciate that it's not just another souls-like in what is now a crowded genre, and the choice to go for a boss gauntlet is unexpected and, honestly, quite refreshing. It's disappointing that it falters outside of its cinematic clashes against mighty beasts, but designing this many rousing boss battles while avoiding a sense of fatigue is no mean feat and deserves praise."
"Dustborn is written as though its creators heard complaints like ""Keep politics out of games"" and defiantly went in the opposite direction. It is one of the most overtly political and, more specifically, unapologetically leftist games I've ever played, and that uncommonly brazen setup makes its early hours very interesting, but it falls apart in the second half due to monotonous combat and a final few chapters that undo the stronger first half."
"A near-future dystopian and plainly fascistic America, fractured into territories following a second civil war, plays the sea-to-shining-sea enemy of a group of bleeding hearts on an undercover road trip to fuel a better tomorrow. With a punk-rock cover story aiding its diverse collection of cast-offs from the new America, and gameplay mechanics akin to a Telltale game, Dustborn checks so many of the boxes of a game I'd normally adore. So it was surprising to me, though ultimately not difficult to explain, when the game left me feeling empty and wanting."
"Dustborn's cel-shaded comic-book art direction is captivating right away, and like the broken world it colors in, it immediately caught my eye. I didn't mind, at first, when the opening scene featured the four main heroes being rather annoying. I figured this would be their arc, from awkward pals barely dodging the game's federal force of corrupt cops to defiant leaders toppling tyranny nationwide. I was in for the ride… until I wasn't."
"I can't say there was one exact moment that turned me away from the group. In hindsight, it feels like it was more of a slow burn. The game's earliest of its 15 or so hours are heavy on the world-building and I found much of it fascinating. Dustborn plays with an alternate history in which JFK's wife, Jackie, was killed in Dealey Plaza instead of him. This caused Kennedy to crack down on crime with a new national police force called Justice, which, in a manner reminiscent of the slow-boiled frog, reshaped the country for the worse without it ever being obvious enough to inspire a strong resistance."
"As people grew more complacent toward fascist ideals, things culminated in a 2000s-era broadcast event that spread disinformation like a virus, thus expediting the country's march toward civil war, but also inadvertently creating Anomals (derogatorily called Deviants) who emerged from the event with various new abilities."
"It reads like the setup to a cool book I'd love to read, and it works just as well as an adventure game for a while. I love the way the game depicts its a post-truth society. In an early section, it's explained that disinformation floats in the atmosphere, like a virus on a crowded train, and people can become sick from it if they are exposed. It makes them hostile, mean-spirited, and even drives them to espouse racist, sexist, or other troubling views."
"Here is where it becomes obvious--if the game's earlier way of introducing characters' pronouns didn't do it for you--that this is a game made by leftists, about leftists, and very likely for leftists. It is a game that knows when angry young men tweet about wanting no politics in their games, they usually only mean politics with which they don't agree, and so it feels designed in a way that will knowingly, though not exactly purposely, irritate them with exactly those politics. It doesn't pull punches in that regard, and surely many anger merchants will take the bait once Dustborn hits stores. Funnily, when you hear fuzzy snippets of disinformation in the air, they're always regurgitating right-wing talking points on subjects like climate change denial, xenophobia, or even QAnon and Pizzagate."
"Though Dustborn does eventually attack the opposite end of the sociopolitical spectrum--you can't really be a leftist without fighting other leftists, right?--it is, by and large, a story that villainizes right-wing fascists, but notably only pities their supporters. It's presented as a mirror to our modern-day reality; its view of people who fall for right-wing charlatans is patronizing, but also sincere, as though it's saying we genuinely ought to feel sorry for such people as the conditions that drove them to be misled are, to some extent, not their fault. It's definitely a game that could only exist because of the trajectory of the US as it stands today. Despite its alternate history framework, it pulls from real life quite a bit. Portions of the banter during combat even reference some of the dumbest things former President Trump has said."
"Though those last few paragraphs may well upset some readers across the aisle, I want to emphasize that all of what I just described are the game's coolest parts. I not only have no qualms with the team building a world that reflects its politics, but I also greatly appreciate how thoughtful some of it is. Despite the fun it makes of far- (and even not-so-far-) right thinkers, it sincerely strives for empathy and suggests that it's righteous to help those people come back to reality, rather than leave them to wither away in a cradle of conspiracy theories."
But just because I agree with the game's politics doesn't mean it's a good game.
"A lot of Dustborn's extensive cast of characters focuses primarily on Anomals, including the playable character, Pax, who finds herself equipped with the ability to influence and even hurt people with words. Most of her allies have powers too, like Sai who is extremely strong, or Noam who also has a gift of gab, but theirs leans toward getting someone to calm down, whereas Pax's are all built on negative emotions that stir people into a fervor. Some of these abilities of the group even lean into therapy terms that have gone mainstream, such as triggering and gaslighting, and a late-game ability actually lets you cancel someone, though each of these abilities is recontextualized for more familiar party-based combat mechanics."
"For example, triggering your allies means buffing their damage for a moment, and Pax's ability to sow discord turns the enemies against each other. You can also hoax enemies, which makes them think they're on fire, thereby turning reality's fake news problem into a spell-casting maneuver. This is all pretty clever, but none of it feels good to play."
"Pax's abilities are used in the game's shoddy combat sections and combined with her allies' moves on the fly. This is done with real-time third-person combat, though the game pauses so long as you have your ability wheel open, which you unlock by performing enough melee combos in the meantime, giving it all a slight hybrid style akin to some Dragon Age games. The group regularly battles colorful raiders and anonymous secret police as they trek from the west coast, now known as Pacifica, to Nova Scotia, where their subversive mission is meant to conclude."
"However, combat feels stiff, and the camera routinely does not track Pax's movements well. After a few encounters, this created a Pavlovian response in me in which Pax would equip her baseball bat for a combat section, and I would audibly groan. The idea of language being used as a weapon is cool in itself. It fits perfectly with the game's themes of influence and empathy, but as a third-person action mechanic, it's one of Dustborn's weakest parts. I was grateful when, after an early combat scenario, the game asked me if I would rather have more or less combat going forward. I chose the latter, and even then, there was too much, but it's nice to know it could've been worse."
"That said, despite my wish not to engage in much combat, the game is hardly better when you're not. Animations are lifeless even outside of combat, and this is partly why I found it hard to connect with any of the game's characters. Telltale's The Walking Dead won awards despite its lifeless character models, but that was 12 years ago. Dustborn runs back similarly janky character expressions and movements to the point that it hurts the actors' performances, the game's light puzzle-solving elements, and even just exploring in general. Games like this one that belong in the lineage of those from Telltale and Quantic Dream have, in some cases, moved well beyond such archaic animations by now, but Dustborn is distractingly stuck in the past."
"Dustborn frequently adds new outcasts to the group during their travels, but by the end, I was lacking even one who made me emotionally invested. I spent the time getting to know each of them; I checked in with them by the campfire each night, and I gifted them found items, such as fancy new dice for Eli, who spends his days on the road hosting tabletop RPGs with the group."
"For the most part, they are well-realized and three-dimensional, but the poor animations are buffed by jarring tonal shifts that alter the game from light-hearted ragtag adventure to super-serious political drama, back and forth the whole way. As a result, I never connected with anybody on the tour bus. Because they routinely squirm out of near-death or imprisonment without consequences, it soon became the norm for me to view their obstacles as little more than time killers, which left me uninvested in their mission."
"It's not that I was left wondering who these characters were by the end. In fact, none of them ever stops talking. The game is so thick with banter that there are rarely any moments of silence. They are always chatting with each other, and as Pax, you are almost always able to jump in and join them whenever you want."
"On the one hand, this is impressive, as it feels like you can virtually double the length of the game just by opting into talking to everyone at every opportunity, even if it does conflict with the plot point that the group is always lacking free time. You learn a lot about each of your allies; you shape your relationships with them, all of which determine how the story unfolds and where each character ends up--some may not even survive. So there is at least the illusion of stakes--though a partial replay didn't suggest major differences in the saga--and there is obvious depth. And yet I just wanted them all to be quiet for a second. Just one second."
"They talk so much that other voice lines often cut off their voice lines in an unnatural way because they'll be blabbering on and on, and you'll trigger a cutscene or interact with something that halts them mid-sentence so they can say something else instead. It takes a strength of the game and, through subpar implementation, makes it janky. I haven't heard a cacophony of breathless progressives this grating since I saw Death Cab for Cutie last summer--and I live in Portland."
"Dustborn also presented a few technical issues, including a game-breaking bug that caused me to lose all my progress on PC. This bug has since been patched, I'm told, but it seemed not to apply retroactively to my saved data, so while you apparently won't deal with it post-launch, I had to start the game over after several hours. When I did, the game crashed on me four times in my playthrough, though thankfully the auto-saving feature meant this was just a minor annoyance each time."
"The group's cover story for traversing the hostile state is that they're a touring punk rock band, and the game even has you perform their shows several times using a Rock Band-style mini-game that is decent and enjoyable, except for its underexplained scoring system. But their music is so sonically tame and decidedly not punk rock beyond the ethos expressed in its lyrics. One of the reasons I was drawn to this game was a sincere desire to hear the original punk rock songs promised within, but there really aren't any to be found. Instead, they're a pop act, maybe pop-punk at best, and that missing aggression in their sound was a disappointment. Some of the game's other lackluster parts are disappointing, but this one is confusing, first and foremost."
"The band's incendiary lyrics should likely get them locked up in such a hostile land, but the only time this ever came up in my playthrough was when a Justice cop passively warned me that folks in America don't take kindly to such songs--even though the song was overtly about progressives outliving their political enemies and inheriting a world they can then make better. It seemed like I should get more than a slap on the wrist since the story made a point of telling me how unforgiving the cops are."
"That's an excellent example of how it all unravels, too, as it illustrates the chasm between the setup and the execution. The history that Dustborn introduces is engrossing at first. I read every document I could, down to the small signs taped to a fridge, or the packaging on the jerky; I interacted with every poster or book to see what other signs of its alternate history I could find. And in its comic-book art style, it all looked as interesting as its setting first sounded."
"But over the course of the game, and particularly in its final few chapters, a story already soaked in metaphors--some better than others--positively drowns in them. It eventually goes so far off the rails that its thoughtful early chapters feel written by entirely different human beings. I'd be more forgiving of this narratively chaotic final act if I were attached to the characters--I like Lost Season 6, after all. In Lost's case, the events could be silly, but at least I'd have my people. In Dustborn, however, I never really had them to begin with, so I was left with nothing to latch onto. Dustborn's moral compass points to true north, but before long, both its story and gameplay go south."
""
"As the name implies, Farewell North is a game about saying goodbye--to a place, to people, and to the lifestyle that those things represent. Though the narrative adventure is short, it packs a lot of characterization and resonance into that time, with only occasional stumbling blocks to blunt the impact of the experience."
"You play as Chesley, or Ches for short: a sweet-natured border collie who had once worked as a sheepdog on a farm in the Scottish highlands. Your human companion, a young woman named Cailey, ventured off her family farm and into the city but was summoned back when her rural mother became ill. Cailey helped with the farm for a while, relying on Ches' herding skills, and then when her mother passed away, they moved back to the city together, where Ches became a homebound pet rather than a working dog. This game captures what seems to be Cailey's first time coming back to the area since then."
"On one level, this is a game about loss, and how it manifests in different ways. Cailey lost her mother, and as you explore the Scottish highlands with her, you get bittersweet reflections about her farm life and how it felt to slowly lose her mother to a terminal illness. Though it's less pointed, you also get the sense that Ches lost her home when she became a city dog, so this return to the highlands is a reunion of sorts."
"That sense of coming back home is what makes a lot of the moment-to-moment gameplay feel light and joyful, even when it's touching on very serious subject matter. Ches is obviously thrilled to be back in the wild with the freedom to explore wide open fields, herd sheep, and generally commune with nature. Likewise, Cailey is reflecting on both moments of sadness and joy with her mother, the land, and Ches."
"The core of the experience is solving a series of environmental puzzles, though these are as light and airy as the environment itself. The puzzles aren't especially mentally taxing, which usually gives the whole affair a relaxing feel that lets you focus squarely on the narrative."
"I say usually, though, because while it does have a calm, relaxed feel when everything is working properly, I did occasionally run into a situation where it wasn't entirely clear what to do. Often puzzles come down to crossing under a downed tree or other similar piece of nature that will change the environment in some subtle way, and if you happen to miss one of these, you're liable to be very confused about the path forward. At one point I was stuck for quite a while, and when I finally did discover the way, I wasn't entirely sure what I had been doing wrong before. I just stumbled my way into it, blissfully unaware."
"This is partly due to the visuals, which are mostly presented with a muted gray color palette that becomes colorful in key moments and as a response to certain gameplay segments--for example, the area just around a herd of sheep will be colorful, which makes them stand out from the background. This is important for illustrating the central concept: that Ches' time with Cailey is restoring color and joy to their world, but it can also sometimes make the environment hard to read."
"For that reason, the game is at its best when the puzzles take a back seat and the game instead relishes in the views of nature, like an early moment when the music crescendos as Ches runs through a field that has had its color restored. It also excels at abstracting the environment in key moments to show you the world through a dog's eyes, like the streaks of traffic lights making an impassable wall, or a sea of intimidating, faceless strangers who appear to be trying to snatch you, but who are actually Cailey's friends and community helping to look for you."
"Farewell North is a grounded, slice-of-life game given some fantastical elements through Ches' unique perspective. As it reaches its emotional climax, it becomes a stirring meditation on the role pets play in their humans' lives as comfort and support, and likewise, the role that humans play in the lives of their pets as providers and protectors. While its waypointing can be occasionally frustrating, it's a sweet, emotionally resonant experience that will stick with you, and maybe prompt a little extra cuddle time with your own pets."
"SteamWorld Heist 2 marks the seventh game in the SteamWorld franchise, which has built itself more as an anthology than a series. The name is a playground for different ideas, loosely connected around a cartoon-robot aesthetic, rather than a connected universe of familiar gameplay structures and stories. Heist 2 marks only the second direct sequel, after SteamWorld Dig 2. Since Dig was SteamWorld's breakthrough, it seems significant that the second true sequel is going to the more-modest cult-hit SteamWorld Heist. But the proof is in the pudding, as SteamWorld Heist 2 is a massive leap over the first game, expanding on virtually all of its systems without overcomplicating them or compromising its charm."
"Like the first game, SteamWorld Heist 2 defies easy categorization, as it really only plays like itself. You and your band of Steambots go on missions to tightly enclosed indoor spaces, and take part in turn-based tactical combat. While there is cover and abilities with cooldowns like you might find in a typical XCOM-like, the 2D perspective shifts more than just your point-of-view--in comparison to its genre contemporaries, Heist 2 plays extremely differently. Rather than flanking around enemies, there's a huge emphasis on verticality, as well as lining up trick-shots using laser sight-like aimlines to bounce your projectiles off the walls or objects to hit an enemy ducking behind cover. And like the first game, you can pick up bags of optional loot, typically including one especially well-hidden or well-guarded piece of epic loot, and then head for the evacuation point to end the mission. How long you stay to grab every last piece of loot is often pressed by an escalating alarm system, creating a nice tension between risk and reward."
"Where SteamWorld Heist 2 builds on the first game's structure is through a variety of new systems, each of which feels full-fledged in itself and complements the existing loop. Primary among these is a new job-class system, which is defined by your weaponry. Any Steambot can equip any job by simply switching their primary weapon during the mission loadout, and the requisite experience points they earn in that mission will go toward the equipped job. Each job has five levels to unlock, with a sequence of powerful abilities becoming available throughout."
"The real fun is in mixing and matching the abilities you've already mastered to unlock new combinations that can feel gloriously overpowered. The Reaper, for example, is usually restricted to SMGs, which have a shorter aimline than most other jobs. But you can master its Harvest skill, which lets you continue to take shots at enemies as long as you're delivering fatal damage, and then equip it onto a stronger class like Boomer or a long-range class like Sniper, allowing one unit to potentially clear a whole room. Similarly, you can take the Flanker, a shotgun-wielding class that's especially mobile, and apply its abilities to a Sniper to give them access to better vantage points. Or you can take a Sniper's detailed aim-sight and give it to a Boomer to see where their rockets' splash damage will hit. Toying with these combinations is a real treat, and vital for mastering some of the late-game challenges."
"One point I especially loved about the job system is how it handles excess experience points. Typically in a game with job classes, mastering a job presents you with an annoying choice: Stick with your mastered job to give you the best shot at completing difficult story missions but gain no experience, or switch to another job to gain experience but become much weaker as a result. This softly pushes players toward going back and grinding with other jobs, which isn't terribly fun. In SteamWorld Heist 2, however, you can keep your mastered jobs equipped, and excess experience points earned go into that character's reserve pool. The pool is then automatically applied to the next job you equip and complete a mission with. So you can keep your elite-level Sniper for critical story missions, and bank the experience you earn along the way, then switch to another job for an older and easier mission to apply all that banked experience and catch up with a different job. This is a brilliant solution to a common design problem, and it sands off a major rough edge of most job-class systems."
"Your capacity to equip extra abilities is determined by your Cogs--slots for non-primary abilities. You'll have a certain amount of Cogs by default, but this also plays into other systems. Certain equipment will give you more Cog slots if you want to cook up some wicked combinations, or they can be used for other utilities like enhanced armor, sidearms or grenades, or healing packs. And even within a single job, the weapon variety is expansive--one SMG might offer more burst-fire but won't ricochet off walls, while another may offer armor-piercing or healing properties. It's incredibly flexible and lets you build out your team to suit your playstyle."
"Aside from upgrading your individual crew members with jobs and equipment, you'll also earn special currency to spend in your home base, which will go toward advancing your party in other ways. You can choose to spend it on individual, unique abilities for each of your party members, or job-class upgrades that will be applied to any bot equipped with that job. My MVP was Daisy, whose ultimate unique ability reduces the Cog cost of all abilities, making her the ideal tester for different job combinations."
"You can also use that currency to enhance the submarine, your floating home base that is also your roving battle station. As opposed to the first game, Heist 2 all takes place on a single planet almost entirely covered in water. Your submarine will transport you to missions, but it will also take part in exciting real-time naval battles against enemy ships, or can be used to explore and find hidden nooks with their own special caches of equipment. As you unlock more submarine equipment slots, it becomes almost as customizable as your characters, letting you determine which types of weapons to use, whether you want to prioritize speed or strength, and so on. The submarine combat feels like a minigame but it's nicely fleshed out and a good change of pace from the regular mission combat."
"The water-logged planet is also a major element in the story. The water supply--the lifeblood of steam-powered robots--is getting corrupted and leading to a condition known as the Rust. The dominant factions are the high-powered and shiny Dieselbot Navy, who pride themselves on not needing steam power, and the Rattlers, a grim robot cult whose members have started systematically replacing their metal parts with bones, which don't rust."
"The main protagonist is Captain Quincy Leeway, a one-armed Steambot living in the shadow of his mother, a legendary captain herself. Most of the story revolves around Leeway learning how to forge his own path under the weight of those expectations, but he's also not an active participant in missions. Instead, he's the voice in the earpiece of your other mission-bound bots, giving instructions and providing context for the missions. You do play as Leeway when exploring your ship or docking with a store, or solving the occasional simple exploration puzzle. And while Leeway starts out simply looking for a score, it's not long before the story turns toward uncovering the secret of the Rust corruption, as well as getting caught between the warring factions. This is ultimately a tale about a ragtag group of ne'er-do-well pirates who become a family, and while it can be a little dialogue-heavy in rare moments, it's in service of a sweet story."
"As you progress through the world and uncover the map--with an ever-so-satisfying cloud-clearing animation as you do--you'll find certain areas ability-locked for your submarine. That gating comes down to yet another system: your local reputation. To earn a specific new piece of submarine equipment, you'll often need to accrue a certain level of reputation by completing missions in the area. Usually this means either perfecting a few missions, or merely completing several of them. Your reputation can be cashed in for special ""bounty"" rewards when you rest at an inn. Resting is the only way to regain access to party members you've already used, so maximizing your reputation and bounty rewards means having a deep bench of robots to complete multiple missions between each stay at the inn. It's just one more way Heist 2 smartly pushes you toward maximizing your efficiency with another tactical wrinkle."
"What's most impressive about all of these disparate systems is how well they synergize with each other, and how they remain easily understandable and not overwhelming. Like a well-crafted Steambot, each part and gear of SteamWorld Heist 2 attaches just-so to another, with every piece of the device contributing and feeding into the function of two or three other parts. The result is a game that plays with clockwork precision from start to finish."
"I didn't expect I'd review two games about pied-pipering friendly and fantastical animals around a beautiful world in the span of just a few weeks, but following the recent release of Flock, a somewhat similar game has arrived. Creatures of Ava, however, is a much bigger and more ambitious game, and usually reaches the surprisingly high benchmarks it sets for itself. From a pair of relatively unknown studios, this open-world creature-saving game is touching, gorgeous, and ultimately serves as one of the best family games of the year."
"Creatures of Ava stars Vic, a researcher who arrives on the planet Ava to help complete an ark project that intends to rescue the world's animals from the withering, a planet-wide infection that is slowly corrupting life itself. Even before I knew what kind of game Creatures of Ava would be, I was taken aback by how pretty it is. It's one of the best-looking games I've played in 2024, with a vibrant color palette of bright oranges, pinks, blues, and more that is immediately striking."
"Additionally, the game's way of carrying players through a story that involves four distinct open-world sections, each with its own biomes and aesthetics, means new surprises and sights are regularly debuting. I was genuinely excited to conclude each chapter just so I could see what remarkable vistas the game would unveil next."
"It doesn't just look pretty, either; it feels alive. Though Vic can sprint endlessly, I sometimes slowed myself down just to soak in my environment--to listen to animal calls from the lush magenta jungle or stand atop massive yellow flowers in the swamplands and watch the local fauna from a distance."
"I couldn't do that forever, of course. The mission is to extract a great number of animals from the planet and onto a BioArk meant to give the planet's various species a second chance at life, a sort of futuristic take on the biblical story of Noah's Ark. For Vic, this becomes an interesting and even welcomingly mature internal conflict. Is it enough to simply save a few of each animal? Is it possible to instead save the entire planet? As Vic grapples with her company's intentions and her own limitations, the local human-like denizens interact with her in various ways, too."
"Initially, the game's premise seemed like a minefield for problematic tropes, like a savior arriving in a land of ""natives"" and fixing everything for them, or an animal-friendly game that routinely depicts exploitative treatment of the animals. I was really impressed to see how the story rejects these. Not only does it seem to be aware of the pitfalls and mindfully avoid them, but it does so while adding some interesting wrinkles to both the story and gameplay."
"This isn't the climate change allegory it first appears to be, and even as other surprises are found along the way, I'd have felt sure that would at least be true--but by the end, it's not. Even the typical ""cozy"" game cards weren't played, other than the ability to pet any animal in the game. Creatures of Ava is a lovely family game, but it doesn't shy from hitting you in the gut pretty hard in its final act, and it does it in ways you won't see coming."
"Its large cast of characters is well-written, though sometimes poorly performed. I could often hear the splicing together of dialogue which was distracting, albeit not terribly annoying, and some line reads don't carry their intended weight. Fortunately, the game actually benefits from most dialogue being text only. The writing of many unique and more human-like denizens of Ava comes off stronger for it, as the game's meditative, comical, or argumentative group leaders, and others, aren't sullied by inconsistent voicework."
"But more than the mesmerizing visuals or the heartfelt story, it's the moment-to-moment gameplay that surprised me most of all. Creatures of Ava repurposes years of action-adventure mechanics to create a nonviolent world that is still full of action and compelling progression. Its combat system is built entirely around evasion and defense. As Vic seeks to cleanse the animals with a magical staff she receives from her new allies, the corruption has them on the offensive, but Vic's entire moveset consists of dodging, leaping, rolling, and otherwise stifling the animals' attacks, but never paying back any damage in kind."
"The firehose-like staff takes time to purify each animal, so each combat encounter becomes a round of crowd control, as you must avoid damage until the animals are freed of the infection. A clever touch to this system is how that hose-like stream of cleansing power allows for other animals to get caught up in it too, should they cross the stream, thereby creating a chain of what you could arguably call playful exorcisms."
"The camera does often get in the way in these encounters, as it doesn't automatically keep Vic centered when animals run off the screen to flank her. This makes it feel like I need a third hand--or at least an extra thumb--to steer the camera while I also move, fire the cleansing magic, and use her other abilities."
"Different animals have unique attack patterns and different defenses, and Vic's abilities grow over time to maintain stride with the always-evolving list of ""enemies,"" including tools that help her slow, lift, freeze, and more quickly cleanse the creatures. None of these things are done in a way that harms the animals, evidenced by the fact that they don't even have traditional HP bars; instead, their infection levels are quantified and drained as you succeed. Flipping traditional third-person combat on its head in these ways feels both inventive and vital to the story's themes, and I'm really grateful the team found a way to eschew long-held video game traditions of pummeling the badness out of an enemy."
"It's also important to take photos of the animals, both with and without infection, as it reveals details about each species, including their abilities. This process results in a Pokedex-like device brimming with information and your custom photos, which makes it fun trying to line up the perfect shot even if a creature happens to be charging at your kneecaps. Once cleansed, Vic can play melodies that train the animals to follow her, at which point she can actually have them solve environmental platforming puzzles as needed, and eventually lead them to pick-up zones to cast them onto the ark."
"None of the puzzles are especially difficult, but there's an enjoyable learning curve in observing an obstacle and figuring out which animals you may need to charm in order to advance further. However, I did occasionally struggle with navigating the world, as its map can be a bit confusing, and some areas can only be accessed by specific routes that are liable to be forgotten or missed."
"That said, this wandering was not entirely in vain, as the four open-world hubs are littered with sights to see around every corner, be they lore-filled collectibles, upgrades to Vic's health, stamina, and inventory space, or more ways to level her up and unlock more skill points to spend on abilities. I beat the 11-hour game in two sittings because, despite its imperfections, I found it hard to put down."
"Many of the side missions are especially memorable to me, as they allowed me to get to know even more characters, like an elder of a village who could no longer make the trek to a beloved waterfall. A simple photo mission thus became a much more memorable act of kindness, as they were so grateful when I returned with a picture of the locale for them to appreciate. There are many missions like this one, and I spent the time to see a lot of them through. Creatures of Ava is gifted with a heart as vibrant as its world."
"Thanks to its blend of platforming, puzzles, and ""combat,"" all set in a colorful world, Creatures of Ava reminds me of a kind of action-adventure game that is seldom made anymore. It's both nostalgic for yesteryear while also creatively reinventing traditional elements of the genre. It routinely defies tropes in every corner of its world, yet still feels like the sort of game that is approachable, familiar, and easy to love. With a story that goes harder than one might expect and gameplay that routinely throws new tools and challenges in front of you, Creatures of Ava is surely one of the year's coolest surprises."
"Your first task in Thank Goodness You're Here! is to answer the question, ""A'tha from Tarn?"" Depending on your response, the game's menus and subtitles will either display in English or the local dialect, changing words like ""Options"" to ""Faff"" and ""Continue game"" to ""Keep gu'in."" If this rather odd choice hasn't already given it away, Thank Goodness You're Here! is possibly the most quintessentially British game ever made--specifically, northern England and the town of Barnsworth, a fictional town right near the very real town of Barnsley. Developed by Coal Supper--a two-person team who grew up in the post-industrial town--this absurdist comedy ""slapformer"" is a genuinely hilarious romp. It won't appeal to everyone and can be finished over a few cups of tea, but there aren't many games that have managed to plaster such a huge smile on my face."
"The game's mouthful of a title is uttered by a few of the game's characters, including a young fan of Barnsworth's local football club. ""Thank Goodness You're Here!"" he exclaims as you leap through an open window and into a kitchen adorned with red and white scarves and framed pictures of the team's players. Sitting at the dining table with a cup of dark tea, he pleads with you to procure him some milk. He'd go himself, but he's terribly ""milk shy."" So off you pop to the local farm, where Bessie the cow requires a bag of chips--wrapped in newspaper, of course--to perk her up before she can produce any milky goodness. The local chip shop, Marge's Chippo, is the place to go, but after recently fixing the deep fat fryer, the queue is far too long and you don't have time to wait. This leads to another trek across town, with more whimsical hijinks abound before you eventually get your hands on that precious, precious milk."
"This is the general gist of Thank Goodness You're Here! If it sounds like you're simply running around performing a series of fetch quests, it's actually much more involved than that. You play as a tiny traveling salesman who's arrived in town for a meeting with the mayor. Instead of sitting in the waiting room until they're ready to see you, you decide to venture out into town where the locals are all too eager to give you a series of increasingly odd jobs. As you explore the streets of Barnsworth and help out its wacky denizens, your antics leave an indelible mark on the place, opening up new areas to probe as you're given more and more zany tasks to complete."
"There's some light 2D platforming involved, and this is mixed with larger 3D environments that you're free to wander around as you literally slap everything and everyone in sight. The term ""slapformer"" quickly makes sense, then, since slapping and jumping are the only ways to interact with the world. Hitting someone upside the head usually gets them talking, but there are also postboxes, pigeons, doors, vegetables, and traffic bollards to slap as well. Sometimes you'll simply destroy whatever you're slapping. Other times you might reveal a gag or the path forward. It's a bit like Untitled Goose Game in this regard, albeit more structured with specific quests to undertake as you cause chaos on Barnsworth's streets."
"Getting from one area to another does feel a little clumsy at first. Progression is always achieved by moving to the right, but this also puts you in a circle so that you wrap back around the town. Essentially, you have to move forward in order to also go backward. This initially feels unintuitive but eventually begins to click into place through repetition (like jumping down a well to reach the fish shop), especially once you start noticing how each location changes on repeat visits. I do, however, wish there were a couple more areas just to flesh out the town even further and increase the game's longevity a tad."
"It's hard to argue with the game's structure when it's as funny as it is, though. Absurdism and surrealism are common avenues for its humor, whether you're swimming through beer while a drunken bottle talks about downing a morning pint before getting out of bed, or going shopping at the local Price Shaggers supermarket with a talking hand that's stretched out for miles because its owner is bedbound. It's ridiculous, but it works because all of it starts somewhere grounded: a small Yorkshire town."
"A lot of British comedy transcends borders. A lot of it doesn't. Thank Goodness You're Here! exists somewhere in the middle. If you're not from the UK or have never lived in the UK, some of its jokes are going to go over your head as it delves into common facts of British life and even Yorkshire-specific folklore. Yet for every specialized gag, there are dozens more that will tickle your funny bone regardless of your background. It's a game filled with outlandish euphemisms, drawing from Wallace and Gromit's cheeky approach to humor with a decidedly more adult spin. It can be gross, but also unabashedly silly and dark. And it's all brought to life with a vibrant art style that resembles a mashup between Adventure Time and classic British comics like The Beano, The Dandy, and Viz. The game's character designs are often just as comical as its writing, not to mention all of the visual gags."
"The entire voice cast is also excellent, breathing further life into each of Barnsworth's residents. There's Herbert, a hapless gardener voiced by the ever-brilliant Matt Berry. ""I've been sucking this pipe for days,"" he shares with you when you walk in on him fiddling with a hose. ""Almost done, then I can get home to my puzzles,"" says a litter picker in a hi-viz jacket. ""I love puzzles,"" he adds. There's also Jasper the Scottish handyman, who's always losing his tools and claiming they're stolen. You're witness to an awkward romance between Florence, the meat-counter girl at Big Ron's Big Pie shop, and the delivery boy from Mother Megg's Buttery Goods. After seeing the pub owner struggling to think of what to put on the ""today's special"" sign, you come back later and see that he eventually settled on ""Drinks."" From the voice acting to the writing to the characters and environmental designs, Coal Supper has crafted an incredible sense of place that persists even when things go off the rails."
"It might be on the short side at around two hours in length, but Thank Goodness You're Here! barely wastes a single second of its absurd adventure. Not only is it consistently funny, but it also made me feel incredibly warm and nostalgic for the era of cartoons and comics I grew up with, even if it feels quite singular in its approach to both surreal and intimately familiar humor. It's not a game everyone will vibe with--such is the divisiveness of comedy in particular. But those who click with it are unlikely to find another game this year anywhere near as joyous."
"To my surprise, the answer was yes. At first, I was simply expecting a one-to-one Madden reskin. Yet as soon as the first game started, the presentation and pageantry on display were quick indications that this was a brand-new ball game. EA Sports College Football 25 perfectly encapsulates what attending a college football game is like. Vibrant and viciously loud crowds, hundreds of university-specific walkouts and traditions, and uniquely designed stadiums make each school's ambiance give off its own air of distinct excitement."
"That production isn't just for pre-rendered cutscenes, as EA Sports College Football 25 also looks impressive during its moment-to-moment gameplay. You can just about see every pore and bead of sweat running down players' skin as they bounce off each other, and movement and AI reactivity are much more realistic than what we've seen in Madden thus far."
"One of the first examples of EA Sports College Football 25's improved movement can be seen in the running game. Halfbacks touch guards' backs and run through holes instead of butt-fumbling into them, and spin moves have weight and fluidity. On the other side of the ball, tackling has more dimensions than just hitting or missing. A heavy defensive end's hit is far more gruesome than a speedy cornerback's, just like it would be in reality."
"The passing game also features sharp improvements, as the more intelligent AI--combined with the freeform placement pacing introduced in Madden 24--makes for some tight-window receptions. Corners can no longer be user-controlled right before the play and jump 20 feet in the air for an easy interception. Every pick in EA Sports College Football 25 is earned due to good coverage, playcalling, and ability."
"While I don’t play it myself, it is also worth mentioning that My Ultimate Team (MUT) EA Sports College Football 25 has been added in. It is identical to what is in Madden, still placing plenty of focus and emphasis on microtransactions and pay-to-win gameplay. Anyone that enjoys it, regardless of this, isn’t going to be deterred from trying it out with college players instead of NFL stars."
"Yet while EA Sports College Football 25 improves upon many of the foundations built via Madden, it also bears some of its burdens--especially the single-player career mode, Road to Glory. Everything about the mode is underwhelming, and it is easy to tell this is the case straight from the moment you begin.Instead of proving yourself as a high-school prospect as you did in NCAA Football 14, you simply choose your position and star rating at the outset. The higher the caliber of your player, the more chance you have at starting earlier. If you pick a lower-star recruit, you have to earn your spot. But while working your way up from the bottom sounds like it has the potential for a cool storyline, the process merely consists of playing the same minigames repeatedly in hopes that you eventually get playing time. Additionally, there isn't any story or commentary mentioning your rise to the top if you do so, meaning there is no point in picking anything less than a five-star player."
"Once you get into the starting lineup, it is frustrating how little agency your character has, even if he's the star quarterback. Sure, it is understandable that the coach wouldn't give the entire playbook to his freshman QB, but not being able to audible out of a play and having a limited amount of Play Change points per game to make it so that there are three play options instead of just one is far too restrictive. As an optional means of increasing immersion, this would be fine, but the inability to turn off these restrictions is a considerable letdown."
"Speaking of immersion, EA Sports College Football 25's attempt to replicate academia is also a miss. When not playing in a game, your character is allocated limited energy points toward certain activities. Depending on your choice, you'll get XP increases or modifiers that can be used in the game. It doesn't take long to figure out how to game the system, as you just need to max out Academics for the first half of the season and completely ignore the Brand section, which has no impact on the game. Once you do, the rest of the season can be spent building XP and leadership to unlock upgrade points and in-game buffs."
"Scenarios sometimes occur via the form of a text message, but their boosts are rarely worth it, and their attempts at stories are half-hearted at best. The only one that did elicit a chuckle is a situation where you can be blocked by a female student for over-texting her about going to a party. Outside of that, the off-the-field experience is unremarkable. Worse than that, if you skip managing the activity, your player will be impacted negatively on the field via injuries or debuffs to stats. Thankfully, Dynasty mode is the polar opposite of Road to Glory."
"Where Road to Glory feels like a barebones attempt at career mode, dynasty is a tapestry of planning and executing. Recruiting is considerably in-depth, as it takes into account specific player wants and needs and requires you to shape your team around them and invest time to land players. The amount of time and scholarships you have at your disposal are limited, so spending them scouting players you might not have a chance to sign is a roll of the dice."
"In order to improve those chances, you can overcome dealbreakers, including school prestige and playstyle. It's a surprisingly intricate system, as you need to balance multiple players' needs during the recruiting process while also doing your best to win games during the season. The choice to pick an established coach or create your own is also surprisingly accommodating, considering how restrictive choice is in Road to Glory."
"Choosing an established coach comes with the benefit of abilities and upgrades, like improved recruiting, that give you a head start. Comparatively, proving yourself and starting from the ground up allows you to customize your attributes and playstyle to fit how you like to play the game. This means you can allocate the upgrade points you receive from leveling up to any category in the skill tree instead of using whatever locked-in skill a pre-established coach has."
"For those who enjoy a challenge, Dynasty mode also features consequences for your actions. Fail to live up to the expectations set by the contract, which is determined by school legacy, and you might just find yourself looking for a new job after three years. This realism makes for some pretty fun scenarios."
"Just picture getting sacked by LSU and then bringing up an underdog school like Kennesaw State to the college playoffs and beating your old school to win the national title. It's this kind of vicarious scenario in EA Sports College Football 25 that can make a lot of the other frustrating aspects worth it. Hopefully, EA can continue to build upon this solid foundation while also fleshing out the aspects of the series to help separate it further from Madden and create a unique experience."
"Sylvio: Black Waters might be the most under-the-radar third entry in a series I or perhaps even GameSpot has ever reviewed. The ghost-hunting series has been a deeply hidden gem in my mind for many years now, and Black Waters continues its winning streak. It keeps intact the best parts of the previous games while adding some new wrinkles and reviving some mechanics it had previously left behind. Not all of that works in its favor, but its strengths are so notable that it remains one of the year's best horror games."
"In Sylvio: Black Waters, you play Juliette, a ghost hunter. In the previous two games, she spent her time in creepy fairgrounds and haunted houses, recording staticky electronic voice phenomena (EVP), and in the sequel, even capturing ghostly images, too. Black Waters makes that the focus once again, although this time, it does so in a setting so peculiar and unpredictable that it gives the game an element of science fiction."
"At first, I thought the strange, Mars-like dreamworld, where everything is rust-colored and decorated as though some unseen landscaper is practicing a stream-of-consciousness exercise, would be difficult to get into. It was almost too alien, unlike the more earthly and relatable locales I explored in the earlier games. In those cases, it felt like a place I could in which I could find myself. Black Waters' setting doesn't have that trait, but it doesn't take long for it to reveal its own alluring creepiness."
"Its shifting and labyrinthine space means you'll sometimes start in one of the game's five open-ish hubs with parts of the world upside down or perpendicular to where you find yourself, but as you crawl through crevices, climb dilapidated brick walls, and scale ladders, the world will shift, as though you're crawling on a sphere moving in the opposite direction of you. Despite how unfamiliar and dizzying the world is, I also never really got lost. It has a good way of subtly directing you through a level; you don't feel in control of its world, but neither are you stuck in place. It perpetually pulls you through."
"The goal is to explore the world, discovering fragments of voices and videos belonging to the people who have seemingly come and gone before you arrived. Like in past Sylvio games, this audio design is Black Waters' greatest asset. Stroboskop is a tiny team, with past games being developed by one person, and this one has only a few more credited. But the team has always been true masters of unsettling audio design. Few games have ever creeped me out as this series does, and even in this third go-round with the central mechanic of capturing ghostly voices on tape, I still genuinely got shivers and goosebumps several times in my five-hour playthrough."
"Growing up, I always loved browsing ghost-hunting websites. I loved to suspend my disbelief and get spooked by the EVPs I'd find online. Sylvio rekindles this appreciation within me, as its manufactured EVPs sound so much like the ""real"" thing that they are indistinguishable from one another. As you find recordings, you need to play them backward or forward, as well as on one of three speeds. Backmasked messaging is unnerving even when it's just on a Beatles album, so when the context is missing or dead people are talking about witches, devils, and a foreboding lake located somewhere in the strange world you explore, the effect is much greater."
"So many of the voices you discover are poetic in nature, like a dream half-remembered and restitched together by emotions more than words. It furthers the game's greatly disconcerting atmosphere by giving you vague allusions to danger or violence, but not enough of an explanation to make sense of it all."
"Without that cognitive closure, a mind tends to fill in the blanks, like a monster you can hear off-screen but never see. Playing it alone at night and with headphones on, Black Waters had me peering over my shoulder more than once. I stress this because I've played horror games all my life, so very few games have this effect on me anymore, but three of them now come from this one series."
"Juliette doesn't know why she's there or what the place even is, which creates a compelling central mystery the previous games didn't have, and it's made better by her having a companion on the radio, Lee, who introduces himself as the lone survivor of the hazy world. Their back-and-forth makes for more front-and-center story than ever before in a Sylvio game, and their equally but dissimilarly moody performances make it all work. Juliette's hushed tones have always been a pitch-perfect companion to Sylvio's vibe, and Lee's performance always skews just a little bit off, like he's an unreliable narrator in Juliette's story, but you can't quite place why you feel that way."
"All of this is aided by another remarkable soundtrack, just like the other games. Stroboskop's Niklas Swanberg has a background in composing music and it shows as the series' audio is consistently excellent. In Black Waters, the music can be hard to describe as it's quite varied--sometimes oddly folksy, like the music found coming from a radio at an abandoned campsite. Other times, it's breathy and churchy."
"The game also debuts a new feature in which you can find pieces of original songs and put them back together, which adds more interesting background to the story. The eclectic music only really shares one attribute regardless of which track is playing: It's disquieting--an earworm you wish you could forget because it's gutturally upsetting. In a horror game, that's like magic."
"The original Sylvio involved some combat elements, which I didn't enjoy. I preferred the sequel's way of focusing almost exclusively on the EVP mechanics; it made me feel like Ethan Hawke's character in Sinister, dissecting these cursed tapes and discovering things I wish I didn't. Sylvio: Black Waters revives and reimagines the series' combat mechanics, though I think they once again aren't a strength of the series."
"As you move through levels, you'll find several air-powered guns that you load with some kind of liquid and marbles. These guns are seemingly meant to offer different strategies for different situations, like a rifle that would perhaps shoot farther than the pistol- or shotgun-like options, but in practice, I was able to use any of them for any occasion, which made the variety pointless. The range was irrelevant. The purpose of the gunplay being there at all is to dispel the ghosts that sometimes try to do you harm as you progress. The problem, however, is that they aren't very difficult to defeat. Amber-like humanoid statues are scattered throughout each level, and sometimes they come to life and chase you as wispy spirits. Once ambulant, the longer they exist near you, the more damage you take, but you can counter this by destroying the statues with marbles before they awaken."
"In theory, there's a solid mechanic here in which you must decide to expend a marble to preemptively destroy the ghost, or take your chances and see if it doesn't awaken, but because ammo is abundant so long as you're diligently searching each level, this calculus is rarely relevant. Only in the last level did I have to make such wagers. For nearly all of the game, I simply destroyed the statues from a safe distance before they stirred, which I found is the ideal way to play for a secondary reason: Some statues hid more audio to dissect, which allowed me to piece together about a dozen additional stories beyond the five mandatory tales one unravels by beating the game."
"The third Sylvio game is a worthy successor to the two supremely haunting games that came before it. Though it reverts to featuring some of the first game's lesser parts, it also carries over and improves on the best aspects of both its predecessors. Sylvio: Black Waters reaffirms what was already obvious to me: Stroboskop's audio design is on a level few other horror games can compete with, and with some future honing in on and improving the mechanics surrounding that centerpiece, the series still has room to grow. Even in this state, however, Sylvio: Black Waters will stick with you longer after the static dissipates."
"At first glance, Kunitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess feels like the spinning plates metaphor made manifest. Each stage requires you to purge supernatural rot, rescue villagers, build traps, and fight off waves of hideous demons, all with the goal of aiding a divine maiden in her quest to rid Mt. Kafuku of a plague. The gameplay mechanics required to achieve all of those tasks, however, bundle together to create one of the more distinct experiences in video games this year."
"On a moment-to-moment basis, Kunitsu-Gami tests your fighting skills, as well as your wits and your ability to think on your feet, lest the maiden in your care succumb to the rot. There are elements where the fun of its sword-swinging, demon-slaying action is supplanted by menial tasks, but those hiccups aren't enough to derail the whole experience. Kunitsu-Gami is a refreshing new addition to Capcom's stable of IP and a solid execution of an engaging gameplay loop."
"This new adventure puts you in control of Soh, a samurai warrior who is sworn to protect Yoshiro, the aforementioned divine maiden. Their home, Mt. Kafuku, has been invaded by the Seethe, a demonic force of otherworldly entities who have spread a hideous plague of ""defilement"" throughout the land. Soh must lead Yoshiro through each town and village on the mountain, protecting her at all costs as she purges the defilement once and for all."
"Right away, you can see the deep Japanese cultural influence on this game. The ceremonial garb, traditional dancing, and musical choices are immediately absorbing, and it feels like we're playing a piece of Japanese folklore. Notably, the game achieves this despite having very little dialogue; it is simply the actions of the characters on the screen that pull you in, and that's very impressive."
"That said, the narrative arc also takes a backseat to the central gameplay loop, which renders the story as a whole slightly less effective. Kunitsu-Gami cares much more about making you work for each victory than it does about telling you a story before and after you achieve it. While this is a bummer, the potency of that gameplay loop--and the just-one-more-level feeling it creates--neutralizes the disappointment quickly."
"Each new chapter starts with Yoshiro and Soh standing on one end of the stage, with a black path in the ground signaling the way to a Torii gate covered in rot, which, when cleansed, will restore the entire area. The day/night cycle provides two distinct-yet-intertwined gameplay modes, each providing its own challenges."
"During the day, you'll scout the area while rescuing villagers ensnared in rot and purging smaller, contained areas of defilement. Cleaning up these areas earns you crystals--through purges and through cutting down small plants lining the pathways--and they can be spent both to carve the path through the rot for Yoshiro to move along and to assign jobs to the villagers you rescue. Once all of the defilement is purged from an area, a shrine opens and you'll earn a reward."
"The simple act of starting a stage and going through the setup phase creates many stress-inducing decisions you'll need to think about before the first attack. Crystals are a finite resource, but are they better spent on the villagers who act as defense, or on carving the path for Yoshiro? Is there a happy medium where Yoshiro can walk to a point that's better defended than her starting point? The strategy element is fascinating, stressful, and exhilarating all at once, and that tension only builds as day turns into night."
"Once night falls, the strategy elements immediately give way to hack-and-slash action as Soh and company take on the Seethe hordes. Their numbers increase as more waves come out during the night, and not having a solid strategy for dealing with those numbers could leave you overwhelmed. I was impressed with how many different types of Seethe are in the game; it feels like every stage comes with some new horrible enemy to face, each with its own abilities and weaknesses. The creeps also drop crystals for use in the next daytime cycle, so despite how scary these monsters are, you're encouraged to fight every one of them. Thankfully, slashing through these demons is a lot of fun, as the waves of enemies from moon up to moon down provide intense and constant action."
"The Seethe can be dumb sometimes, however, which breaks the flow of the action every time it occurs. For example, one type of Seethe is meant to keep a distance and attack with projectiles. In keeping that distance, however, they corner themselves and stay in one place. Since waves of Seethe don't normally begin until the previous wave is defeated, you can leave that lone demon alone for as long as you like, which gives you an unintended breather that feels like cheating in a way."
"What's most impressive about Kunitsu-Gami's core loop is how the nighttime fights immediately bear the fruits of your labor in the daytime segments--or shine a spotlight on something you missed. You might have put up that protective barrier to fortify the path in front of Yoshiro, but the left or right flank might be wide open. When multiple portals of Seethe open in later stages, what you thought might account for both paths might only impact one. Should you make a wrong decision, most of the time you can adjust formations on the fly or figure out a different plan in the next cycle, but sometimes one mistake can ruin an entire run, and you'll have to adjust after the game-over screen. That instant payoff, positive or negative, is always a thrill and immediately gets you thinking about what's next."
"While what's described above is the main format of each stage, some of them take a completely different approach, as if Capcom realized that keeping with the same day/night cycle over and over again might turn some players off. One stage puts Soh, Yoshiro, and all of the villagers on a boat crossing a river, which is inundated with Seethe from all sides. Another sees a unique type of demon possessing Yoshiro immediately, which renders Soh unable to fight, so all you can do is assign the villagers jobs and direct them as a small floating spirit. Forrest Gump's old adage about chocolate somehow, incredibly, applies here too; you never know what you're going to get when you start up a new stage."
"Most stages also have an adjacent boss battle, which unlocks once the main challenge is completed. These are the best parts of Kunitsu-Gami, as each boss provides some of the best battles in games this year. Some are just bigger and badder versions of Seethe we've seen before, but others are completely unique monsters with a suite of attacks that requires deft dodging, well-timed parries, and measured attacks. Defeating them earns Soh and company a mask, which manifests in new jobs for the villagers to assume--a fair reward for the intense battles you're put through that feeds back into adding new wrinkles to the core gameplay loop."
"Outside of the core loop, there's also a base-building mechanic, but this is far more mundane than anything else in the game. Soh can revisit areas already cleansed by Yoshiro and instruct the villagers to rebuild areas destroyed by the Seethe. These tasks are completed while you advance through the main story chapters, which means you have to return to earn the reward given by these repairs."
"On the surface, this sounds like an optional side quest, but there's a catch: The main reward for completing these base building tasks is musubi, a material that acts as the main upgrade resource for both Soh and the villagers. This turns a boring-but-skippable side quest into a boring-but-super-important one, which forces you to backtrack after every completed stage, and in turn bogs down the entire experience. Also, the requirement to get these repairs done is completing a certain number of missions--which includes replaying older missions, but repeating the same mission over and over again just adds to the boredom."
"Additionally, while the idea of rebuilding what was destroyed isn't a problem, its implementation is; in order to initiate these repairs, you must run to specific points in the area, which drags the pace down even further. All of this could have been managed in menus, which would allow you to get back in the action more quickly than we do now."
"The different ways Kunitsu-Gami pulls your mind during a day/night cycle in real time is intense, but the thrill of it all is hard to describe. Capcom's deft merging of two seemingly disparate genres, with tower defense and even some RPG elements thrown in for flavor, has created an experience that's noteworthy for its successes more than its failures. Sure, there are a few missteps--namely in the incredibly tedious base-building segments--but the action and strategy provided in the core experience overcomes that tedium to create a game worthy of your time."
"Capcom has been firing on all cylinders lately in regards to its tenured franchises, and now that success has manifested in an interesting new IP. Kunitsu-Gami begins on strong footing, and we may be witnessing the next great Capcom franchise carving a path right in front of our eyes."
"The First Descendant is a bad video game that's occasionally fun. These fleeting moments of joy speak to the potential of the game's bedrock, where snappy combat ekes out glimpses of delight amidst a torrent of disappointment and frustration. Everything surrounding the game's fast-paced shooting is painfully dull, tedious, and egregiously predatory. The First Descendant is a free-to-play, third-person looter shooter that feels like it was designed to please shareholders rather than the people playing it. It's derivative and soulless, bereft of new ideas outside of the myriad ways it attempts to extract money from its player base. It's a foul example of a game designed around monetization, even in a market saturated with freemium looter shooters."
"It doesn't start on good footing, either. The First Descendant's story is convoluted and sterile, but the basic premise places you as one of the titular Descendants--a group of humans with unique abilities passed down to them from their fallen ancestors. You're tasked with fighting for the survival of humanity against an invading alien threat known as the Vulgus, who traveled to the colonized planet of Ingris in search of an infinite energy source."
"These interdimensional invaders come in all shapes and sizes, with very little in common regarding their visual design. Some look like gray-skinned humans; others are grotesque creatures with large glowing claws. There are sleek and smooth-edged robots, but also clunky ones, too. Some are made to resemble humanoid lizards, while others are floating orbs that shoot lightning. There's no cohesion or unifying theme to the Vulgus. Even their names range from Greg to something more alien, like Alzaroke."
"This might seem like a minor gripe in the grand scheme of things. If the enemy looks cool, then who cares? But it's indicative of the game's poor approach to storytelling and worldbuilding. Maybe a lot of these disparate enemy types are slaves or were sworn to fealty in exchange for their lives. That would heighten the Vulgus threat and explain the dearth of cohesion, but I never encountered anything like this. The story is more concerned with incessantly regurgitating the same plot points and burying you beneath a mountain of laborious jargon, often saying things without saying anything at all. There's almost no character development or any shred of personality in sight. It doesn't even end, cutting off at what feels like the halfway point so the story can presumably continue in forthcoming updates. But who wants to see more? The best way to experience The First Descendant's narrative is by skipping it entirely."
"Combat is at least snappy, and the standard assortment of assault rifles, snipers, and shotguns generally feel impactful unless you're fighting one of the game's bullet sponge enemies. Seeing numbers pop up as you fill an enemy with lead is as inherently satisfying as it usually is, and each character has access to a grappling hook that lets you zip around the environment and pull yourself toward enemies. The First Descendant is a fairly mobile shooter and incentivizes constant motion, either to avoid incoming fire, venture into a crowd of enemies to unleash AOE attacks or zip to the outskirts of a battle to take out a pesky sniper. The loot you earn from all of this shooting is distinctly bland, however. You're constantly submerged in so much nebulous loot that most of it feels meaningless. Every assault rifle feels like every other assault rifle, so you're simply picking whichever gun has the highest DPS and disregarding the rest."
"Fortunately, The Descendants and their abilities are varied enough that each one feels unique. There are 14 playable characters in all, five of which have more powerful Ultimate variants. At the beginning of the game, you're given a choice between one of three starting Descendants. Then you can unlock or purchase the others later, if you so choose."
"Each Descendant has four active skills that operate on a cooldown, along with one passive skill. I started with Viessa, who uses ice attacks to deal damage and freeze enemies in place. She's fine but can't compare to Bunny, the first new character you unlock. Bunny epitomizes the game's mobility with her lightning-quick movement and devastating electric attacks. The more she runs, the more electrical energy she accumulates, which you can then unleash in powerful shockwaves. When you're in full flight, you're essentially a roving AOE attack, able to weave in and out of enemy groups while zapping them to death. It's fun, particularly when combined with an SMG or shotgun, although I wish there was some semblance of synergy between each of the Descendants."
"You can play the whole game solo, but it's incredibly easy to join other players in co-op, which feels essential in later missions. Aside from making life easier, however, there's little difference between playing by yourself or with others. Ajax can deploy a domed shield for everyone to use as cover, but I didn't encounter another example of a Descendant's skills working in tandem with others or even benefiting them. Take Valby, for instance. She can liquefy herself, which leaves a trail of water in her wake that damages any enemies standing within it. It would've been cool if Bunny could then electrify this water and inflict even more damage, adding a much-needed element of teamwork while also altering the dynamics of combat. But that's not the case."
"Any of The First Descendant's other positives are quickly undermined by its stale mission design and arduous grind. The game's basic structure sees you visit various locations where you're tasked with completing a few short missions in an open area before moving on to a linear, dungeon-esque Operation. These missions consist of the same few objectives over and over again, typically revolving around killing things and standing in circles to hack or defend something or other. It gets tedious fairly quickly and is then extrapolated across a full 35-hour game and beyond (because the endgame also has you repeating these same missions)."
"It's incredibly boring and monotonous, and is made worse by the fact that most of these objectives often stifle your class abilities. Bunny needs to be allowed to run free, not be confined to a circle where you're forced to stand still and shoot waves of incoming enemies. The enemies themselves don't make this interesting, either, as they are intent on jogging towards you in a straight line. They don't roll or take cover; they're mindless drones lining up to be shot. There are a few exceptions to the rule, but even the enemy type that teleports just looks like it's lagging across the map."
"Operations fare slightly better, but even these longer missions still frequently include the same dreary objectives. Worse still, the bosses waiting for you at the end of each one share an identical pattern of events. After depleting their initial health bar, each boss becomes invulnerable, being shielded by floating balls. You need to destroy these balls--sometimes in a specific order, sometimes all at once--to take down their shield and resume dealing damage to their health bar. This is fine the first time you do it, but it repeats on roughly 95% of the bosses you face. Add in the fact that these bosses often share the same attack patterns or simply just stand there and shoot you, and these battles are another terribly dull and exhausting element of The First Descendant's design."
"For as bad as all of this is, it's made significantly worse by the game's approach to progression. In order to unlock new Descendants and unique ultimate weapons, you need to gather a bunch of materials to construct each one. Partway through the game, I was given a side quest to unlock a new character called Freyna. This involved playing three missions for the chance to acquire three different materials. I spent almost an hour replaying the same two-minute mission on repeat, just hoping to receive an item with a 20% drop rate. After that, I did the same with an Operation, spending over an hour repeating the same mission waiting for the material I needed to drop."
"My reward for trudging through the same banal missions was a new character that I then needed to wait 16 hours before I was allowed to use. Not only is this mind-numbingly dull, but this vapid approach also encourages toxicity. I encountered a few occasions where a player remained idle throughout an entire Operation, presumably sick of having to play the same mission ad nauseam. All of this seems to be by design, as the workaround is to relent at the sheer tedium of it all and spend real money to expedite the process and gain immediate access."
"The First Descendant's storefront is inundated with an overwhelming amount of things you can purchase with real money. There's a tab dedicated solely to ""Convenience,"" offering boosts to speed up the deliberate inconvenience of the game's grind. You can pay to decrease the timer that's placed on everything you unlock; pay to unlock more mod slots, which directly correlates to how powerful your character is; pay to unlock Descendants themselves, who vary in price but always cost just over the amount of in-game currency you're allowed to buy, forcing you to pay more. If you want an Ultimate version of a Descendant--which comes with increased stats, additional mod slots, more powerful attacks and skills, and a few skins--it will set you back around $104."
"You can unlock Ultimate Descendants by playing the game, but then you're looking at sub-3% drop rates on all of the materials you need. It's obscene, especially when the game also has a premium battle pass and no shame about exploiting practices like restricting single-use armor dye to one piece of clothing. And while it may not be a competitive shooter, those who bypass the game's grind still create a significant imbalance during Operations. Powerful characters, particularly if they're speed-based, can blaze through these linear levels to the point where other players won't even see an enemy. The entire game is built to make you want to acquiesce and part with your hard-earned cash. A $10 Descendant starts to look mightily appealing when the only other option is mindlessly soul-crushing, and that's the whole point."
"The First Descendant has moments of fun, but its action is constantly debilitated by tiresome mission design and a grind entirely informed by its venomous monetization. It's designed to frustrate and steer players toward an extensive storefront that lets you circumvent some of its monotony, only to be met with even more. There are no redeeming features to its intentionally infuriating free-to-play model; it feels like a game designed in a boardroom, where every single aspect of its design is secondary to the pursuit of making more money. It's a sad state of affairs, and I wouldn't recommend The First Descendant to anyone."
"In Path of the Teal Lotus, you play as the titular Bō, a celestial blossom charged with fulfilling an ancient prophecy and defeating a terrifyingly large monstrosity after falling from the heavens. Armed with a bō staff, Bō must traverse and fight their way through picturesque locales, meeting characters and fighting monsters inspired by Japanese folklore. It's an incredible narrative tee-up, but one that comes after hours of coy character dialogue and not much in the way of direction beyond ""go get this ability to get to the next area."" Path of the Teal Lotus' story takes a long time to get going, leaving the first half of the game feeling directionless. And once a story does start falling into place, the game is already heading toward its conclusion, culminating in an overall narrative tempo that initially feels far too slow before becoming rushed and difficult to follow."
"And I wanted to get lost in this game's world. Path of the Teal Lotus is a beautiful game, featuring a colorful, hand-drawn 2.5D style that incorporates vibrant greens, electric blues, somber purples, and shining reds. Character and enemy designs are varied and pop against the backdrop, with details helping to highlight NPCs you want to talk to and enemy weak points you want to bash. The world relies on the tried-and-true method of associating a specific color with each location and then relying on said color to depict the same location on the map, reinforcing each distinct locale and the unique challenges you'll encounter there, whether it's the icy blue of a snow-covered mountaintop or soft pink of a sakura-filled forest."
"Composer Moisés Camargo brings these locales to life with an incredible musical score that incorporates traditional Japanese string instruments. The overall sound design is great, too, and pairs with distinct visual indicators to help discern what's happening to Bō during especially hectic scenes--a sharp clang and small kickback burst letting you know that Bō is attacking impenetrable armor, for example, or a satisfying boing and brief release of white particle effects indicating that Bō successfully bounced off an enemy's head."
"But for as beautiful as the world is to look at and listen to, it's far too tricky to get around. Path of the Teal Lotus attempts to straddle the line of a traditional action game's linear progression and a metroidvania's looping exploration, and it doesn't quite succeed at either. Each of its areas is mostly self-contained, the spokes of a wheel connecting back to one hub. In an entirely linear game, a structure like this wouldn't be a problem as you'd handle each spoke one by one. But Path of the Teal Lotus leans hard into those metrodivania trappings, with the main quest and multiple optional side quests requiring you to backtrack to other areas. Though a fast-travel system helps, you still have to travel to specific points in order to use this system and the rarity of such points means you spend a lot of time just trying to reach them. Backtracking gets harder the further into the game you get as the spokes of the map get longer and longer, distancing themselves and going against the necessary interconnectivity to alleviate the frustration of aimless exploration."
"Worse, Path of the Teal Lotus' map isn't very good. Multiple times, I'd look at it and wonder where I was supposed to go next, with the formatting suggesting I had explored every area. Eventually, I'd stumble upon an NPC or hallway I had missed--Path of the Teal Lotus marks a room having been fully explored even if you've only just walked past it, but it doesn't put markers for additional discoveries in that room unless you actually fully explore said room. The result is a map that sometimes says you've fully uncovered a corner of the map when, in fact, you may have actually not gone into one of the areas where a pathway leads to where you next need to go. An objective tracker graciously alleviates much of the guesswork, at least pointing you in the right direction so you know which locale to explore, but this only lessens the unrewarding guesswork of exploration, rather than outright removing it."
"On the flipside, combat in Path of the Teal Lotus is great. Bō swings their staff with acrobatic grace, knocking back enemies with a satisfying thwack. While in the air, the staff can be used to bounce off enemies, adding a degree of aerial finesse to Bō's dance-like movements. It's simple to pick up, but there's a remarkably high skill ceiling, especially in the latter half of the game when the movesets of the tough-as-nails yokai boss fights build on Bō's additional abilities--like a dash and spider ball-like wall roll--to ramp up the tension of each confrontation. Bō's rhythmic movements aid in mastering the patterns that underlie each combat encounter; there's a dance to learn here, and each counter you master ensures you lead the performance. A few of the boss fights frustrated me enough to put the game down for a while, but my qualms were never with the mechanics, just my own inability to maneuver through the enemy's attacks in the way the game was clearly indicating."
"I do have qualms with the platforming, however. Bō's floaty movements may add to the dance-like sensation of the combat, but they transform the platforming segments in the game into terrible slogs. One moment in particular--in which you have to navigate two back-to-back frustratingly long platforming gauntlets in an icy cave--almost convinced me to put the game down for good. The structure of the game simply does not allow for Bō to perform tight jumps and precise movements, leading to a handful of missed jumps that can be rage-inducing during sections of the game where one-too-many mistakes can send you back to the last spawn point at the start of the series of spikes, moving platforms, crushing walls, and Bō-tracking bats. Thankfully, many of the platforming challenges in the game are optional, hiding secret shortcuts or collectibles. But the handful of times that the mandatory ones pop up stalls the momentum of progression to an irritating halt."
"Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus is a gorgeous game, featuring an incredible art style and sound design that strengthen an already colorful world that I want to explore. But getting around in the game is regularly a chore, and Bō's floaty, dance-like movements too often lead to frustrating deaths during platforming gauntlets. The game at least shines through its combat, and the story is exciting once it does actually get going--but there's just too much in the way to fully enjoy what the game does well."
"Following its release on Nintendo Switch this past April, Demon Slayer: Sweep the Board has been released on additional platforms. Unfortunately, however, it seems my wait for Sweep the Board to come to PC was not worth it. After nearly 10 hours of playing, I still have a hard time discerning just who exactly this game was made for. From clunky controls to boring minigames, Sweep the Board feels like a party game that lacks any sense of ""party."""
"Demon Slayer: Sweep the Board adapts several arcs of the manga and anime into Mario Party-esque layouts. From Asakusa and Mount Fujikasane in Board 1 to the Swordsmith Village in Board 5, each map is chock-full of references and nods to moments from the show, which was a treat for me as a fan. For instance, there are multiple paths in Mt. Natagumo that take you to Tsuzumi Mansion, which has a mysterious drum that causes characters inside the building to move to random locations. The Swordsmith Village, meanwhile, has hot springs, mechanical training dolls, and Haganezuka chasing you around. Those familiar with the source material will no doubt get a kick out of the references, albeit a brief one."
"Players traverse the board by rolling dice and moving across spaces, with branching paths that lead to other areas. Likewise, maps have their own modes of transportation in keeping with their respective themes, such as boats that take you from Asakusa to Northwest Town, rickshaws in Yoshiwara Entertainment District, and the Mugen Train going around the tracks. There are plenty of NPCs to encounter when you land on certain spaces, too, including Tamayo’s cat, Goto (one of the Kakushi), Tengen Uzui’s honeys, and more, leading to a fair amount of replayability."
"As far as characters go, Sweep the Board lets you choose from 12 heroes, including the main trio of Tanjiro, Zenitsu, and Inosuke. They're joined by Hashira like Mitsuri, Gyomei, Rengoku, Sanemi, and more. Curiously enough, Nezuko isn’t playable, but she does appear as a support character who helps the player in last place, usually by adding an extra dice roll or handing a free item to them. I actually like this concept since, although Nezuko is absolutely vicious in her Awakened demon form, she’s still a child that everyone is protective of. It makes more sense to have her assist than play an active role, much like in the series."
"Characters in the game are beautifully rendered and animated; the original cast also did the Japanese and English voiceovers, meaning I found myself immersed right down to the most minute details. Zenitsu’s giddy reactions, Inosuke’s brashness, Shinobu’s cheerful disposition, and Giyu’s nonchalant remarks all effectively evoke the source material. My only gripe here is that characters don’t have unique perks or abilities, which would’ve been apt for a board game where you control powerful fighters. Instead, everyone just has the usual dice rolls and Slayer Dice that grant samey bonuses."
"Your main goal in Demon Slayer: Sweep the Board is to amass Rank Points at the end of a match, which can be as short as five turns or as time-consuming as 30 turns. At the start of each day, players participate in a variety of minigames. There were a select few that I really enjoyed, such as Team Memory Matching which, as the term implies, is all about flipping portraits until you find a match, and Zenko’s Zealous Performance, which is akin to a musical rhythm game. My favorite, by far, is Don’t Miss a Beat! where I had to run through Tsuzumi Mansion’s twisting hallways, all while jumping over pits and razor-sharp projectiles thrown by Kyogai the Drum Demon."
"However, several minigames were overly simple, hilariously easy, or downright boring. For example, Last One Jumping is a skipping rope minigame where I just had to press a button at the right time, while Demon Sleigh-er had me move side to side to pass through speed bursts while avoiding obstacles. Some activities even occurred twice during the same match, which made the whole endeavor repetitive to a fault."
"Regrettably, the controls can be unresponsive or janky at times, too. Demon Slayer: Sweep the Board offers solo play, online play, and local split-screen for up to four people (with any remaining slots controlled by the CPU). For local split-screen, I decided to use a keyboard while my wife used a Logitech F310 gamepad. Playing on a gamepad was significantly more comfortable than using a keyboard, since the latter led to cumbersome moments especially in minigames that required the use of the WASD keys to trace drawings or follow a diagonal direction. Worse, I noticed button prompts would change in the middle of a game--rolling a die and ending a dialogue usually meant pressing the “E” key, but there were instances when the “Q” key had to be pressed instead. I couldn’t tell if this was a bug due to a keyboard and gamepad setup for local play."
"The board switches to its night phase once a player has reached the destination spot, which is also when Greater Demons spawn. These powerful enemies keep with the theme of each board, with Yahaba, Susamaru, and the Hand Demon emerging in Asakusa/Mt. Fujikasane, Enmu and Akaza in the Mugen Train, Gyutaro and Daki in the Entertainment District, and so on. I was impressed by the inclusion of these opponents, which were presented as special boss encounters complete with short cutscenes from the anime. Even Muzan shows up several turns in, extending the night phase, so to speak, and increasing the number of threats."
"My only complaint here is that boss battles against Greater Demons are still your run-of-the-mill button mash or quick-time event affairs with little variety or challenge. There are a couple of notable exceptions, such as the Daki encounter, though this is mostly because button prompts appeared in different positions onscreen, making the battle more confusing than exciting. It was disappointing to see boss battles themselves turn into dull and uninspired activities."
"The most glaring shortcoming of Demon Slayer: Sweep the Board, however, is that it’s hardly something that can be considered a competitive board game or party game. When you think of other titles and franchises in these genres, such as Mario Party Superstars, The Jackbox Party Pack, Talisman, Catan, or even Monopoly, you’re either looking for chaotic romps, memorable and fun minigames, or ways to sabotage and stymie your opponent’s progress. The mere notion of someone leading the pack, and the knowledge that you can snatch their hard-earned rewards or their lead from under their nose, creates tense, exasperating, and oftentime amusing moments."
"Sadly, these moments are few and far between in Demon Slayer: Sweep the Board. During the course of my review, I kept checking for perks that would allow me to steal goodies from other players or claim their Hashira ally as my own, but it looks like these mechanics don’t exist. Outside of a couple of consumable items--one that forces all players to move to my current location and another that makes me swap places with a target--I couldn’t create scenarios that would flip the table on another person, to everyone else’s raucous laughter."
"At best, Demon Slayer: Sweep the Board is just a race to reach destination spots or Greater Demon spots to earn more Rank Points. Regardless of how well I did or how high my score was, minigames themselves only granted a smattering of coins to purchase items, and victories against Greater Demons offered but a handful of Rank Points. By the same token, the randomized way in which these spots showed up sometimes gave advantages to the closest player, and I had no control over these occurrences."
"Likewise, I was surprised to see that post-game rewards handed out by Kagaya, the mentor of the Hashira, were also random. In one match, bonus Rank Points were given to the one who spent the most gold. I then used up a lot of gold during my next run, only for the special reward to be given to the player who moved the most number of spaces. Outside of the main mode, it’s possible to retry each minigame and boss encounter in quick runs, as well as spend coins to unlock cosmetic rewards like stickers, anime avatars, alternate attires, and wallpapers, but it’s not very exciting to do."
"Despite being a huge fan of the series Demon Slayer: Sweep the Board offered very little to keep me entertained. A few hours in, the experience became repetitive and tedious to a degree that it’s hard to recommend to even the most ardent of manga and anime enthusiasts. You’re better off grabbing The Hinokami Chronicles, made by the same studio, if you’re into Demon Slayer, and those who prefer party games or board games already have a plethora of other options."
"This latest adventure is the beginning of something new for the MMO and aims to try something a little different with a number of unpredictable outcomes. You'd be setting yourself up for disappointment if you're expecting this expansion to offer the non-stop excitement and narrative revelations or Shadowbringers or Endwalker, but Dawntrail is still a great setup for a lower-stakes adventure, and one that ultimately makes Dawntrail's twist that much more compelling."
Major spoilers ahead for Dawntrail's story
"In this adventure, you set off across the ocean and sail west to the continent of Tural. Although you're technically on vacation, you're also on a mission: to help your new companion, Wuk Lamat, become the next Dawnservant of Tural and, in the process, find the fabled city of gold."
"While Endwalker hit the ground running and was rare with its respites, Dawntrail is leisurely paced as you compete in the rite of succession. It takes great care in getting you familiar with your new surroundings first and, as Alisaie puts it, ""For once, the fate of the world doesn't rest on our shoulders."" As a result, you're able to take in all the gorgeous sights with no sense of pressure to race against the clock."
"From the picturesque capital, Tuliyollal, to lush rainforests and dense jungles filled with flora and fauna, to mountainous regions under starry skies, there is no place in Dawntrail you won't want to stop and admire. Tural is among the most beautiful places the MMO has to offer, and its design is only enhanced thanks to the long-awaited graphics update, making this expansion's vibrant color palette and smallest details pop."
"As you travel these lands, it's clear so much thought and attention went into curating not just its locations, but also the many cultures of the people you meet along the way, like Hanuhanu, the Yok Huy, and the Xbr'aal. The lives of the Turali are as important to your journey as anything else in Dawntrail, and as you spend more and more time learning about their respective cultures and histories, you'll witness firsthand the impact they leave on the overarching story, especially the Yok Huy's traditions of remembering their loved ones."
"Final Fantasy XIV has often struggled with its pacing, especially when it comes to finding the time to address every single narrative thread. And while learning about the people of Tural is one of the most interesting parts of Dawntrail's story, in some places it feels like there is a lack of momentum when it comes to progression and the placement of some quests, which can disrupt the momentum. This issue improves somewhat in Dawntrail, which avoids overwhelming you with too much at once, mainly due to the fact that the story is consistent in its singular goal from the start. In the initial half of your journey, you'll rarely pick up your weapon outside of Duties, which makes a ton of room for you to get really absorbed in the characters and world around you."
"However, some questlines feel outdated and meandering in their presentation and can make you feel like you're not making any headway. Too often, you are tasked with walking from point A to point B to talk to an NPC, or ordered to collect an item, and repeat this loop. Quests like these are to be expected in an MMO, but even so, it's repetitive and unenjoyable. The stealth and companion follow quests in particular, which are seemingly used as a way to make the lack of action more engaging, are just plain tedious. That being said, the overall journey is appealing and engaging enough that these issues don't derail the plot entirely--they merely slow you down."
"One of the most intriguing aspects of this tale is the decision to establish Wuk Lamat as the central protagonist. You take a step back in this story to allow for the female Hrothgar to shine, and it's a decision that benefits the overall narrative brilliantly."
"Wuk Lamat is without a doubt the shining star of this expansion. It's her compassion and extroverted playfulness that makes her such an endearing companion and making the journey through Dawntrail that much more worthwhile. She is unapologetically herself, almost comically so, whether it be in her positive outlook on life or her love for her country; she's simply a joy to travel with. She's a fierce warrior, but is afraid of alpacas, will take on any challenge presented to her, but gets seasick. It's these characterizations, along with the terrific work from her English voice actor Sena Bryer, that makes Wuk Lamat one of the more memorable Final Fantasy XIV companions in recent memory. Without her by your side, Dawntrail just wouldn't be the same."
"She's a character you want to root for because, despite her positive exterior, she also has her flaws, along with personal challenges she must overcome on your journey together. As you travel from region to region, Wuk Lamat comes to understand that she isn't as familiar with her people as she originally thought, revealing her naivety in the process, which makes her doubt her worthiness for the throne."
"Step-by-step, with you by her side as her friend and guide, Wuk Lamat goes through a delightful journey of self-discovery, and it's rewarding to witness her character develop. Plus, the polarizing conflict at the center of her story makes for quite the compelling narrative twist part way through the expansion's story--it's a huge part of what makes the narrative extremely powerful, creating opportunities for unanticipated reveals and shocking consequences."
"Final Fantasy XIV has always worn its heart on its sleeve, and it's no different in Dawntrail. As you familiarize yourself with new characters and cultures, the game's themes begin to present themselves more clearly. Dawntrail is about friendship, family, and belonging, which are ideas that are intentionally tied to not only Wuk Lamat's journey to becoming the leader she's always envisioned herself as, but also to returning characters like Krile and Erenville, who are also driven by familial connections in their search for the city of gold."
"The most compelling facet of this narrative is the introduction of the mysterious Queen Sphene of Alexandria. Not introduced until the late stages of the story, Sphene is presented as a leader who loves her people and even considers them family, much like Wuk Lamat does. There's a clear distinction between the two, made even more obvious by their thematically opposing nations. While Tural is teeming with life and holds traditions close to their hearts, Alexandrian culture is a dystopia and technologically advanced."
"The Yok Huy and their traditions of ""remembering"" loved ones after they have passed and the Alexandrian way of forcibly removing the memories of those who die so they can artificially live on within ""the cloud"" as The Endless throws their differences into stark contrast and presents you with underlying questions about the meaning of death and what comes after, letting go and processing grief, as well as what it means to truly live and die."
"The duality of the two queens demonstrates an interesting, additional conflict altogether. They both love their homes, but while Wuk Lamat wishes to preserve peace for the good of everyone involved, Sphene will stop at nothing to put her people first. In true Final Fantasy XIV fashion, this conflict manages to find a way to pull on your heartstrings in the most unexpected ways and forces you to confront difficult decisions that not only affect the Alexandrians, but also your close companions. Some things aren't as they seem, and these decisions also come with consequences that could potentially have a lasting effect on this era's story going forward."
"When you are deep in the action, Dungeons and Trials both feel more challenging than ever, especially in terms of the boss mechanics. Though certainly manageable, you may have to be ultra-focused so as not to get hit by a particularly nasty AOE, or a complicated, continuous chain attack. I know I was. They feel tougher this time around, but are extremely fun and satisfying when you figure out the bosses' attack rotations alongside your party."
"Duty designs are also tailored brilliantly with their respective narrative beats, something Final Fantasy XIV has always excelled at. They're made even more thrilling thanks to the fantastic, sweeping musical tracks courtesy of composer Masayoshi Soken, who has once again proven that his music considerably contributes to bringing a story to life."
"With the latest expansion also came two brand-new Jobs, Viper and Pictomancer. Viper is a DPS class that engages enemies through the use of three-step combos, with the third step granting an effect to strengthen a different combo-ending action, and it's a thrill to play. At first, the Job can feel quite overwhelming simply due to the abundance of skills you're given straight away at level 80, so nailing those combos down correctly does take time to understand, making Viper one of the more difficult DPS Jobs. Once you do get into the swing of things, however, it's quite exciting to play. This class is slick and flashy as it relies on fast-paced attacks with your twin blades that can also be connected into a double-ended weapon for bigger AOE attacks, making you feel like you're really putting a dent in the enemy."
"Then there's Pictomancer, and the two Jobs couldn't be more different. While Viper is all about throwing out attack after attack and perfecting your combos for the best attack window, this ranged-magical DPS class is the most refreshing caster Job the game has seen in a while. The artistic Job mainly depends on you painting three canvases, two with corresponding spells that deal a ton of damage to the enemy, as well as a third canvas that will offer your party a helpful buff in battle on top of your other vital utility. With its vibrant spells taking up your screen to paint wonderful pictures, it's a really fun, whimsical class to play, with a rotation that is quite simple to get the hang of. It doesn't feel like a chore leveling up, and I'm hopeful for more charming and laid back Jobs just like it in the future."
"I had some concerns about how Dawntrail could introduce and wrap up an entire conflict in the second half of its expansion, but the story is able to tie up every major thread along the way, while also delivering an emotionally impactful resolution. Even though the story does have a firm end, it has also established some exciting prospects for the game going forward, especially when it comes to the expanding lore of Final Fantasy XIV and what could come next. It paves the way for new places to explore in future adventures and even does the necessary setup work to contextualize how the player will be involved in what awaits on the horizon."
"Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail is a great stepping stone in a brand-new saga for the MMO. While the story might seem straightforward at first, it soon takes an unexpected, yet compelling turn that presents new possibilities for this new era. Though some questlines can feel repetitive and outdated, they don't get in the way of an otherwise brilliant expansion, and the journey is made all the more enjoyable thanks to a wonderful new cast of characters at your side."
"More than almost any other genre, the metroidvania is reaching a saturation point. We have beloved modernizations like Hollow Knight and Axiom Verge and big-budget takes like Batman: Arkham Asylum or this year's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, alongside a steady, constant drumbeat of indie releases. It's hard to throw a rock at Steam without hitting at least a couple of metroidvanias, and with that much choice, it's hard for any one to stand out. Gestalt: Steam and Cinder is the latest indie take on the genre, but it manages to do what many others don't: pay homage to the two most prominent originators of the genre with smart, deliberate design choices that help it stand out in a crowded field."
"In some sense, all metroidvanias combine aspects of Super Metroid and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. Gestalt does so as well, but it also wisely leans on some of their best attributes, which feels like a conscious choice. For Super Metroid, that means a vast, interconnected world that is broken into a handful of distinct zones that play like their own stages. And like Symphony of the Night, it sports gorgeous pixel art with an emphasis on slick combat with light RPG hooks."
"In Gestalt, you play as Aletheia, a no-nonsense bounty hunter who is on semi-friendly terms with the governing body of Canaan, a post-apocalyptic steampunk city. The world has recovered from the devastation of a war involving clockwork soldiers and cursed armor, but the stability is tense and everyone senses it's coming to an end. You get the impression throughout that Canaan's peacekeepers have tried to recruit Aletheia at various points, but she's always preferred to go her own way because she is, above all else, a cool, independent protagonist. Taking bounties ultimately leads to trouble as she investigates the areas around Canaan for clues about what's really going on."
"Functionally, that means the map is separated into distinct zones that would feel right at home on Super Metroid's planet Zebes. The areas are visually distinct from each other, and for the most part, you complete one ""stage"" before moving on to the next. You can still backtrack to older areas to reach new areas that you couldn't before, but you won't be criss-crossing between areas repeatedly. I found it a refreshing change of pace to have a slightly more structured metroidvania that minimizes backtracking between areas."
"That said, the map is much less detailed than the grid-based one you'd find in Super Metroid and many games inspired by it. You won't get the satisfaction of filling in every grid-chunk on a map. Despite that, I had no trouble finding my way around even when revisiting areas to find extra treasures, so the map did its job adequately."
"That's partly because exploration is not heavily emphasized in your abilities. Though you do get a handful of exploration-based abilities, most areas aren't actually ability-gated. The ones you do get are likely what you've come to expect from a metroidvania, like a double-jump or an air dash. But those ability gates are smartly implemented into a large upgrade matrix. Instead of a starting point with branches like a tree, you can see the full suite of abilities from the start. As you get new ones throughout the story, they unlock nodes that generally correspond to the four corners, which lets you buy connecting abilities starting from that direction. Some of the strongest are at the midpoint between nodes and only unlock when you've approached from both sides. That lets the game dole out abilities at a deliberate pace, while also giving you a lot of control over your choices about which super-abilities you want to build towards."
"And while it carries itself with a retro aesthetic, the combat mechanics had one noticeable modern touch. Given the look and feel of the game, I had tried to approach combat encounters by avoiding getting too close to enemies, assuming that pressing against them would cause me to suffer damage. But much like a 3D action game, that isn't the case. You can hug enemies, roll right into them, strike, and then roll away. After a slight adjustment period, this felt very intuitive for the combat system, which is largely built around close-quarters attacks and dodge-rolling out of the way. (It is, however, somewhat odd to have a forward dodge-roll and a backward dodge-flip assigned to two different buttons, despite them functioning almost identically. I barely used the dodge-flip.)"
"Combat is also augmented by a long-range pistol, with extremely limited ammo that gets refreshed through building up energy with melee attacks. You can shoot a normal bullet, but the pistol's special Tesla-infused bullets are necessary to stagger tougher, shielded enemies (as well as to charge certain electronic devices). Encounters are often a delicate balance of closing distance, attacking to build your meter, backing off to fire off a couple of debilitating shots, and then closing the gap to go in for the kill. It's a thrilling dance, and made more so as you unlock more specialized abilities like charged shots or fiery, screen-filling melees."
"Gestalt also implements a light equipment and item system, with accessories for stat bonuses and potions that give you temporary buffs. I hardly ever needed to use items outside of a refillable healing flask, but rejiggering my accessories frequently made a huge difference--especially once I began finding more parts to craft new and upgraded versions for them by doing side quests."
"Thanks largely to the smart upgrade and equipment system, I found the combat difficulty to be a nicely inviting and smooth ramp, albeit one where the challenge didn't quite scale to match my power. Near the beginning of the game, I was trying boss encounters at least a few times, and more often than not, grinding to unlock another few upgrade nodes before going back to try again. By the end, I was breezing through every boss on the first try without much difficulty. That makes the combat feel empowering, if not especially challenging as you near the end."
"One aspect where Gestalt: Steam and Cinder should have borrowed more inspiration from its inspirations, though, is in its story presentation. Super Metroid is famously minimalist, telling most of its haunting story through silent vignettes. Symphony of the Night tells a more detailed story but does it through short, punchy and campy dialogue sequences. Gestalt by comparison is extremely lore-heavy, to the point that it sometimes bogs down the experience. Dialogue sequences are both overlong and dense, littered with proper nouns that make it difficult to track. I often wished for a glossary to refresh my memory about what various terms meant. By the end, I felt confident that I was understanding the general gist, but the story it was telling did not warrant the sheer volume of text."
"However, the vast majority of my time was not spent wading through inscrutable dialogue. It was spent exploring a diverse steampunk world, mastering the surprisingly rich combat, and filling out the smartly-designed skill tree. Gestalt: Steam and Cinder is a joyful journey into nostalgic metroidvania action, and a great start for a potential franchise."
"Nintendo deserves and often rightly gets a lot of credit for the proliferation of esports and speedrunning, two competitive video game subcultures that have exploded in recent years. The Nintendo World Championships events were among the first high-profile, publisher-led efforts at esports, and many of the best-known speedrunning records are based on classic NES games. It makes sense, then, that Nintendo would capitalize on its place in history with Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition, a hybrid speedrunning tutorial and ongoing online competition for Nintendo Switch. While the tools are a bit barebones for true speedrun enthusiasts, the presentation nicely preserves and illuminates the joy of racing to shave milliseconds off your best time."
"Nintendo World Championships kicks off on a self-congratulatory tone, having you peruse icons, favorite NES games, and ""Hype Tags""--slogans from throughout Nintendo history--to build your profile. The icons are all from Nintendo-published NES games, but the ""favorite games"" include lots of third-party games and even Famicom listings. Similarly, the slogans run the gamut from nostalgic (""Plays With Power"") to more contemporary (""Retro Game Collector""). It's a nice little touch of personalization to welcome you into Nintendo's long history."
"Once you've created your profile, you can choose One Player or Party Mode. The One Player menu greets you with three gameplay options: Speedrun Mode, World Championships, and Survival Mode. Speedrun Mode makes for the bulk of single-player, and is composed of a large collection of challenges from across 13 classic Nintendo games. Those challenges are then reused for the solo online play and Party Mode challenges. The challenges include each NES Super Mario Bros. game (including the so-called Lost Levels), Metroid, The Legend of Zelda, Donkey Kong, Kirby, Excitebike, and Balloon Fight, among others."
"The challenges themselves are quick, lasting anywhere from a few seconds to a handful of minutes, but the presentation immediately stands out as smart, clean design that emphasizes improving your runs. The preview screen for a run shows you the goal in a clear, digestible way. Your current run is displayed on the left side of a split-screen, while your prior best run is shown simultaneously on the right. The split-screen even has a small controller-map display to show which buttons you're pressing throughout your current and prior runs. For runs that require you to traverse through different screens, arrows will point you in the right direction. Pausing in a run is disallowed, but you can quick-restart with a tap of the shoulder buttons, or end one entirely with ZR and ZL. When you reach the final ""Master"" level challenge for each game, you get access to an old-school strategy-guide layout showing you what you need to do. It's even called ""Classified Information,"" which is a sweet little hat-tip to the strategy section of the old Nintendo Power magazine."
"Many of these assists can be turned off, but they combine to create an experience that is less about figuring out your goals, as you usually would in a classic Zelda or Metroid, and more about educating yourself so that you can start doing it as quickly as you can. It falls short of being a full-fledged interactive museum like Atari 50, but instead nicely fulfills its purpose of showing newcomers the ropes of speedrunning."
"I say newcomers, though, because while the tools are nicely laid out and the presentation is very approachable, there isn't much customization to be had for more serious speedrunning enthusiasts. For example, the speedruns are based purely on your completion time, and there is no toggle to disqualify a run based on factors like taking damage. That means that sometimes you can power your way through by getting hit without a time penalty, and it will still count as faster than performing the same run without taking a hit while more carefully avoiding obstacles. When there are extra criteria to meet--like not overheating in Excitebike, for example--you only learn about this condition by doing it, at which point the game will automatically rewind you with a penalty for the time spent. And while you get letter grades (C, B, B+, B++, A, A+, A++, and S), the interface is oddly unclear about what time-marks correspond to which letter grade. If you want to make sure you hit at least an A-rank, which rewards you with a special pin for your profile and extra coins, you won't know what the target time was until you surpass it."
"The speedrunning community has flourished in part due to its creativity in coming up with new challenges to push itself, and the lack of options here sacrifices that for simplicity. That makes it a good starting point for those curious about the community or looking for a new way to engage with their favorite retro games, but it's not more ambitious than that."
"Additionally, there is a freely available challenge for each game that, upon completion, earns you coins to unlock further challenges. Unlocking these challenges gets progressively more expensive as they grow more challenging, which unfortunately highlights another way Nintendo World Championship's design feels somewhat at odds with itself. You only earn coins for completed challenges, so using the quick-restart if you notice a mistake gives you no currency to spend. But quick-restarting a speedrunning challenge is vital to how real speedrunners hone their craft, practice, and perfect their runs. It simply doesn't feel good to restart a challenge five times for a good run and only get rewarded a small amount of coins for the last one. Even a bad grade in a completed challenge earns you something, so it's often better to complete a bad run than to restart it, despite the wasted time this entails. And while unlocks come fast and easily at first, the final challenges are significantly more expensive, forcing you to grind."
"To earn enough coins to unlock all the challenges, you realistically need to engage with the game's asynchronous online modes, which will rotate in new challenges regularly. The World Championships Mode collects five challenges of various difficulties and lets you play them as many times as you want to set your best record. At the end of the competition period, you'll see your ranking against all other players, and those who share your birth year--a welcome feature for younger kids who want to compete against each other, or older gamers like myself who know we don't stand a chance against the reaction times of teenagers. Survival Mode gets closer to imitating a live competition, having you race against the ghost data of seven other players between three events in random order, eliminating players after each challenge. It isn't live, but you get to see the other players' runs concurrently with your own, so it feels thrilling in the same way."
"Similarly, the couch co-op Party Mode pits you against up to seven other players in one location. Unlike the asynchronous online modes, these challenges are taken on simultaneously through a variety of pre-selected packs of stages, or you can select your own speedrun challenges for competition. It's a quick, no-frills way to compete against your friends sitting side by side--though I would imagine you may need a rather large TV if you want to take advantage of the full eight-player limit."
"The online modes feature a few flourishes not present in Speedrun mode, like simulated crowd noises matched to your performance--cheers when you finish, and ""awws"" when you fall short. They also grant you coins at a much faster rate, so keeping up with them will be a must to unlock all the challenges and profile images. And of course, it also seems like the most fertile ground for iteration, as Nintendo could introduce weeks built around a particular game or theme."
"And that would be apt, because Nintendo World Championship: NES Edition feels more like a platform than a game in itself. It's a set of tools to gently introduce players to speedrunning, and to encourage some light competitive hooks. Even the ""NES Edition"" part of the name suggests this is envisioned as an ongoing project with room for further exploration in the future. I hope it does, because this could serve as a great introduction to invite newcomers into the speedrunning community."
"As is tradition, Master Splinter has been kidnapped, and it’s up to the four turtles to battle through four levels of roguelite action to get him back. Each run starts in the sewers, moving room to room as you clear enemies and collect power-ups along the way. When you die, you are transported back to the turtle’s lair to regroup, buy a few upgrades, and start again."
"Splintered Fates was originally a mobile game, but it was built with modern high-spec devices and access to controllers in mind. As a result, its solid core gameplay loop feels right at home on the Nintendo Switch. Delivering attacks before quickly dashing away to avoid damage generally feels fast and fluid. Intense fights near the end of a run can be a dizzying whirlwind as you prioritize targets and deliver blows in the small gaps in which enemies are vulnerable. Attacks quickly charge up a powerful special attack and a tool with a unique power, like Michelangelo’s taunt, which stuns and damages enemies in a small area of effect."
"While it's centered around a notoriously kid-friendly franchise, this certainly isn’t an easy action game geared toward the youngest or inexperienced gamers. Splintered Fates is a solid challenge. A full runthrough can take around 40-minutes depending on your stick skills and luck with power-ups, but, as befitting a roguelite, expect quite a few attempts to end in failure. It toes the line between being hard enough to be engaging, without veering into frustrating. If you prefer a more laid-back time with the Heroes in a Half-Shell, you can switch into easy mode at any time."
"As you progress through each closed arena, taking out evil ninjas, giant rats, and laser-spewing robots as you go, you’ll be rewarded with a random assortment of perks after each encounter. That’s where the strategic elements come into play. You could opt for short-term boosts, like attack boosts, or lighting that comes down to strike your enemies at regular intervals. But you might be better off playing the long game, grabbing Dragon or Dreamer Coins, which won’t help you on the run in progress, but will make you incrementally and permanently stronger. Agonizing over a tough choice is fun, and it’s a thrill when you decide to go all-in on a run and it pays off."
"Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and Hades is a great game--though it does mean the areas where Splintered Fate falls short tend to stick out more. The still images used during story moments, for example, are fine, but not nearly as memorable as the ones used to tell the tale of Zagreus and company. The taunts and jabs when you fight the same bosses on repeated runs are entertaining, but, massive jaws aside, Leatherhead just doesn’t have the same bite as Megaera."
"If there’s an area where TMNT Splintered Fates stands alone, it’s in the quadrumvirate of main characters. Each turtle feels distinct thanks to their different weapons, unique attack patterns, and their varied special attacks. Donetello, the brainiac of the bunch, has a lot of range thanks to his bo staff and can put up a temporary shield, whereas hothead Raphael specializes in up-close DPS with rapid-fire attacks from his sai. It does a great job wrapping a playstyle around each character's personality, and changing up which turtle you control keeps repeated runs feeling fresh."
"Playing co-op with friends can be a chaotic blast, whether it’s online, or on the same couch. It’s the exact same experience as single-player, except with friends, which is great. Four turtles smashing and slashing their way through the campaign is a wild spectacle. The only issue here is the post-map reward structure. Each turtle takes turns picking their perks, which means a full four-person team spends a lot of time in menus, especially in the early half of a run where a full team can clear a room in under a minute. It’s a drag to the otherwise breakneck pace."
"Unfortunately, co-op also shows just how big the gap is between the latest mobile devices and the dated hardware in the Nintendo Switch. Slowdown is an occasional nuisance in single-player, but when four turtles are all filling the screen with flashy attacks, the framerate drops considerably. There’s a cinematic mode that caps the frame rate at 30fps, but it seems like an extraneous feature given how much of a run seemed to be below that threshold. It’s not so severe as to ruin the experience, but it is frustrating to mistime a dodge and take damage because of it."
"There’s a solid amount of variation from one run to another. The upgrades you acquire stack on top of each other and can lead to interesting builds, like one that covers enemies in a damaging ooze combined with another that increases the power of damage-over-time abilities. Each level has an assortment of mini-bosses that they will shuffle through, and the bosses will mix things up with different attacks and tactics. Karai, for example, might focus on throwing kunai at you between attacks in one fight, but switch to covering the ground in fire attacks the next. It’s enough to keep each run feeling fresh, even after almost two dozen attempts, though it can be frustrating when it feels like luck puts every fight on hard mode."
"That increases even more after your first successful run. Without spoiling what happens in the endgame, you are encouraged to go through all of the levels more after you reach the end. This time, some areas will have additional exits that lead to harder variations of bosses, or implement modifiers that make getting through sections more difficult. It’s optional, but taking it on gives greater rewards of upgrade currencies, and, as the upgrades accumulate and you become more powerful, help keep the levels challenging."
"It’s easy to reduce Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate down to just a Hades clone with a TMNT skin, as I did previously. And while that description is pretty accurate, the sentiment doesn't convey that a well-done take on a fantastic game can be a lot of fun. While the art and story don’t come near the lofty heights of Hades, it is nevertheless a blast to bash heads as one of the titular turtles, especially when you have friends fighting at your side. Technical issues aside, Splintered Fate is a fun time, and with a good variety to shake things up from run to run."
"One area in which Flintlock immediately stands out amongst its contemporaries is its unique setting. Mixing magical high fantasy with elements from the 17th to 19th century and the advent of gunpowder, Flintlock's world is immediately intriguing. For your part, you're strapped into the boots of protagonist Nor Vanek, a sapper in the Coalition army who unwittingly breaks a seal to the Great Below, unleashing malevolent Gods and their armies of the dead upon the lands of Kian. This act sets in motion a fairly straightforward story as Nor--wracked with guilt over condemning her home to near-annihilation--sets out on a path of vengeance to kill the Gods and retake the world. She's joined by a mysterious fox-like companion called Enki, who's keen to share his knowledge of the Gods while aiding Nor's efforts with a host of magical abilities."
"The narrative's simple, laser-focused approach works in the game's favor, giving you a clear end goal to pursue that aligns with the snappy pacing of its action and movement. There are moments of interpersonal conflict, but the story never deviates from its deicidal path, lending the narrative a purposeful sense of forward momentum that carries it through to the end. The trade-off, however, is that you're unlikely to feel any attachment to its small cast of one-dimensional characters, despite enjoyable performances from Olive Gray (Halo), Alistar Petrie (Sex Education), and Elias Toufexis (Deus Ex: Mankind Divided)."
"I also wish there was more to its anomalous world, which is only intriguing at first glance. Moments of downtime are sometimes punctuated by Enki explaining the nature of the Great Below and the role of the Gods, but no such effort is afforded to the setting and its inhabitants. The game's environments are varied, both from a natural point of view and an architectural one--pulling influences from the likes of ancient Egypt, the Renaissance era, and the American Revolutionary War--yet it offers no explanation as to how these disparate elements came together. As a result, much of the game feels like mere set dressing. It's possible I missed some optional conversations that cover this aspect of the game, but I know for sure it's not upfront about it, nor is this information scattered away in hidden notes or item descriptions."
"Fortunately, Flintlock's level design is uniformly excellent. The first thing that jumps out about its locales is the sheer verticality present in almost every space. Rather than navigating through twisting labyrinths that corkscrew and fold back on themselves, you typically travel from one end of a large map to another. Along the way, there are numerous opportunities to venture off the beaten path, and you're constantly rewarded for exploring with crucial discoveries such as upgrade materials and health-boosting shrines."
"You might occasionally create a shortcut by opening up a metal gate, but for the most part, you're finding magical portals that you can leap between with Enki's help. Sometimes, these portals create paths backward, conjuring a different type of shortcut. Other times, they veer upwards, letting you launch into the sky and make use of the game's verticality to traverse the environment and gain the element of surprise on enemies below. Combine this with Nor's mobility--including double-jump and dash moves--and platforming in Flintlock is a constant delight as you rapidly hurtle over chasms and leap between rooftops. It can feel a tad floaty and weightless at times, but the game rarely demands precision platforming to the point where this becomes an issue."
"For as crucial as traversing the lands of Kian is, Flintlock's combat is its true bread and butter. Nor comes locked and loaded with a small arsenal of deadly armaments, including a melee weapon, a primary firearm like a pistol or the eponymous flintlock, and a secondary firearm such as a musket or fire-spitting flamethrower. Melee combat consists of the usual mix of light and heavy attacks, and you can dodge, block, and parry incoming strikes, too."
"Some enemies will lunge at you with signposted unblockable attacks that can be sidestepped or, in a similar vein to Bloodborne's gun-parrying, halted with a blast from your primary firearm--the catch being that you can only fire off a few of these shots before you need to recharge your black powder supply by getting in a few melee hits. This incentivizes you to play aggressively, especially when you consider Nor's fleet-footedness and the fact you're not restricted by a stamina meter. There's a souls-like tinge embedded in Flintlock's melee fisticuffs, but it's more of a forgiving power fantasy than its peers."
"Enki plays an essential role in this and the overall flow of combat. He has his own attacks that both curse enemies and build up their priming gauge. Striking enemies inflicted with the curse of death further builds this meter, and when it's full, your foes enter a primed state that leaves them wide open to a deadly critical attack. This is particularly useful against armored and shield-wielding enemies, allowing you to remove their extra protection and connect with the fleshy bits. Enki proves helpful with some of his passive tricks, too, taunting and distracting enemies when you're outnumbered."
"Meanwhile, his ultimate-style Witherings let you unleash powerful abilities in a pinch, perhaps empowering your weapons with magical energy or summoning a storm that explodes from within. There's often a lot going on in a single battle, but it feels intuitive and quickly becomes second nature to pepper an enemy with Enki's attacks, parry an incoming strike with a blast from your pistol, and then transition into a combo of melee attacks before using a musket to send a small metal ball hurtling through your opponent's skull."
"More formidable and hard-hitting foes demand a level of patience and studious insight into their attack patterns, but on its normal difficulty setting, Flintlock provides the occasional challenge without ever being particularly tough. Enemy attacks are clearly telegraphed, and the timing window on counters is generous and, thus, relatively easy to pull off consistently. A hard difficulty setting is there for those craving more of a merciless challenge, while a ""story"" mode lowers the difficulty a notch further for anyone seeking an easier time. Although it is worth noting that the latter disables all achievements, which is an odd decision when so many other games are doing the opposite."
"However you decide to play, Flintlock's axe-slashing and pistol-shooting looks stylish and feels impactful. Stopping an enemy in its tracks with the thunderous clap of a blunderbuss is always satisfying, as is following up with a flurry of blows from an armor-piercing mallet or fire-tinged axe. There's a sense of imprecision that occasionally rears its ugly head, whether it's due to animations not quite lining up or the window to cancel an attack into a parry feeling too long and rigid. These aren't deal breakers, but they are something you might need to adjust to."
"In terms of progression, the currency of experience points you accrue is simply called reputation. You earn reputation with each kill, but in a unique twist on the usual formula, every successful strike, dodge, and parry you perform also adds a bonus multiplier. This sees the amount of reputation you can earn go up in increments, from 5% extra rep up to 100%. Suddenly, 500 reputation is worth 1,000 and you're swimming in currency. It's your choice when to cash in, too, because getting hit wipes out the multiplier completely, forcing you to bank only the lowest amount of reputation possible. Flintlock already encourages you to play on the front foot, but now you're also incentivized to dispatch enemies as swiftly as you can without getting hit. It's classic risk-and-reward, where each battle becomes a gamble. Even if it's not the most challenging game, striving to achieve the perfect fight adds a degree of delectable tension to every clash of steel."
"Once you've accumulated enough reputation, you can spend it on a skill tree that enhances your ranged, magic, and melee damage as you unlock new abilities related to each one. There are active skills like powerful charged attacks, passive skills that might improve critical attacks against armored enemies, and utility skills that can expand the window to execute a perfect reload. These abilities expand your repertoire in palpable ways, and you can also spend reputation to improve various facets of your weapons."
"Weapon upgrades are fairly expensive, however, particularly if you've already achieved the highest rarity with one already. Upgrading another melee weapon to match the level of the axe I was already using felt superfluous when I still had ranged weapons and new skills to unlock, eating into my supply of resources and reputation. I ended up sticking with the same axe for the majority of the game as a result, and was disappointed that I couldn't experiment with more melee weapons without impeding myself elsewhere."
"Flintlock is not the kind of game where you're going to see a ton of build variety. It's a stripped-back action RPG, sprinkling in a few souls-like elements to a broth whose dominant flavor is hyper-mobile combat and traversal that's never too punishing. It has its faults, from failing to expand on a setting that's only interesting on paper to featuring a prohibitive weapon upgrade system and some imprecision in its combat. It might not sit at the forefront of your mind for long after the credits have rolled, but in the moment, Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn is a rip-roaring good time that's likely to appeal to both newcomers and hardened Souls' fans alike. Hopefully more games take some cues from its uncommon approach."
"The creature-collector genre is dominated by Pokemon and filled out from there with many games heavily inspired by it. Through a certain lens, Flock is a creature collector, too, but if you go into it looking for a game very much like Pokemon, you won't find it. The task of filling out your Pokedex-like Field Guide by discovering a world of (mostly) fantastical creatures, each with their own physical and behavioral traits, is very much like the genre's titan, but beyond that, Flock is much more lax, not to mention charming and delicate. It's better described as a creature observer, and that novel approach winds up being very enjoyable."
"Flock takes place in a gorgeously colorful wilderness called The Uplands. As the customizable player character and bird-rider, you and an optional co-op partner head into a small camp where your aunt and some pals need your help cataloging the many critters roaming the land. The entire game takes place on the back of your feathered friend, and the game's way of automatically adjusting your flight path vertically, while you do so horizontally, makes it all very easy to control. It feels light and fun in your hands, like going down a slide at the playground."
"This child-like spirit is present throughout the game, from its candy-colored trees and plains to its small cast of characters who speak mostly in terms players of all ages can understand, but who occasionally pack a hint of something more grown-up in their musings. I found it similar to how characters on many Cartoon Network shows speak. It isn't trying to be subversive, like a Dreamworks movie sneaking in an adult joke; rather, it treats its audience with some maturity, expressed in the words characters choose. It's immediately inviting, and the game's soft music makes for a perpetually calming soundtrack that keep game feeling meditative and decompressing."
"Effectively, this creature collector is more akin to a bird-watching game, though I hesitate to call it a ""simulation"" since you're riding on a bird and observing animals that don't exist on Earth, and you do it all with pretty simple mechanics. There are a dozen species to discover, such as Bewls, Sprugs, Drupes, and more, and each time you encounter a new critter, you'll be asked to guess which family they belong to and specify which type they are."
"Not all Drupes are identical, after all; you may guess you've found yourself such an animal, but are they a Wandering Drupe, a Balsamic Drupe, a Yellowlegs, or another kind? This is resolved by observing their behavior and appearance, then choosing their identity from a list of short descriptions of each type of Drupe. You'll get two tries, after which point the game (via your aunt's forgiving instruction) just tells you the right answer."
"Naturally, the names of some creatures are helpful--the Yellowlegs has yellow legs, of course. But sometimes, more than one animal in a species may have a particular trait, which means you'll want to inspect a bit more closely. Do they have a unique gait? Do they change colors? Do they travel in small groups? Since the game equips you with some pertinent details of each animal before you've even met any of them, choosing the right one from the list is generally easy even if some are a bit tougher than others to differentiate."
"And more than being easy, it's forgiving. There's no penalty for getting anything wrong, and neither is there a gamified reward for getting things right. It all feels very purposely low-stakes, and I appreciate it for that. Flock is a video game and does some video-gamey things, but it's never really keeping score. There are few fail states and no game-over screens. You're given a charming world to discover, which for me is reliably rewarding enough."
"Where discovering an animal is the first step, and identifying them is the second, charming them is the third. To charm any animal, you'll need to know their call, which you learn by finding whistles scattered across the world. Both finding whistles and using them is, like identifying animals, extremely easy. In the former's case, you'll send your sheep out to eat domes of grass, thereby revealing a Burgling Bewl--a critter known to run off with people's belongings--who then forks over their pilfered item."
"Retrieving your aunt's 12 whistles means you'll eventually be able to charm any species in the game, which is done via a brief minigame in which you try to line up some on-screen shapes and play the notes at the right time, effectively making it a quick-time event. You can actually fail these, which means alarming the animal and sending them scurrying off. But the number of animals in the world is not finite; another will soon appear if you zip around their habitat for a bit."
"As you progress, the clouds coating the landscape will dissipate to reveal new biomes, some of them home to specific types of animals or even whole species you haven't seen yet. Each biome also houses more researchers like yourself, NPCs who offer you tips and trade challenges for wool, which can also be gathered from your sheep and used as currency to unlock silly clothing options like ""Mustard Style"" clothes, a line of hats, shirts, and more all predominantly colored like the condiment."
"While I thoroughly enjoyed all of these simple tasks, one of the game's best aspects happens to be a bit more complex. The process of finding the dozens of different animals can sometimes demand very specific antecedents, like checking in a specific biome at a certain time of day, or perhaps only spotting them from some distance away using the game's focus mode, as some animals are shy or standoffish."
"One particular animal must be found by following trails of elusive smoke; another is only discovered after you investigate a number of colorful and oily markings; and another blends in like drooping fungi in a mushroom forest. I haven't found every last one of them yet, but the act of meeting each and every type of animal in the game is actually more enticing as the game goes on, as the final handful can be particularly tricky."
"In this way, Flock works opposite many other games. Whereas normally obtaining every last collectible item in a game feels like an increasing grind as the game goes on, in Flock, I very much want to complete my Field Guide. With 55 animals in the game, many of them offer these more involved steps and make for the game's most-earned discoveries. There are even a few who are so rare that they haven't a name yet, allowing you to select their name from a list of several suggestions, each of them carrying the game's cozy and welcoming vibe forward."
"A lot of creature collectors cast the player-character as a powerful human who lords over their captures and sends them into battle to earn human-centric rewards, a formula that has not just fatigued me, but long made me uncomfortable. Refreshingly, Flock feels more like an ecosystem, one in which you are a member but never the ruling body. You don't capture animals, you just hang out with them. When charmed, they trail behind you, creating a parade of diverse animals. There is neither hurt nor dominion in Flock's Uplands. You aren't there to grasp nature and empower yourself. You're there to study the world and help a family member in the process. That's all, and that change of pace and point of view is one of my favorite parts of the game."
"My gripes with the game are few in number. Though the game's objectives are frequently easy enough, some instructions are only given in dialogue with NPCs, and if you miss some pertinent information, there's no way to recall or play back what you were told, and the quest log sometimes doesn't say either. This once led to me being stumped for a while when I unlocked a new biome and then didn't know where to focus, having overlooked a line in which my objective was hinted at."
"I also consistently forgot to recall my sheep after they'd eat up some of the pasture to help me reveal Burgling Bewls. I never saw a reason for these sheep to need me to actively recall them from a design perspective, which meant some occasional frustration when I'd zoom across the land to complete a task, only to realize too late that I'd left my sheep on a hill some hundreds of meters away. It's not a big open world, so neither is it a big problem, but it seems like the sheep should just return to me after they've cleared the hilly pasture and I've claimed my reward hidden beneath the tall grass. Having said that, these are minor annoyances that didn't hinder my experience for too long in any instance."
"Flock's mostly simple mechanics and colorful world mean it all plays like a hug. With its low barrier of entry, people of all ages and skill levels can enjoy the game, and in two-player co-op, even enjoy it together. When things do get a bit more complex, that leads to some of the game's most rewarding moments, like discovering and naming super-elusive animals, or eventually filling out the all-important Field Guide with every critter and call seen and heard in the Uplands. Flock paints the picture of a world that welcomes you with open arms and equips you with tools to reciprocate the same admiration and respect for its dozens of interesting creatures."
"Zenless Zone Zero (ZZZ) is HoYoverse's third game launch in four years. You'd think that HoYo's formula would get stale with yet another free-to-play gacha RPG dropping just 15 months after the release of Honkai: Star Rail, but that couldn't be further from the truth. The developer has managed to create another familiar but distinct gameplay experience by once again learning from past missteps to deliver a game that is both iterative and innovative at the same time. The downside here, however, is that ZZZ puts several new and interesting elements together but forces you to spend the most time with the least interesting of the bunch."
"Zenless Zone Zero has more style and aesthetic excellence than both Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail, all in a much smaller package in terms of world size and scale of locations. At this point, Genshin Impact's open-world has become almost too large and sprawling to facilitate a comfortable or compact mobile gaming experience, meaning it's best experienced on PC or console. Meanwhile, Star Rail is the exact opposite because its turn-based combat and auto-battle features are a perfect fit for mobile devices. Zenless Zone Zero sits squarely in the middle of those two experiences by combining roguelike puzzle dungeons, fast-paced action combat, and chill life-sim activities into one varied gameplay loop."
"The story also deviates from what we've come to expect from HoYoverse. The world-building is still strong, but it's scaled back considerably. Instead of high-stakes conflicts with gods and higher powers, so far, Zenless Zone Zero has you follow the daily lives of two tech-genius siblings--Wise and Belle--as they find ways to make money legally and illegally. You get to pick which sibling you play as, but no matter who you go with, both remain in the story as characters who get regular dialogue. The main difference is that you choose what your protagonist says and control them while exploring the city of New Eridu."
"Wise and Belle work as Proxies--individuals who can share their consciousness and sync with small electronic creatures named Bangboos. Syncing with a Bangboo allows the duo to use the Hollow Deep Dive (HDD) system to guide scavengers known as Hollow Raiders as they explore and navigate dangerous, shifting dimensions called Hollows. A lot of these terms get thrown at you from the jump, but they'll become relatively easy to piece together and remember by the end of the prologue chapter. The siblings use and share the alias Phaethon when working as Proxies since scavenging Hollows for treasure and loot is an illegal line of work. They're the most well-known Proxies in New Eridu though, so Hollow Raiders often pay them top dollar for their services. And outside of their Phaethon persona, they manage an old-school video rental store, Random Play, to earn money on the right side of the law as a cover for their shadier ventures."
"Although the stakes are low as of Version 1.0, Zenless Zone Zero does an amazing job of addressing common pacing problems that have plagued past HoYo games by telling its story with stellar presentation. Comic-book paneling and character portraits keep nearly all major dialogue from becoming stale. The comics keep you engaged as they slide from scene to scene with the option to return to previous panels if you miss any information. Meanwhile, character portrait conversations are fully animated to convey realistic emotions through mannerisms that help you understand the demeanor of the characters who are speaking. And both the comics and portraits are fully voice-acted--including all dialogue from Wise and Belle."
"There are three main types of commissions: Story, Combat, and Exploration. Story commissions are usually the most interesting, as they relate to the main plot and use more of the storytelling elements mentioned above, mixed with the TV boards and combat sections. These commissions become available as you progress but are sometimes gated by level requirements that force you to do other commission types and complete side activities in the city. This is par for the course in a lot of gacha games, but it can be frustrating to grind through less engaging content to get back to the good stuff. That said, the early level grind in Zenless Zone Zero at least feels much quicker than in previous HoYo games because of how little time it takes to finish commissions."
"Combat commissions are strictly about fighting different enemy types found inside Hollows, giving you a chance to take control of your favorite Agents (characters you can pull for with the gacha features). Exploration commissions are the weakest of the bunch, as they mostly involve solving extremely simple puzzles on the Hollow TV boards with little to no combat opportunities whatsoever. Exploration commissions wouldn't feel as tedious if the puzzles offered more of a challenge, but as it stands, they feel like a chore. They come in stark contrast with Combat commissions, which can be completed on more than one difficulty with timed objectives to test your skills and squad building."
"There are two main offense buttons: one for basic attacks and the other for special attacks. A meter fills as you perform basic attacks, and once it's full, you can use special attacks and EX special attacks for more damaging combo chains. There's also a dodge that you can use to evade enemy moves at the last second when an indicator flashes. Perfect evades slow down time to create more offensive openings, and as you attack, enemies' Daze meters will increase, eventually stunning them."
"The real star feature in combat, however, is the Assist mechanic, which allows you to instantly swap between your three party members. Swapping characters right before an enemy attacks leads to Perfect Assist parries, evades, and special interrupt moves that trigger some of the most visually exciting moments in the game. Perfect Assists consume Assist Points, and you need to stun enemies and perform chain attacks with your party to regain these points. Otherwise, you can only use regular evades to dodge enemy attacks. You're rewarded for your reaction time whether you have Assist Points to use or not though. The Assist switches, along with the beautiful animations and presentation, are what make the combat so engaging."
"But as noted earlier, the combat is too easy, especially early on before hard mode and the endgame are unlocked. You can button-mash all you want as long as you get your defensive timing down. Defensive timing matters because there are no healers on the roster. Instead, you can pick up and use healing items while moving through the TVs in Hollows. There are Agents who create shields and specialize in tanking or support as alternatives, but realistically, you should be avoiding most damage with well-timed evades."
"Your choice of attacks rarely feels like it matters, though, as long as you can keep up a combo to gain Decibels--the energy that fuels Ultimate attacks. There are so many well-crafted animations and awesome abilities, yet they don't matter as much as they should. For example, Lucy plays baseball with her Guard Boars to attack, while Nicole shoots bullets and bombs out of a small briefcase. But I don't need to worry about each character's unique move set because enemy encounters consistently feel trivial. Unless you're going up against a boss--which are often fun, cool battles--mobs just stand around, waiting to be killed while throwing out attacks that would barely hurt even if they did land. Maybe this will change as we move forward from Version 1.0, but as of right now, even the higher-difficulty fights could stand to be harder. On the flip side, this allows you to build whichever characters you like most without worrying about any sort of meta, for the most part."
"Your choice of party members is almost more important than what you actually do with them in combat, as having a mixture of weapon ranges and elemental abilities to target enemy weaknesses makes fights easier. So, you should build at least a couple of characters for each element, but it doesn’t feel like their role (Attacker, Support, or Stun) makes a noticeable difference as you breeze through the main storyline. Agents with the same faction or elemental attribute also gain extra combat abilities. It's a nice touch that characters who know each other and work together in the story have added meaningful synergy in combat."
"The ZZZ endgame dungeon crawler mode, Hollow Zero, is one of the only parts of the game where you see a challenge in combat, but it would be nice if the game taught you better habits or strategies with tougher enemies before reaching that point."
"When you're not exploring Hollows, your perfectly legal day job involves managing the Random Play video rental store. Your managerial tasks include retrieving overdue video tapes from neighbors in New Eridu, choosing which tapes to display in the store, and answering customers' questions about movie recommendations. Random Play is an oddly nostalgic and charming store that brings me back to the days before Netflix and other digital streaming services pushed physical rental spots out."
"This old-school vibe extends to certain menus and features as well. The video archive for rewatching old cutscenes is laid out like a shelf of old VCR tapes, each with unique cover art. The archive makes it possible to replay chapters in case you missed anything or want to see previous scenes again, unlike in Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail. Zenless Zone Zero goes a step further, giving you the freedom to experience entire story missions as many times as you'd like."
"The Random Play store is located in the first main hub, Sixth Street. And besides your managerial duties, you can also go buy and eat food for temporary combat buffs, and play mini-games at the local arcade, among other activities. These activities are nothing special, but they introduce you to several other stores and NPCs in the neighborhood that make the world feel lived in. You'll find a surprising number of unique-looking NPCs to interact with for side commissions if you take the time to walk around Sixth Street and the other small hubs, and you can even chat with Agents across the city who are just living their regular lives."
"The character designs are fun and fitting for the world. There are several factions that each house two or more unique Agents. You can tell which Agents belong to the same faction almost immediately thanks to their clothing or uniform, but the characters often still feel distinct in both style and personality. This 17-character launch roster contains a wolfman butler, a blue oni, an android, and even a giant talking bear wearing a gold chain (we love Ben Bigger in this house), just to list a few standout Agents. There's also a day/night cycle and Persona-style Social Link system that allows you to spend time with individual Agents and complete character-specific side quests to raise their Trust Level for rewards as time passes. It's nice to have another meaningful way to interact with your favorite characters outside of Story commissions, but the day/night cycle adds almost nothing to the experience other than an artificial timer that encourages you to open the Random Play store every morning and forces you to rest at the end of each day."
"On the character building side of things, you can grind for nearly all currency and level up materials in two places: the Hollow Investigative Association (HIA) and Hollow Zero. These materials are used to raise levels, level caps, skill power, and upgrade W-Engines and Disc Drives. W-Engines and Disc Drives are the main equipment in ZZZ. Both provide extra stat boosts, but the former also provides a single main buff effect, while the latter has two-piece and four-piece set buffs depending on how many you have equipped."
"The VR challenges in the HIA allow you to customize each scenario as you grind, giving you the option to pick enemy types, difficulty, and main rewards. This effectively limits the amount of RNG you have to deal with when looking to upgrade specific Agents on your roster."
"Eventually, you also gain access to Hollow Zero, the repeatable roguelike mode. Hollow Zero is similar to Star Rail's Simulated Universe, except instead of regular movement outside combat, you're stuck in TVs again. You collect buffs, strengthen your team, and make your way to the end of the Hollow to complete it. This is also where combat finally gets a bit more challenging because you can fight stronger bosses and customize your experience, just like in the HIA. And after Hollow Zero comes Shiyu Defense--a fully combat-focused mode with timed encounters that increase in difficulty like Genshin Impact's Spiral Abyss. This is everything you'd want from the combat, but it does take a while to reach this point."
"For gacha games that aren't based on established properties, I usually find one or two features or moments early on that really suck me in, whether it's appealing gameplay, amazing character designs, a forgiving pity system, or something else entirely. Genshin Impact has its vast open world complemented by deep lore, and Star Rail has its simple yet challenging turn-based combat mixed with sci-fi fantasy. Zenless Zone Zero's aesthetic is what grabs me, but I don't know if I've found the thing that persuades me to become a daily player who may even spend a little money. It feels like it should be the combat system, but the enemy encounters feel too basic and few in number as you progress naturally through the main storyline before unlocking Hollow Zero and Shiyu Defense. For the majority of the experience, I just enjoyed the retro-futuristic vibe while seeing the numbers get higher, as with any RPG."
"As the Switch moves into the twilight years of an especially lengthy lifespan, Nintendo has increasingly turned toward remasters of its back catalog to fill out the release calendar. This is the context for Luigi's Mansion 2 HD, a remastered version of a relatively recent 2013 release on 3DS. The sequel is a game that served as a sharpened, refined take on the ideas presented by the first Luigi's Mansion--and laid the groundwork for the even better Luigi's Mansion 3--so having access to that piece of the series' history untethered from the 3DS makes it feel that much more valuable. While the recency makes it feel less essential than some remasters of older classics like Metroid Prime or Super Mario RPG, it's still just as fun to solve puzzles, schlurp ghosts into your jerry-rigged vacuum cleaner, and enjoy some gentle scares along the way."
"The original Luigi's Mansion was a cute diversion-verging-on-tech-demo that helped cement Luigi's personality as Mario's skittish and reluctantly heroic brother. Drafted against his will to catch a bunch of ghosts, it was a kid-friendly take on Resident Evil by way of Ghostbusters--even down to the tank controls, puzzles, and interconnected mansion setting. Luigi's Mansion 2, by comparison, swaps out the single environment for a series of different buildings that all reside in one extremely haunted neighborhood called Evershade Valley. That gives the game a more disconnected, mission-based feeling than both its earlier and later entries, in exchange for environments that present very differently from each other and allow for the feeling of themed haunted houses: an ancient tomb, a creaky old snow lodge, and so on."
"The mission structure focused on single goals that take around 15-20 minutes to complete seems primed for portable play on 3DS--the game's original platform--and that gives Luigi's Mansion 2 a particular rhythm. It's easy to pick up and digest a stage or two at a time but harder to get lost in for long stretches of time without feeling like you're going through the same steps over and over. A typical mission has you exploring a particular section of the building you're investigating, usually needing to locate some MacGuffin to unlock a section, sucking up a few scattered ghosts, and taking part in at least one arena-style fight against several ghosts. Rinse, repeat."
"Luigi progressively gains access to three key pieces of equipment: the Poltergust, the Strobulb, and the Dark-Light Device. Nintendo games excel at filling their worlds with playful touches, and these tools are key to making the environment feel alive. Your Poltergust is mostly used for eliminating ghosts, but it can also suck up money, pull off fake wallpaper to reveal hidden passageways, spin fans, or impact the environment in a few other ways. The Strobulb stuns ghosts but also activates electronic buttons and switches. And the Dark-Light Device is mostly used to fish keys and other objects out of haunted paintings, but later is used for activities like tracking footprints from a ghostly ""Polterpup"" dog. Each of these pieces of gear also upgrades to be stronger and faster, but that progression is linear and you don't have any real control over which gear to prioritize. Still, as long as you're doing a little exploration you'll keep pace with the upgrades you need."
"The tank controls can take some getting used to, especially as ghosts circle around a corner and you need to rotate Luigi's body to point the Poltergust or Strobulb at them. The right stick controls the direction your tool is pointing, while the Poltergust, Strobulb, and Dark-Light Device are mapped to ZR, R, and L, respectively. You can freely point your tools with the right-stick, which makes the ""look up"" function of the X button an odd vestigial piece of the original 3DS controls. In addition to the standard tank controls, listed as Omnidirectional, there's a Horizontal option for movement that feels a little more natural, but it can still be difficult to get your bearings quickly."
"The 3DS origins have other odd holdovers as well. The overhead shots of each environment while selecting a mission look uniformly low-quality, which sticks out. Occasionally, objects will appear surprisingly jagged in ways that look unintentional despite the series' more spooky, angular aesthetic. Not all of the anachronistic artifacts are uninvited, though; Luigi communicates with a ""Dual Scream"" device, which is clearly just a clunky old first-gen Nintendo DS. It was already a silly visual gag in the original, but this many years removed, it's downright nostalgic."
"Luigi's Mansion 2 HD also still showcases a sparkling sense of personality and humor, especially with Luigi's animations. It's clear he's been roped into this ghost-catching gig against his will, and he doesn't really want to do it, but Professor E. Gadd barrels through his apparent objections. The ghosts themselves are often funny, too, engaging in slapstick antics, especially when you spy on them through a peephole or a crack in the wall. At one point, I peeked into a room and laughed to find that I was peering over a ghost's shoulder as he hovered over a toilet reading a newspaper."
"Speaking of Professor E. Gadd, I really can't stand his design. This isn't the fault of Luigi's Mansion 2 HD specifically--he looks largely the same as he did in the original and Luigi's Mansion 3. But it's just hard to look at a classic, iconic design like Luigi or a Boo next to this obnoxiously ugly design, which looks like a mad scientist crossed with a baby. Nintendo seems unfortunately married to E. Gadd as the impetus for Luigi's ghostly adventures, but that character's look has aged terribly."
"The vast majority of Luigi's Mansion 2 is fairly simple, with a good sense of pacing between solving basic puzzles and catching a few ghosts. I would only occasionally feel stumped when a puzzle solution wasn't apparent, but the game is usually reliable about at least pointing you in the right direction of which room you should be exploring next."
"Despite that, though, the combat difficulty ramps up severely at the end, especially in one particular stage that is a long gauntlet of enemy encounters. The combination of ghosts who are shielded against you in various ways, and others that surprise you and temporarily remove control, makes it much harder to manage. At this point more than any other, I keenly felt the lack of checkpoints. Since Luigi's Mansion 2 is designed around quick, digestible missions, checkpoints are basically non-existent--if you fail out a mission, you simply restart it from the beginning. Most of the time this is fine, but it feels much less fine when you're 95% done with a late-game mission and then fail out and need to start all over again."
"Like the 3DS version, the single-player campaign is augmented by the multiplayer Scarescraper mode, a series of randomized challenges that can be played through the Switch Online service. Up to four players can explore the map together from a handful of modes. Hunter Mode has you trying to eliminate a series of ghosts, for example, while Polterpup Mode has you tracking the pawprints of a roaming Polterpup to proceed."
"Despite being created for multiplayer, though, most of the time your best bet is splitting up and covering different rooms separately, so it doesn't feel all that different than a regular play session--just with randomized rooms that fit together like Lego pieces. Teamwork and coordination are a must for the post-match challenge, though, as Red Coins get scattered throughout the map and the timer is way too short to reasonably get them all yourself. Gathering all the Red Coins gets your team a post-stage bonus, so if you want to maximize your ghost-hunting abilities, the divide-and-conquer approach is essential. The power-ups are randomly doled out to a single player at a time, though, so one player may get better gear than the rest, and there doesn't appear to be any catch-up mechanism for players who miss out."
"You can take on these challenges in multiples of five, up to 25 stages at a time, and then completing those will unlock Endless mode. You could technically complete these missions with only one player, but it would be much harder and you almost certainly would miss out on power-ups, so it would probably get unreasonably difficult very fast. You can also take the coins earned in Scarescraper back into the single-player mode for upgrades. However, in a limited play session, I only earned 50 gold for a five-floor challenge, regardless of how much loot I actually collected. Given that the higher-end single-player upgrades end up costing tens of thousands of coins, you can't realistically expect to grind them out with the multiplayer mode. So the Scarescraper exists mostly just to have fun with your friends, not to make real game progression. To that end, it's low-impact and breezy, but unlikely to last more than a few play sessions."
"Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon on 3DS was a surprising revival for an unconventional game. Now that we've had Luigi's Mansion 3, the series has come more into its own, and the second game is neither the trailblazer nor the refined third entry. That makes Luigi's Mansion 2 HD an oddball--less essential than some other Switch remakes, but an interesting middle step in the development of Luigi's puzzle series, with its own charms and place in the series history."
"In The Rogue Prince of Persia, you play as the eldest of two princes, who has found himself stuck in a time loop. The Huns have invaded the prince's home city, utilizing a strange dark magic that has overwhelmed Persia's forces. Possessing a medallion that revives him in an oasis encampment just outside the city three days into the invasion every time he dies, the prince has to repeatedly fight his way through the Huns to reach their leader and kill him. While working his way through the various levels of the game, the prince will also run across allies and members of his family--some captured, others still fighting the Huns--whom he can aid by utilizing knowledge gleaned from multiple loops."
"The prince's investigations play out as a mind board with pictures of characters and notes that are connected with lines, hinting at what you might have to do next to proceed in the game. A note discovered in the Huns' camp reveals that an important individual has been captured by the game's first boss, for example, encouraging you to reach said boss to question them as to their identity. Some of these investigations require you to travel to specific areas in a certain order over the course of a single run--I once had to talk to someone in one of the two starting areas to grab a specific item, travel to another area to use said item, and then go onto a third location to see how the used item had affected the environment. Dying amid a run would reset the process, as the nature of the time loop would mean that I never spoke to the person in the first area in the first place."
"This structure makes The Rogue Prince of Persia far more approachable than it would be otherwise, as clearing the first two bosses to reach the palace at the center of the city is quite the challenge. Could you manage to do so on your very first run? Certainly. But such a feat is unlikely without acquiring a few upgrades and learning the ropes of the game and the bosses' patterns first. Connecting the threads of the mind board and crossing off these smaller goals are more feasible from the start, providing a means of achieving ""victory"" even when you lose. A half dozen or so runs into the game, I remember losing to the second boss again but just thinking, ""Sure, maybe I didn't beat this guy this time around, but I did manage to uncover who the first boss kidnapped and where I might be able to find them--let's go save him!"" I had lost but I still accomplished something, and that feeling made me want to jump right into another run and go again."
"The Rogue Prince of Persia has superb gameplay flow, too. Though it takes a run or two to grasp the basics, the movement of the prince's parkour and wall-running moves flow into an assortment of weapon attacks and combat moves, including a downward slam and dance-like dodge. Building on the mechanics of Dead Cells (a game that developer Evil Empire took over and continued to build on with post-launch expansions), The Rogue Prince of Persia feels like a spiritual successor--you start with a weak melee weapon and long-range tool but can find stronger options within each run. Each weapon comes with a unique ability, allowing you to approach the diverse assortment of enemies differently depending on what you're choosing to use. When I first started, I was partial to the heavy-hitting Tabar, a slow-hitting axe-like weapon that stuns targets. But as I continued to play, I gravitated towards the claw-like Bagh Nakh that could unleash a fast and deadly special attack every time an enemy was killed, and the shortsword Falcata that grew stronger with every kill so long as I didn't go longer than three seconds without killing someone."
"During each run, you can also find talismans that give special effects to the prince whenever certain criteria are met. One talisman heals the prince for every fast-travel point he comes across, for example, while another unleashes a cloud of poisonous gas every time he hits an enemy with a long-range attack. You can only equip up to four talismans at a time and each can upgrade adjacent ones to improve their effects--one talisman might improve only the talisman equipped to the left of it, for instance, while another may improve both talismans to its right. Once a talisman is slotted in, you can't change its position, encouraging you to think strategically in terms of which ones you equip and the positioning of those you do."
"There's a lot of variety when it comes to builds, both in terms of equipped weapons and talisman combinations. The weapons and talismans you find are lost with each death and the assortment of tools that you'll find in each run is randomized, encouraging you to adapt and plan your build on the fly. No weapon or talisman felt so bad that I considered it worthless, but in this stage of early access, it does feel like a few options stand out as clear-cut go-to options. I always felt a little bit more confident going into a run with the compound bow as opposed to the grappling hook, for instance, and the talismans that unleash resin to slow enemies don't feel as valuable as the ones that poison or burn enemies. Granted, that could just be my playstyle, but it does feel like The Rogue Prince of Persia needs a little tweaking here and there to bring its weaker-hitting weapons and talismans in line with the others."
"The Rogue Prince of Persia's characters also aren't narratively compelling in this early access state. Though the quests they provide create breadcrumbs that are fun to chase, they're enjoyable for how they provide short-term goals. From a storytelling standpoint, they aren't all that intriguing and that largely is from the uninteresting characters that provide them. No one is all that interesting in The Rogue Prince of Persia, and the story falls a little flat right now because of it."
"Conversely, the variety of locales and levels you visit have tremendous personality. Each incorporates its own unique color palette, environmental hurdles, and musical undertones. The Rogue Prince of Persia makes great use of color, with vibrant blues, purples, oranges, and yellows illuminating even the spookiest of locations with a mosaic of eye-popping expression. This is one of the best-looking games I've played all year. Though every level changes slightly each run, the general layout of each remains largely the same. This, along with the memorable colors, feeds into the game's narrative theme of knowledge being power by acquainting the prince (and thereby you, the player) with a better understanding of where to go and what to do run to run, like someone getting better at navigating a time loop. At the same time, the shifting nature of smaller details maintains the idea that the prince's memory (like ours) of each space is a little fluid--he can't remember the exact makeup of every spot and the placement of each individual enemy, but he's got a general idea of the major landmarks and pathways."
"The Rogue Prince of Persia currently ends before you can reach its (presumably) final area and confront the Hun leader holding the prince's city hostage. The mental narrative map is also incomplete, left on a cliffhanger part of the way through. So there's more of this game to see and play that could address my concerns with the story. Even unfinished, however, The Rogue Prince of Persia is a great roguelike that offers hours of enjoyable runs. Its beautiful level design and flow-like combat more than make up for the game's storytelling shortcomings and curate an experience that I'll eagerly jump back into once there's more of it to play."
"Though The Chinese Room has previously worked in the horror genre, I don't think of the team as primarily a horror-centric development studio. Rather, I've long felt its name is synonymous with sadness. The throughline spanning games like Dear Esther, Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, and even Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a feeling of melancholy, longing, or even tragedy. continues this run of depressing games, which I mean as a compliment. By leaning into the studio's forte, the game's memorable horrors become more affecting hardships."
"I've found it difficult to write about Still Wakes The Deep as I didn't want to spoil its best aspect--the monster at the root of it all, which isn't shown in any pre-launch materials. But then I discovered how the game has been advertised--""The Thing on an oil rig""--which seems to let me off the hook. As it turns out, that elevator pitch is exactly what this game is like. Blue-collar workers stranded with a creature of unknown origin is a classic horror premise--Alien's ""truckers in space"" is essentially this, too. The Chinese Room pulls from these genre titans to tell a story of its own and places it all in an especially uncommon setting."
"It's Christmas 1975. Aboard an oil rig near Scotland, Caz McLeary evades the personal problems awaiting him back on the mainland by joining his buddy and several others toiling away at sea. The game's early moments set the scene well, with large, intimidating human-made machinery creaking and bellowing amid a storm. Indoors, claustrophobic corridors are plastered in cautionary signage that reminds players of just how dangerous and oppressive an oil rig is--even without a monster showing up. Fulfilling any role in such an environment seems to merit copious hazard pay. As waves crash around the perimeter and rain-soaked ladders climb to platforms that feel more like thrill rides when you stand atop them, the game's message seems clear: This place is not safe, and humanity doesn't belong there."
"It's not long before the drill hits something, which the game dances around revealing for a time, like any well-paced horror would. Still being mindful of spoilers, I'll say that once the threat is revealed, Still Wakes The Deep takes a turn I thoroughly enjoyed. Though the game's scariest moments still ask you to crouch-walk into hiding spots, tactically plan every step, and do so without making noise the way countless other horror-adventure games have done, it's the form of the creature that adds a rare element to these otherwise familiar gameplay loops; what do you do when your pursuer isn't really bound to corridors made of doorways, stairs, and perpendicular hallways the way you are? What if they're not even bound to any particular shape?"
"It's this being's alien-like qualities that are so confounding and intimidating. They feel intelligent and exacting like the Xenomorph, yet still horrifically human, which combines to create a skin-crawling beast no horror fan should miss. At once, you may feel sad and scared at the sight of the creature, as The Chinese Room ensures the formerly familiar aspects are there, albeit now distorted and tortured, like someone who gets violent during an episode of night terrors. You know they don't mean it, and if they could wake, they'd apologize profusely. But for the moment, they're trapped, so all you can do is escape their reach."
"The creature's physical appearance isn't always as well supported by how moments play out, however. I didn't mind there sometimes being long stretches in which I wasn't pursued--horror doesn't work if it's one-note, after all. Still, the game's most pulse-pounding moments were sometimes too easy to survive. Without a health bar, encounters are ruled by one-hit-kills. You're either successful or dead. The in-between moments, like narrowly evading the monster to just barely close the door behind you, are scripted. This doesn't leave room for more organically close calls. I never experienced any such moments, and I wish I did."
"Furthermore, the creature seems unable to search inside hiding places, leaving you feeling totally safe except for when you move from one vent or table to another. Even flashlights don't seem to stir the beast, which is fair enough if that's how they are to be characterized, but then there need to be other threats beyond simply being spotted or heard, and more ways to die than a pass/fail binary."
"Still, while the game as a whole doesn't scare me to the degree recent Amnesia games do--to draw a comparison to games much like this one--I found it thrilling enough and certainly unique that I'm sure it'll be a long time before memories of this monster leave my mind. Some of that is owed to the great soundtrack from Jason Graves, who is no stranger to the genre, having previously worked on things like Dead Space, The Dark Pictures Anthology, and Until Dawn. His approach here is reminiscent of The Chinese Room's past games, particularly Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, given it's often the sort of music that would sound pleasant in another context, but here it comes across as unnerving. Like the monster, Graves's score is noticeably human, yet obviously corrupted."
"Outside of the game's more direct hide-and-seek-like moments, it has you solving environmental puzzles and doing some light platforming--the former of which relies mostly on tension that, as mentioned, isn't always there, and the latter of which works surprisingly well in first-person. The game overuses the trope of marking pathway progress with the color yellow--yellow paint spills, yellow ladders, etc.--though an update is coming shortly after launch which will allow you to hide these visual hints."
"You'll also meet much of the crew early on, whether it's by chatting in the cafeteria or getting cursed out by Caz's boss. It's in the moments with the crew where the game shines brightly--second only to the introduction of the monster. The workers are Regular Joes, offering no keen abilities to help you through the nightmare scenario, just as Caz has little to offer them other than his innate impulse to survive. By learning who your co-workers are, it's all the more horrifying when many of them get plucked off one by one."
"Still Wakes The Deep is not a power fantasy, not even if seen through the point of view of its starring monster, as even there you'll find much anguish--too much to ever view the being as simply a mindless creature hellbent on destruction, that's for sure. It's Caz's own backstory, which drips out over the course of the six-hour game, that left me most affected, which is surely as intended. The manner in which he uprooted his life to join the rig crew is explored slowly during the game, and some supernatural elements are toyed with to drive home the overarching themes. As Caz, I desperately wanted to get back home, but the odds figuratively--and the rig literally--feel like they're perpetually collapsing around him, making his story a sad one whether he lives to tell the tale or not. Naturally, I'll not spoil that conclusion here."
"Suffice it to say, the game's final moments do well to bring its story all together. On the surface, and for a while, it's a pure survival tale of humanity versus the unknowable depths of the ocean, which may as well be another planet, I've long felt--and it seems The Chinese Room agrees. It works well even just on that level of being a simple creature feature. But as the game chips away at its characters' exteriors, which at first are as harsh as the setting, you come to see their true selves and remember why--beyond ingrained self-preservation--they are desperate to make it out alive."
"Though some tension is lost in the binary and sometimes simplistic encounters with the creature, its physical makeup, and behavior are the game's best aspects and rise to be deeply unsettling, if not terrifying. All of this makes Still Wakes The Deep a story that memorably tugs on your heart, starring a monster eager to tear it out."
"Late into Shadow of the Erdtree, Elden Ring's first and only DLC, I encountered something I'd never seen before in a From Software game. Nestled in a far corner of the Land of Shadow was a village untouched by the death, devastation, and decay left in the wake of Messmer The Impaler's bloody conquest. There, I watched trees sway gently as the wind swept through and marveled at the multicolored flowers spread across a field of lush green grass. The twilight of an overhanging moon met the golden rays of a life-giving tree towering above, creating a dream-like tranquility that was accentuated by soft, sorrowful music. No monsters lurked in the shadows and no threats awaited around corners; there was just beautiful, untarnished serenity."
"Shadow of the Erdtree takes players to the Land of Shadow, a place that has been hidden away, where the laws of the venerated Golden Order that governs The Lands Between were written in blood, and that has been forgotten and left to fester. Battling through the Land of Shadow's numerous castles, caves, and crypts delivers exactly what you want from a From Software game and what made Elden Ring an open-world masterpiece when it was released two years ago. It offers the same thrilling sense of player-empowered exploration and rewarding discovery, as well as the satisfaction of triumphing over adversity. These aspects of Elden Ring are all as potent in Shadow of the Erdtree, but it's the game's subversions that are the most striking."
"Shadow of the Erdtree is full of surprises, whether it's an unexpected moment of calm, a new gameplay twist, or a narrative revelation. The biggest of these, however, pertains to my expectations. I was ready for a modest-sized expansion to the world of Elden Ring akin to Bloodborne's The Old Hunters or Dark Souls 3's Ringed City. What I got, however, was a full-fledged, 30-hour game crafted by a team that is peerless when it comes to creating worlds that feel as dangerous and unnerving to be in as they are satisfying to conquer."
"Unsurprisingly, conquering the Land of Shadow isn't easy. Even if you've completed the base game and have spent hundreds of hours scouring the Lands Between for weapons, spells, and items while leveling up your Tarnished warrior, the Land of Shadow renews the sense of challenge by once again stacking the odds against you. Every battle in the DLC is hard-fought, with everything from roving mobs of soldiers and immortal skeletons to legendary warriors and beings from the outer reaches of the cosmos being deadly threats."
"This is because the DLC uses a distinct leveling system referred to as Shadow Realm blessings. Scadutree Fragments scattered around the Land of Shadow can be used at Sites of Grace to raise attack power and damage negation, while Revered Spirit Ash will do the same for Torrent, your spectral steed, and your Spirit Ash summons. There is a unique set of stats that only apply to your character while in the Land of Shadow, so all Tarnished will start on the back foot. But through careful exploration and by defeating notable enemies, you can gain the strength to stand your ground a bit more."
"Saying that the DLC makes the game hard again is a very obvious thing to point out, but the implication of it shouldn't be underestimated. After hundreds of hours in the Lands Between, a place designed to be unforgiving to the foul Tarnished in search of the Elden Ring, it feels more like home than an uncharted land of dangers. The Land of Shadow is a strong reminder of how intoxicating the feeling of fighting tooth and nail to survive is. In service of enhancing the glory of victory and the sting of defeat, From Software has outdone itself when it comes to enemy design and boss encounters. There are certain demonic denizens of the Land of Shadow who, even having completed the game, I'm not confident I could consistently defeat. Some move in a way that is unpredictable and erratic, making it difficult to find an opening to strike, while others simply tank your attacks and dish out retaliations threefold, ending your life in the blink of an eye."
"Bosses require careful observation and precise executions to best. Moreso than in the Lands Between, I found myself switching weapons and strategies frequently to meet the needs of the challenge I was facing. Early on, while fighting a particularly aggressive boss wielding two swords, I opted to add a shield with a parry ability to my build, allowing me to negate some of the damage and create opportunities to do damage. In another fight, I kept my opponent at arm's length by using a weapon that had longer reach, while also buffing myself using magic and items to make my attacks more deadly. Shadow of the Erdtree provides an excellent mix of bosses that will test your skill and understanding of encounters, and many are jaw-dropping spectacles that show off just how good From Software is at making weird and majestic creatures that make you feel fragile."
"The game doesn't make any drastic changes to the underlying gameplay mechanics beyond the upgrade system but does introduce a lot of variety through new weapons, magic spells, and items. A single playthrough isn't enough to get a good grasp on it all, given how many there are, but you're sure to find something new that'll introduce a fresh dynamic to combat strategies. I was particularly fond of the hand-to-hand combat options, and switched between the focused punches and kicks of the Dryleaf Arts and the ferocious Red Bear's Claw, which tears at the enemy with a flurry of strikes. Otherwise, Shadow of the Erdtree plays like Elden Ring, which is nothing to balk at given how refined its combat is."
"The real magic, however, is in the exploration, which leverages From Software's unrivaled skill at creating memorable worlds. The Lands Between has an impressive range of locations to adventure in--the vast fields of Limgrave, the magical Academy of Raya Lucaria, and the depths of the Siofra and Ainsel rivers, to name a few--but its key areas are all spread out across a significant landmass. The Land of Shadow manages to capture the same sense of scale but is more dense in its construction. This means you're moving from one memorable location to the next in quick succession, and each location has that handcrafted feel that you wouldn't expect from an open-world game; they have distinct color palettes, lighting, architecture, enemies and sounds, all of which come together to evoke a very particular mood and atmosphere."
"Three-Path Cross, one of the first locations you arrive in, is immediately identifiable as a place where significant life was lost. Graves stretch out as far as the eye can see, and gray, withered trees twist in on themselves, seemingly razed in a wave of fire. Pained violin notes and subtle but haunting operatic singing make it feel like you're in an afterlife of sorts--a cursed Valhalla. Another location changes the tone of the game to that of psychological horror, in which you're hunted by terrifying enemies that drive you to madness in seconds. It's dark and gray, with a fog so thick hanging above that light barely makes it through. It's a place that bears the signs of an Outer God's meddling and the spooky ambience makes every step forward tense. In yet another location, a blood-red sky pulses with the light of thunder, with severe and sharp mountain ranges piercing the sky, as if a colossal dragon is biting into the great unknown above. Without exaggeration, every single major location in Shadow of the Erdtree is awe-inspiring."
"The diversity of aesthetics and tones doesn't come at the cost of cohesion thanks to the way the Land of Shadow is layered and connected. Looping pathways and folding dungeons are a hallmark of From Software games, but in an open world, that's difficult to achieve outside of specific dungeons that are more isolated. While that moment of opening a door and finding yourself at the safety of a bonfire you were previously at are fewer and further in between, the satisfaction of them is more than matched in Shadow of Erdtree's feeling of following a route while not knowing where it leads, and then emerging into a vast new area. On more than a few occasions, I ventured down a ladder or off the beaten path and through a cave, only to emerge on the opposite side of the map."
"There's depth and breadth to the Land of Shadow; each time I stumbled into a new location, I felt a little smaller and the world felt a whole lot bigger. A couple of these moments involved doing things that are admittedly a bit obtuse, to the point that they may make reaching specific areas frustrating, but they can be figured out by taking it slow and connecting a few dots, which messages left by players should help with. There's a moment in Elden Ring when, after beating Godrick, The Grafted, you walk out onto a cliff overlooking Liurnia. I remember having an eye-widening, ""How big is this game?"" reaction to that; Shadow of the Erdtree is filled with moments just like that. In every sense of the word, it is sublime--a world that inspires admiration with the immensity of its scale."
"That scale is no less ambitious when it comes to narrative. As always, this is an area I will not describe in detail to preserve the experience for others. The basics, however, involve following in the footsteps of Miquella, an Empyrean who has seemingly abandoned the Golden Order, The Greater Will, and his mother, Queen Marika, in search of something else. This has taken him to the Land of Shadow, home of another child of Queen Marika: Messmer, The Impaler, and close behind him, other Tarnished have also gathered in the Land of Shadow to follow in Miquella's footsteps."
"The story that is told in Shadow of the Erdtree is additive to Elden Ring's overall narrative and fills in some conspicuous gaps in our understanding of the events that transpired. Miquella's Cross can be found throughout the lands and serves as a breadcrumb trail that leads to a very surprising conclusion. While the stakes are huge for Miquella, the smaller personal stories of the fellow Tarnished are also memorable. There are connections back to figures in the Lands Between and references to new concepts that make the lore much richer. Importantly, it's a story that still is purposely full of gaps, leaving the door open for speculation and interpretation from the community of avid lore hunters that From Software's games have cultivated."
"Elden Ring was a masterful open-world game that I would describe as generation-defining--it will go down in history as one of the all-time greats. But, when the final blow was struck in the Land of Shadow and my journey came to an end, I couldn't help but reflect on how it has made me feel and what has stuck with me. Yes, the moment-to-moment gameplay is thrilling, full of opportunities, and refined to near perfection, but it's the universe that From Software and George R. R. Martin have built, and the stories they've told within it, that I believe is their crowning achievement."
"With all that Shadow of the Erdtree offers to accompany what exists in the Lands Between, the story of Elden Ring now feels complete and its world whole, and it's a staggering achievement. It's dark fantasy done masterfully; rich in detail and intricate in its construction; a place that feels dangerous and cruel, filled with memorable characters, fascinating rules, mind-bending concepts, and competing ideologies. It's an achievement in world-building creativity that stands head-and-shoulders above the rest, with the closest comparison I can make being the late, great Kentaro Miura's Berserk. Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is From Software's victory lap, an unmissable tour de force that is every bit as brilliant as the original game."
"It's impossible to think about The Final Shape without the context of the last 10 years, the seven other Destiny 2 expansions, and the four original Destiny expansions--plus the vanilla campaigns that came with both games. This eighth Destiny 2 expansion is, to some degree, the culmination of the somewhat haphazard decade-long journey that the first game spawned, in which Bungie has continually tried experiment after experiment in gameplay, adjusted and recalibrated its storytelling, and worked and reworked its approach to running a live-service game. While the additions haven't always consistently built toward a story conclusion or a definitive vision of the game, there was a clear, mostly positive evolution across all those steps that informs what The Final Shape is to Destiny as a whole."
"I've noted in the past when expansions were high-water marks for Destiny 2 as a game, but this is something else. The Final Shape isn't just a step forward in a long march of progress, but, in every single way, a leap. Through its campaign, its new destination, its new activities, and its post-campaign story continuation, The Final Shape is as close as Destiny has ever gotten to the original promise of the game when Bungie first described a shared-world sci-fi fantasy shooter set in a far-flung future. This isn't just Destiny 2 as the best it's ever been--this is Destiny 2 as it always should have been."
"It all starts with a story campaign that tosses you into the Pale Heart of the Traveler in a bid to stop the Witness, Destiny 2's long-gestating ultimate villain, from using the game's convoluted physics-ignoring powers to rewrite reality. It's immediately apparent that developer Bungie has taken a different tack from how it usually approaches these chapters, with lessons learned from its consistently strong seasonal stories that usually spend more time dealing with the humanity of the characters than confusing sci-fi concepts."
A coherent and captivating campaign
"The Final Shape avoids past pitfalls by pulling together the best elements of all Destiny 2 stories, setting clear stakes and motivations for the antagonist, while keeping a tight focus on Destiny 2's main cast of characters as they head toward a likely suicidal, potentially world-ending confrontation. The Final Shape is easily the best story Destiny has ever told in an expansion, clearly laying out what is at stake and, at least emotionally, how it'll work, and setting players on a journey straight from point A to point B and a final confrontation with the Witness."
"A major benefit to that story, and the campaign in general, is the Pale Heart itself. Expansions always bring new destinations to Destiny 2, usually a new planet or moon with lots of cool places for events to happen, but the Pale Heart is inside the Traveler, the magic robot space god that's been at the center of this franchise for 10 years. Leaning hard into that magical side of the game, we get a location that's strange, familiar, uncanny, and often remarkable in its art direction."
"The idea is that the reality of the place is manifested from the memories and emotions of the people within it, creating meldings of familiar locations from throughout Destiny's history, but often recombined in strange ways or twisted by corruption. The Pale Heart is a gorgeous and fascinating place to explore, at once a heaven and hell of the Destiny universe. It leans all the way into the game's weirder side, which comprises some of the best elements of Destiny 2, and offers a ton of different places to fight, run, and climb, a variety that it uses to provide new gameplay scenarios and combat encounters that feel fresh and interesting, despite players doing more or less this exact thing for the last 10 years."
"The campaign combines many of the best elements from years of Destiny 2 gameplay to create a standout experience, especially on the challenging Legendary difficulty. First, it's the most mechanically intensive a campaign has been. Just about every big encounter has an extra layer to deal with, like toxic air that requires you to periodically zap a specific object while you stand next to it to gain a protective buff, or enemies that drop ""runes"" when they die that correspond to locked doors, requiring you to remember which pictures you saw earlier to activate the correct keys."
"The second major addition is an entire new enemy faction called the Dread, which adds several new enemy types to battles and rewrites the calculus of Destiny 2's firefights in significant ways. Destiny has added a few new enemies to its long-standing factions over the last few expansions, or changed slightly how a few of them operate to force you to adjust your tactics. Those are minor adjustments next to the kind of whole-cloth tactical alterations the Dread can bring to a fight, especially on higher difficulties. The most common and toughest of these wield powers that have mostly been the purview of the players up to now. They focus on debuffs that slow you down or freeze you in place, suspend you in the air so you can't maneuver for a few seconds, or grab you and yank you out of cover and into danger. Bungie put a lot of their focus for the Dread on messing with your positioning and flushing you out of safety, and it makes fighting these enemies fraught. They're a phenomenal addition to the combat landscape of Destiny 2, changing the makeup of fights in significant and surprising ways and supporting a bunch of new challenges."
"Level design in the campaign, and throughout the Pale Heart, is also generally strong, although Bungie has opted for smaller, tighter arenas than in the past that, at times, feel a bit constraining. These rooms feel like they're aimed at putting you closer to the Dread more often, making their area-denial and cover-flushing abilities more dangerous. But it can also feel like you're stuck shoulder-to-shoulder with an army, turning a firefight into a firing squad. Speed and movement are as much a part of Destiny 2's shooter DNA as gunplay, and while smaller battlefields can test players in different and interesting ways compared to open ones, the string of them in the Legendary campaign starts to constrict some of the best and most fun elements of Destiny 2's battles."
"The final major addition The Final Shape brings is Prismatic, a new subclass for players to use. Where the last two subclasses had specific focuses--Stasis was about slowing, freezing, and shattering enemies, and Strand was about tying, suspending, and shredding them--Prismatic gives you a slate of options drawn from each of the other subclasses, so you can combine abilities to make new synergies. It's not quite as drastically new or exciting as Strand was when it was fully unlocked in the last expansion, but recombining the lego blocks of Destiny 2's different powers and abilities feels great when you get the right mix of abilities, guns, and armor working together for peak build efficiency."
"Bungie has been improving its subclass abilities for a long while now, increasing the ways they're distinct and unique in their gameplay styles and uses, so fitting all those pieces together in different ways genuinely leads to some clever and creative new opportunities. There are already a lot of great tools to play with in Destiny 2's sandbox. Prismatic doesn't drastically change it up--The Final Shape adds some new Super abilities you can use with it, alongside new perks for buildcrafting and Transcendence, the new ""mini-super"" that gives you a cool new grenade to use and some other more minor benefits--but just getting access to mixtures like freezing your opponents, setting them on fire, and closing the distance with an electrified speed boost is an excellent way to create exciting new moments."
""
""
"Most importantly, though, Bungie trusts its own worldbuilding and its audience with The Final Shape in a way it usually doesn't with expansions. It expects you to either know enough about these characters to follow along or to pick up the dynamics from context. Importantly, though, the campaign is willing to just stop between missions and take a moment, using cutscenes, monologues, or conversations by a campfire, and push that characterization to the forefront. These elements have always been here, but they previously required you to do the homework of reading flavor text on weapons or digging into in-game lore books, and thus always felt like things that would be really good if Bungie actually put them in the game."
"The focus on character-building continues even after the campaign, into additional story missions and activities that send you out into the Pale Heart to explore. As it happens, some of the most interesting and affecting story moments happen after the campaign, but Bungie doesn't turn down the quality in any of these missions. Some hint at specific new threats or create additional mysteries that have to do with longtime antagonists such as Savathun, but they all utilize Destiny 2's characters in particular ways. Leading up to The Final Shape's raid, Salvation's Edge, you work through individual stories with your most important allies that do even more to flesh out their positions and their personalities. It's all as rewarding from a story standpoint as it is fun to play through."
"And a lot of it is extremely fun to play through. The Pale Heart is a phenomenal location thanks to its variety, but it also uses Destiny 2's long-time ambient public activities and marauding groups of enemies in smart new ways. Like the campaign, there's a huge emphasis on additional puzzles and mechanics everywhere in the Pale Heart. The biggest areas of the location include a specific activity called Overthrow, which is a multi-stage, escalating battle against enemy forces that consists of a bunch of smaller, objective-based activities. There are a ton of these, and they're all different from one another and specific to both the area and the ""level"" of Overthrow you're currently working on, advancing in difficulty as you complete them. Each requires a different combat approach or a different objective focus, making it feel like Overthrow is a combination of 10 or 15 public events played in quick succession. Overthrow defaults to being an event you take on alone, but while it feels like a public event, it works just as well with a team or solo--there aren't any elements that less knowledgeable teammates can mess up for you, and the density of elements makes Overthrow fun alone or in a group. It's a highly engaging and highly rewarding activity that's so varied that it's a blast to play through even over and over again."
"The extra mechanical focus throughout the expansion also translates into a bigger emphasis on cooperation than Destiny has ever worked into its lower-level activities. Once you work through the hidden secrets of the Pale Heart, you can access Dual Destiny, a special Exotic mission that's played only with two players--you can't access it alone, and it can't be done with a usual fireteam of three. Dual Destiny is awesome, maybe the best single mission in Destiny 2 ever. It's tough and full of smart puzzles, requiring the kind of communication and teamwork Destiny 2 usually reserves for three-player dungeons or six-player raids. Playing it felt like hitting a Destiny raid for the first time, what I previously thought was a singular experience. To say anything more would be to ruin a phenomenal, unexpected experience that I absolutely loved, and which has secured a place in my personal pantheon of great video game moments."
""
"There are a few other unexpectedly great bits, as well. There's not much fanfare for it, but The Final Shape includes a few campaign missions available with ""Cooperative Focus,"" which changes up the experience by adding tougher mechanics that, again, borrow from the best instincts of the raids and dungeons. These aren't just campaign missions that are scaled to be more difficult to accommodate three players; they have added elements that require teamwork and communication, like enemies that can't be killed unless attacked from two different sides simultaneously, or a debuff that will kill you if your teammate doesn't take it from you at the last second--then dooming themselves to death if someone else doesn't intervene. It's a series of fun and challenging additions that lean on all the best elements of Destiny 2, and like Dual Destiny, perhaps the best part is the unexpected discovery of these excellent design changes."
A satisfying shape
"Finally, there's The Final Shape's raid, Salvation's Edge. While some raids are better than others, in my estimation, there's never been a bad one, and Salvation's Edge is another in that long tradition of great gameplay experiences. Demanding a high degree of cooperation and communication from its six-player teams, it's just a blast, with some smart (if head-scratching) new mechanics, tough fights, and beautiful, weirdo locations that outdo even the already impressive art direction of the Pale Heart. Salvation's Edge is also a fair bit longer than most raids have been of late, which is nice for those high-level players who raid every week and are looking for a greater degree of challenge."
"It's fun, in other words, and while Destiny 2 players have come to expect a lot from Bungie's raid team, the gameplay depth on display makes even Salvation's Edge a surprise for just how good it can be. I don't think it's necessarily my favorite raid, but it's a properly solid, exciting, and intense culmination of the story. Bungie nailed making the final confrontation with the Witness feel like the massive, complex, and dangerous battle with a near-god that the story demanded."
""
"An excellent and extremely fun addition, however, was making the final culmination of that battle a special mission called Excision--the game's first 12-player PvE activity, accessible even by players who haven't finished the raid. The mission gives an appropriately over-the-top feel to the climax of the story, with 12 players providing the ludicrous scope it deserves, but which doesn't require being the kind of person who raids in order to fully experience it. Excision is its own kind of unique, surprising moment in an expansion that has turned out to be absolutely full of them."
"Even little things like the user interface is improved with the new Pathfinder system, making tracking everything happening in-game or completing regular MMO tasks easier to understand. The game now includes fewer currencies and offers more clarity on objectives, and a lot of things that were previously scattered around or hidden behind different activities have been added to vendor menus to make tracking and completing them simpler."
"Apart from a few tiny quibbles about little things like arena sizes, this truly feels like what Destiny 2 has always been trying to be. The Final Shape takes everything that's good about Destiny, from great combat design and inventive enemies, to puzzles and platforming, to creative encounters and fun abilities, to cool worldbuilding and excellent art direction, and brings them all together in ways the game has generally struggled to in the past. It centers its best characters in the campaign and gives you a reason to care about this war they're waging and what it's doing to them."
"The 2024 Formula One season is finally heating up. Max Verstappen will probably still win a fourth successive driver's championship after the final race in December, but at least the rest of the field is making life more taxing for the dominant Dutchman and his Red Bull team. Recent races have been more competitive and unpredictable, with multiple teams battling for first place in any given race weekend. It should be the perfect time for F1 24 to launch, but the same excitement generated by the real-life product doesn't quite apply to Codemaster's latest. It's still an excellent racing game, especially when you factor in an overhauled Driver Career mode, but its overt familiarity means there are fewer reasons than ever to upgrade if you own F1 23."
"F1 24's most significant selling point is its new, reworked Driver Career mode. You can still play through this multi-season experience as a custom driver, but F1 24 now lets you strap into the helmet of one of the 20 superstar drivers on this season's grid. You may want to try and win Verstappen's fourth successive championship yourself or pick a younger driver like Yuki Tsunoda and earn your way onto one of the bigger teams in the sport. Not only this, but you can also opt to start as an F2 driver--beginning your career in either F2 or F1--and choose from a selection of legendary icons like Aryton Senna, Jacques Villeneuve, and errr… Pastor Maldonado. This isn't just a cosmetic change, either, because all previous stats and accolades carry over, including the number of successful podiums, race wins, championship victories, and so on. It's an enticing prospect being able to potentially win Michael Schumacher's record eighth world title or attempt to rebuild Williams back into a title contender with Senna behind the wheel."
"Your driver's reputation within the sport will grow as you achieve top-10 finishes, complete contract targets, and tick off more accolades. This can help you secure a new deal with your current team or attract the attention of rival teams, who will then start vying for your services. If this happens, you can agree to attend a secret meeting and negotiate a move or turn down the offer, with the whole thing emulating the sort of behind-closed-doors nature of sudden driver moves that occur in real life. If you opt to stay with your current team, they'll be pleased with your decision. This is nonsensical considering the meeting was supposed to be secret, but these covert rendezvous are a nice new addition nonetheless."
"Mid-race objectives don't work quite as well, despite being a solid idea on paper. The tasks you're given are somewhat contextual but still disregard crucial information to the point where they add little value. It makes sense for your race engineer to ask you to set faster lap times if you've recently fallen off the pace, but not when the reason you slowed down is because you pitted or were stuck behind the safety car for a few laps. Obviously my pace took a nosedive when I spent 25 seconds in the pits--that's how it works. Rather than adding impetus to specific phases of a race, most of these mid-race objectives are too arbitrary to ever be engaging. There isn't even a noticeable punishment for failing, which feels like an admission that this feature isn't quite ready yet."
"What is ready are various enhancements to particular tracks that bring them in line with their real-life counterparts. Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, for instance, has undergone significant changes, notably around the course's iconic Eau Rogue/Radillion section, with an updated run-off area, a new grandstand, and trackside artwork. Silverstone has also been improved to enhance its accuracy, factoring in elevation changes and the track's bumps and grooves, while Lusail International and Jeddah Corniche have both undergone visual updates."
"If you choose to play as a current F1 driver, one of the other new features you'll experience is the inclusion of authentic radio chatter. Each driver has a plethora of audio samples taken from actual F1 radio communication. However, the utilization of these sound bites is sadly limited. You'll hear a line or two after crossing the finish line--with elated moments from certain drivers now repurposed to fit podium finishes and race victories--and they'll express dismay after a session-ending crash. Each driver remains deathly silent the rest of the time, though, refusing to respond to the race engineer or react to any other minor collisions. Again, it's a solid idea for a feature, but one where the execution could be better."
"It's a similar situation with the new Challenge Career mode, which offers a truncated and episodic version of the usual 24-race season. Here, you play as a predetermined driver and compete against other players asynchronously for leaderboard placement within a particular timeframe. The current event--which runs throughout June--focuses on Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, with the first episode tasking players with competing in races across Australia, China, and Miami."
"Though it's billed as a bite-sized mode, you still participate in a full practice session before one-shot qualifying and a short five-lap race. R&D upgrades also function the same way they do in the regular career mode, so you'll typically want to complete each practice objective to earn as many upgrade points as possible. This does also mean that upgrades can sometimes fail, putting you at a disadvantage against players with successful developments. You can replay an episode as often as you like to try and achieve a higher score and bypass these random failures, but that's a lot of time to dedicate to a mode where the rewards are a measly selection of bad-looking car liveries, helmet designs, and gloves."
"The scoring system is also convoluted in how it rewards overtakes above all else. Currently, the best way to achieve a high score is by qualifying in first place and then replacing all of your engine parts to accrue a grid penalty. This puts you in last place to begin the race, where you can then work your way back up to P1 and attain as many points as possible. It's a backward way to play and the mode is too much of a time-sink to even act as a viable companion to the regular Driver Career mode."
"In terms of F1 24's other offerings, My Team--where you play as a team boss, signing drivers and managing team finances--has remained identical to last year's game. Multiplayer is also much the same, aside from ranked races being reduced from 25% of a full race to only five laps' worth. F1 World is back as well, offering quick race events and a grind for car upgrades if you care about earning various cosmetics. I'm not particularly interested in unlocking an official Puma shirt to wear in a game where you spend 98% of the time looking at tarmac, so F1 World continues to feel like little more than a vehicle for microtransactions. The Drive to Survive-inspired Braking Point is also absent this year. Codemasters' take on a story mode has only appeared in every other F1 game since debuting in 2021, so the potential next installment won't arrive until at least F1 25."
"With this scarcity of new modes, EA has been touting Dynamic Handling as F1 24's standout new feature. It's a complete overhaul of the game's handling model, aiming to produce a realistic experience by making myriad changes to things like suspension kinematics and tire models. Initially, however, these changes were met with a wave of negative feedback, especially since they felt superfluous in the face of F1 23's terrific handling model. Since then, a major patch has been released to address many of the problems the player-base had issues with, and the end result is mostly positive."
"The front end of the car is still a tad too pointy, and curbs do almost nothing to dampen your speed, but at least the cars are now fun to whip around the track whether you're playing with a controller or wheel. There's a ton of downforce when taking fast corners that gives you an immense amount of grip, so there's a clear emphasis on driving aggressively and attacking certain sections of each track. This might make things a tad easier, and the cars are certainly more straightforward to tame this year, but it nails the feeling of being an accomplished F1 driver."
"The same patch that addressed the game's handling also improved F1 24's on-track AI. Other drivers are now prone to making mistakes, locking up on corners, and occasionally crashing into each other. Mechanical problems will sometimes force them to retire, too, adding some unpredictability to a race when the safety car or a red flag is introduced. The AI still isn't without its problems, however. They tend to bunch up, creating long trains of five or six cars where no one can overtake or break away from the pack because everyone has DRS. Being stuck behind these groups is frustrating, especially when the AI's straight-line speed tends to dwarf yours, no matter the car."
"F1 24 was riddled with other bugs at launch but has since improved by cleaning most of them up, yet one of the most egregious still remains. Sometimes, even amidst a torrential downpour, the game will refuse to let you use wet tires. The same is true for the AI, but they can still drive normally on slicks while you're left spinning in circles. Codemasters is aware of this issue, so hopefully it will be rectified soon, but up to this point, most wet races are simply unplayable."
"There are still a few more kinks to iron out, then, but regardless of these issues, F1 24's on-track action remains robust and engaging. The overhauled Driver Career mode is also a net positive, even if some of its ideas don't quite come off, yet an enduring sense of deja vu is present elsewhere. This makes F1 24 difficult to recommend if you've played any of the most recent games in the series. There aren't enough new ideas here, and modes like F1 World continue to disappoint by focusing on cosmetics in a game where your avatar is rarely seen. F1 24 is a terrific game in isolation, and the new Driver Career mode will be enough for some players, but it feels like another game hampered by the demands of its annual release schedule."
"The original Shin Megami Tensei V was great. When I reviewed it back in 2021, I loved the challenging combat, the excellent art design, the menagerie of mythological beings, and the overall dark and oppressive atmosphere wherein humanity hangs by a thread. But there was certainly room for improvement, so I was eager to see how Atlus would handle Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance, its revised and expanded multiplatform release. So rather than repeat what was said before--much of my original review still stands--it's more worthwhile to look at Vengeance's most important changes and new additions. There's a lot that's been added and adjusted, so let's focus on what made the biggest impact on the game overall."
"Perhaps the most noteworthy is its performance. Instead of being constrained on the Switch hardware, Vengeance is now multiplatform, allowing the game to run at a much smoother 60fps. Though the Switch version was known to chug when a lot was going on in its big, open environments or in combat, this is no longer a problem. (Since we've reviewed Vengeance on PS5, we can't say if the Switch version still has these performance hiccups, though we do know it aims to run at 30fps.)"
"Visually, however, Vengeance looks similar to the original; the environments and character models lack the sort of intricate detail you might be used to seeing on current-gen consoles. Still, what Vengeance lacks in ultra-detail it more than makes up for in stunning art design, filling the world with beautiful angels and goddesses, vile demonic hellspawn, and a blend of tarnished wastelands and mysterious, otherworldly constructs."
"One of the biggest additions to Vengeance is the titular Canon of Vengeance story path, which you can choose to follow at the game's earliest moments. (The original SMT V story, Canon of Creation, is still available if this is your first go-around in Da'at.) This take on the SMT V story introduces Yoko Hiromine, a student from a neighboring school who's trained in exorcism and harbors a grudge against her institution. You won't have to wait long to meet her, either, as she appears to help not long after your first mini-boss encounter with new demon Glasya-Labolas in the Tokyo ruins while also cleverly introducing the new guest-character combat element in the process."
"Yoko's not alone, either. The Vengeance story brings in a quartet of powerful female demons called the Qadištu who have their own objectives in the ongoing story struggle. Both the presence of Yoko and the Qadištu transform the narrative in unexpected ways. Not only are there additional story scenes and enemy encounters (which help alleviate the slow narrative pace of the original somewhat), but plot beats from the original storyline wind up getting twisted in new and interesting directions."
"It's exciting to see how things play out differently and how these changes reverberate in the story down the line, but even so, it takes a while for the Vengeance story to really diverge from the original. You're still going to the same places and pursuing similar objectives as the original canon for a good chunk of the game--not a big deal for newcomers, but a bit disappointing for returning players."
"The new guest mechanic also helps the presence of the other characters in SMT V's stories feel more important. Plot-essential characters will join your roster as guests for a certain stretch of the story, where they come with a large set of skills and can be summoned and removed from combat like demons. They don't take up any slots in your demon stock, can do things demons can't from the get-go (such as using items), and have a bigger skill selection. However, since they're story-dependent, they can come and go as the plot dictates, and they lack the customization options, such as stat-boosting incense and skill-bestowing essences, your demon units have. Still, in many combat situations, you'll be glad to have their extra utility around."
"If you're really into powering up your demon companions, the Demon Haunt that's newly accessible via leylines will be right up your alley. This is a special area where you can have a nice little chitchat with your demon buddies, usually about perfectly normal topics like how much fun it is to feel poison creep into the blood of your enemies or why it sucks that there aren't as many humans around to gut anymore. By bonding with your darling little army of sociopaths--through combat, conversation, and even gift-giving--individual demons might call you to the haunt to either give you gifts (like items and essences) or gain stat boosts and additional skills."
"You can also hang out with your human pals and your fusion-friend Aogami here and discuss plot-relevant happenings. The Demon Haunt certainly feels like an anomaly, with its cheery music and upbeat atmosphere amongst a bigger setting that is neither of those things, but it's also nice to have a place to take a break from the terrifying occult conflict happening all around you--and maybe get a little treat as a bonus."
"One of the defining features of SMT V was its massive, open-exploration environments, and a host of quality-of-life improvements in Vengeance has made navigating a much more engaging and enjoyable experience. The in-game maps are much more detailed than in the original, and a simple button press gives you a bird's-eye view of the nearby area, allowing you to better judge the topography. If you played the original, you no doubt experienced the pain of seeing something of interest indicated on the map but not knowing how high up (and often inaccessible from your current position) it was, so these tweaks are a huge help. Also aiding in ease of navigation are the Magetsu Rails: shortcuts that can zip you from one area to another quickly (and back again) once activated. These are most often found in out-of-the-way areas like cliffs, enclaves, and rooftops, reducing the amount of finicky platforming needed when backtracking to previously explored areas (and letting you do sick-looking Jet Set Radio grinds to boot)."
"Demon NPC companions that find items and areas of interest on the map can now be recruited and used outside of set story events, letting you find lots of random loot drops scattered all over the big areas. Finally--and most notably--you can now save almost anywhere rather than at set save points."
"There's a lot more worth mentioning: More Miracles are available to augment the Nahobino (and you can toggle many of them on and off as you please after acquisition), a whole bunch of new demons have been added to the roster, there's a mess of new side quests--including interesting little mini-adventures where you take control of a demon and time-limited trials--and demons now have unique ""innate skills"" that affect everything from skill efficacy to making combat negotiations flow smooth."
"Magatsuhi skills have been upgraded dramatically, with both new skills added alongside special skills that require either specific demons or demons meeting certain conditions. Some of these skills are eyebrow-raising in just how good they are, as they can remove enemy Press Turns even in boss encounters, depriving foes of actions. In turn-based combat where strategy revolves around getting more turns and robbing the enemy of their actions, that's huge."
"And that's something odd about Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance: This game felt notably easier than the original. For both the original and Vengeance, I played through the game on the standard difficulty, and Vengeance felt less trying overall. I'm not sure how much of that perceived reduction in difficulty comes from my own experience with the original--knowing enemy weaknesses and where you'll encounter them gives you a significant leg up--but with the new innate skills, new Miracle buffs, new and extremely helpful Magatsuhi skills, getting extra items and boosts in the Demon Haunt, and the save-anywhere feature, Vengeance is generally nicer to the player. Whether that's a good or a bad thing is up to your tastes--and, keep in mind it's always very possible to get yourself absolutely wrecked in a random encounter that goes south quickly, so you still need to play wisely. For those of you who want a bloodbath, the absurd ""Godborn"" difficulty in New Game Plus will satisfy your need for struggle."
"Everything that made Shin Megami Tensei V such a memorable and engaging experience remains in Vengeance, just tweaked and massaged into an even better game. It's easier to connect to the narrative--having the other human characters in your party and engaging in small talk with them go a long way to making the events happening around them feel more impactful--and the various adjustments to navigation, combat, and demon-herding let you focus more on savoring the dark atmosphere and the strategies of battle. If you didn't enter the tunnel to the underworld the first time around, this is the perfect opportunity to do so--and if you're a veteran of the war for the throne, there's plenty here to bring you back."
"I don't believe in ""so bad, it's good."" If a movie is especially bad, I'd sooner not waste my time since I don't find especially bad movies interesting on any level. So I've not seen the cult budget horror movie Killer Klowns From Outer Space in probably 25 years, when I was a horror-loving kid who didn't yet know he didn't like ""so bad, it's good."" That means I initially wasn't excited about a game based on this movie, despite my appreciation for the burgeoning asymmetrical horror multiplayer genre. As it turns out, Killer Klowns is a surprisingly nuanced PvP horror game with enough sugary silliness to not be taken too seriously. Rather than ""so bad, it's good,"" it's simply good."
"Killer Klowns follows games like Dead By Daylight, Friday The 13th, and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, pitting players versus players in a familiar horror landscape. In the case of this game, players are split into lobbies of three murderous klowns versus seven survivors trying to outlast them and escape the map within a 15-minute time limit. Though each asymmetrical horror game has carved its own path, Killer Klowns actually looks and plays much like Illfonic's Jason Voorhees game, which I find to be only a good thing. It's not a clone, but where it's similar, it's welcome, and where it's different, it usually works out, too."
"Survivors will need to scrounge for tools like melee weapons and health kits while, more importantly, locating and activating one of several exits across one of multiple sprawling maps, each of them built with intricate shortcuts to discover and routes to learn so that a skilled survivor can get some distance between themself and the squeaky shoes of a klown on their heels. Meanwhile, the klowns are tasked with patrolling the map and killing all humans, either by directly attacking them or hanging them up as human-sized cotton-candy cocoons until they wither away."
"This format means victory and defeat aren't all that important, really, as the klowns may kill several survivors while others escape and the final tally may award one side or the other what's called a ""modest"" or even ""poor"" victory. Sure, a perfect victory can be achieved, but in my 15 hours with the game, the community has not seemed too invested in this, which is actually a nice change of tone from the ultra-competitive Dead By Daylight. Survivors surely want to escape, but I found because the rounds are so unpredictable and yet the stakes never so high--I'm being chased by a goofy klown, after all, not Leatherface or Jason--it remains fun even in defeat."
"I owe that consistent fun to many facets of the game. Chiefly, it's a joy to run and hide from these cartoonish villains. Ducking into the thick bushes or a dumpster, peeking out as pursuers pass by, is thrilling time after time. And though the melee mechanics can feel janky and button-mashy, it works that way for both sides, so it's funny to get into a close-quarters brawl with a klown and maybe even live to tell the tale."
"When klowns are defeated, they're sent to a respawn screen that takes about 45 seconds to get them back into the game, so it also pays to be an aggressive player--or simply a group of players sticking together. You can clear the map of one or more klowns for a limited time and make lots of progress with in-game tasks, such as finding gas, spark plugs, key cards, and destroying cotton-candy barriers that are lining each exit, some of which may have been fortified by the klowns mid-game."
"One thing I don't enjoy is the game's movement speed, or perhaps it's really an issue with the animations. Playing as a human, I can crouch-walk to make no noise, walk to make a little noise, or sprint to make a lot of noise. Because the walk speed seems so slow, I find myself consistently wanting to run, but knowing it isn't smart to do so leaves me walking through a situation that, in real life, would at least have me speed-walking or jogging. I think even just changing the walk animation to a slow jog would psychologically feel better, as instead what players are left with just looks too lackadaisical for what the game affectionately calls the Klownpocalypse."
"On the other hand, one of the game's best innovations is how it treats you after you die or escape as a survivor. Rather than sit idly as a round takes perhaps another 10 minutes to finish, you can opt into quick-time-event minigames that reward you with items you can then bestow to allies still trying to escape--dropping them directly into their inventory like a gift from an unseen benefactor, or you can pocket them for yourself in case a survivor is able to use the single-use respawn machine that brings back all dead humans."
"This is a great addition not just to the game, but the genre, as it solves the oft-seen issue of having died or escaped sooner than your allies and then, typically just… sitting there. It wouldn't always work, but the Killer Klowns IP allows for your gifted items to magically appear in front of players, and it's all handled with a fun tone and colorful visuals that all scream ""video-game arcade circa 1988."""
"Playing as a klown is a lot like playing Jason in Illfonic's earlier effort. You're equipped with multiple abilities, some of which are unique to certain classes, and each of them on cooldowns, as well as weapons such as a cotton candy-ray gun that traps survivors, a popcorn shotgun that causes its targets to make noise for a short while, and a giant mallet (of course) that is used for up-close bludgeoning, among others. Like the humans, it benefits the team of klowns to work together and have a plan, because a few feisty humans can pick off a solo klown like a roaming band of thugs with baseball bats heat-seeking for red noses. Maps feel bigger in Killer Klowns than they did in Friday The 13th, so the tripling of enemies doesn't feel disruptive but rather spot-on."
"Whatever team you're on, there's a ton to learn and the game does a poor job of explaining these things. The tutorial is limited to text and static images on the main menu, and though it includes some tips that go beyond the surface level, none of it really compares to how helpful playing a live demonstration would be. This makes the initial learning curve pretty steep, as you may not well understand what purpose the game's many different items serve. Early on, I found myself existing as mere klown bait at times. It's fun to get better at the game and start to see strategies emerge for both teams, but the starting point feels hostile to new players, even if they were playing similar games before."
"The game has also been a bit rough out of the gate. Besides the janky melee combat, the in-game challenges are in the process of being reset due to an unspecified problem on the backend, which will remove anyone's progress on challenges they've not already completed. It's not a great first impression to offer players a limited tutorial and reset some of their in-game progress days after they paid extra to play the game earlier than most, but hopefully it's a short-lived hiccup."
"A more lasting concern may be parts of the metagame. On one hand, the slow but steady unlock of new cosmetics and weapons is par for the course and makes for fun new rewards to chase. But strangely, character builds are also locked behind levels, meaning a lobby of 10 new players will only feature two different builds--the three klowns as their starter build, and the seven humans as the starter build on that side."
"Given that each human is sort of a visual blank slate--in classic '80s fashion, I can make them a jock, a nerd, the popular girl, and so on--it feels unnecessarily restrictive to force them into stat silos in which they share the same stamina, strength, and other attributes until you level up, with the last of these not unlocking until you reach level 42 for humans and 50 for klowns. Whereas the janky combat and lack of a tutorial feel more forgivable, arguably even charming at times, the game's way of locking me out of tuning my build is harder for me to make sense of. In Friday The 13th, the game this is most like, human characters had unique starting builds and were available right away, which meant more diversity in play styles in any given round. Here, the game has stripped away that diversity, and I can't see how it helps."
"Maps feel bigger in Killer Klowns than they did in Friday The 13th, so the tripling of enemies doesn't feel disruptive but rather spot-on."
"Still, the game survives even this detriment since it never feels as sweaty or competitive as some other games in this genre. It's as though its shortcomings are both not so numerous or severe, but also made more digestible since the game is reliably a good time. Regardless of which map I load into or which team I'm randomly assigned to, I have come to expect something interesting and even hilarious to occur with each round."
"The game has a great sense of humor, like allowing for chaotic proximity chat and muffling the voices of anyone cocooned in cotton candy. The Klowntalities--kill animations shown when you eliminate downed players--include sights such as a pizza-delivery trap, a carnival-style mallet game, and a scene in which the klown grows to be a giant and crushes the human. These things are rarely graphic, so while it's tense, it's not really scary, and more often quite funny. Running for my life from a seven-foot klown with blue hair and squeaky shoes is such a goofy but joyous subversion of this genre's usual touchstones."
"Killer Klowns feels like it should have a steeper hill to climb than some of its counterparts. While other asymmetrical horror games benefit from iconic killers at their centers, this cult-classic '80s movie-turned-game doesn't have the same brand recognition--did anyone think we'd get a game based on Killer Klowns before A Nightmare on Elm Street? But what it lacks in starring sadists, it makes up for with a tense but silly core of intricate maps, diverse weapons, and a more lax PvP atmosphere than the genre is known for. Issues with the metagame exist, and, like some of the team's past horror games, it's all a bit rough around the edges. But it's the game's fluorescent, squeaky heart that makes this a circus worth joining."
"XDefiant feels like an homage, and as such, doesn't offer anything we haven't already seen in the competitive shooter space before. It's a generic free-to-play shooter, mixing ingredients from games like Call of Duty and Overwatch to create an all-too-familiar broth. Being wildly unoriginal isn't a bad thing if the formula works, and in this case, it does, for the most part. But some of its disparate ideas don't quite mesh, and this approach isn't enough to stand out in a crowded shooter market--especially when it delivers such a continuous sense of deja vu."
"Each of XDefiant's recognizable game types pits two teams of six players against one another. The action here is grounded, foregoing much of the fluid traversal present in many modern shooters by limiting your movement options and restricting where you can climb. Combat is fast-paced and twitchy, informed by a brief time-to-kill and rapid respawns; it's solid in much the same way CoD was circa 2011, featuring a smaller toolset and tighter focus on distinct weapons."
"These firearms consist of a familiar arsenal of modern submachine guns, shotguns, and so forth. Gunplay is satisfying, though, and each weapon feels unique, even within the same category. Take the AK-47 as an example: This long-standing Russian assault rifle packs a punch, but its violent recoil makes it slightly unwieldy compared to the more manageable M16A4 and its slower three-round burst. Picking a weapon and weighing up the pros and cons feels like a meaningful decision that gradually expands into dozens of smaller decisions as you attain numerous optics, rear grips, and modified barrels that alter various attributes. XDefiant's XP system fits within the same mold as CoD, allowing you to unlock new firearms, weapon attachments, and projectiles by killing enemies and completing various daily and weekly objectives. This also ties into a standard paid battle pass consisting of myriad cosmetics and XP boosts."
"XDefiant's combat isn't without its issues, however. Snipers are the dominant weapon of choice right now, purely because players barely flinch when sustaining damage. In a game with a time-to-kill that's short but still slightly longer than something like CoD, one-hit-kill weapons need to have more drawbacks. I can't count the number of times I pumped someone full of lead only to be shot dead by a single bullet because it's far too easy to line up a shot while under fire. Their slow reload and aim-down-sight speed put snipers in an otherwise good spot, but the lack of flinching disrupts the entire game's balance to the point where snipers are more effective shotguns than actual shotguns--which has the knock-on effect of making an entire category of weapons feel useless."
"While you're free to use any weapon loadout you like, XDefiant requires you to pick from one of four factions before every match (a fifth can be purchased or unlocked by accruing a hefty sum of XP). All four factions are taken from a different Ubisoft game, making XDefiant a sort of multiversal hero shooter. These are the Cleaners from The Division, Phantoms from Ghost Recon: Phantom (a free-to-play shooter that no longer exists), Libertad from Far Cry 6, and Echelon from the Splinter Cell series. Each faction has one of two abilities you can take into battle, along with a passive trait and a unique Ultra. The Cleaners, for instance, let you launch an airborne drone that douses the immediate area in fire, while their Ultra ability rewards you with a flamethrower to use for a short while. Each faction is distinct enough that they feel different to play as, and most of the abilities are fun to use, whether you're throwing down a revitalizing gas canister to heal your teammates at a crucial moment or charging at an opponent behind the relative safety of a tactical shield."
"Some factions are more popular than others, though, which does undermine the whole system somewhat. In my experience, players using the medic-based Libertad are few and far between, whereas Echelon players are prevalent in pretty much every match. This comes down to the strength and versatility of each ability. While most of the factions have abilities that are team-oriented or more situational, Echelons have the power to see enemies through walls, which is ceaselessly advantageous. There are no downsides to using it, so it's not surprising that most players do so. But this creates an imbalance where the other factions feel fairly pointless."
"The larger issue with abilities, however, is XDefiant's clash of styles. It wants to be both a fast-paced shooter and a tactical class-based shooter, but the former overrides the latter. When shootouts are over in a matter of seconds, there's no space to utilize an ability when a gun is quicker, more effective, and won't get you killed like preparing to throw a drone potentially will. Certain modes render some abilities more viable than others, such as unleashing the Phantom's deployable shield when defending a capture zone. But even then, maps are built around a combination of circular and three-lane design principles, ensuring that enemies are always coming at you from multiple directions with various flanking opportunities. Again, this makes for dramatic, intense, and fast-paced encounters, but it's not conducive to using anything other than your firearm in most situations."
"There are five game types on offer, and each is of the familiar objective-based variety. Escort mode is pulled straight from Overwatch, tasking one team with guiding a payload from one side of the map to the other while the other team attempts to stop them in their tracks. There's also Domination, which sees both teams compete for control of three capture points, while Occupy features a single point that periodically changes location throughout the match. This emphasis on capture-point modes eats into the game's variety and it doesn't take long for repetition to sink in. It's also a little disappointing that there isn't more innovation here, with none of the modes offering anything we haven't already seen before."
"Aside from being well-designed, the maps are visually pleasing, at least--each inspired by the same games as the four factions. Dumbo pulls a slice of snowy Manhattan straight out of The Division, mixing abandoned stores with wide streets and overturned yellow cabs. Nudleplex, meanwhile, is the colorful Silicon Valley campus from Watch Dogs 2, featuring offices connected by children's play slides and a centerpiece fountain, while Echelon HQ takes place in a sleek hi-tech office with air vents to crawl through and a spacious lobby built for histrionic firefights."
"Based on the strength of its maps and its great shooting mechanics, XDefiant enters the free-to-play shooter space in competent shape. Some of its balancing issues will hopefully be rectified soon, but even then, overpowered snipers are a relatively minor issue compared to its clumsy mishmash of styles. The pace of the action is at odds with its class-based approach, almost completely undermining its focus on unique character abilities. Combat is enjoyable enough that it's still eminently playable, and XDefiant's foundations are ripe for improvement. Competition is stiff, though, and there are better options out there that aren't as conflicted."
"In RKGK, you play as street artist-turned-rebel Valah, who is set on taking her city back from Mr. Buff, a rotund megalomaniac set on enslaving the populace with hypnotizing billboard screens and an army of robots. With spray paint cans in hand, Valah does battle with Mr. Buff's robotic minions in an assortment of third-person 3D platforming levels, returning to her home base between each mission to talk with her allies or switch outfits."
"Each level of RKGK is a self-contained gauntlet of shifting platforms, explosive traps, twisting rails, and breakable containers that Valah must double-jump over, dash past, grind through, or smash. Enemies populate each level but are easily overcome with a quick spray of Valah's paint--it's not all that challenging or rewarding to take them down. Some provide an additional challenge by shielding themselves or releasing area-of-effect attacks, but nothing that comes close to stopping Valah, even on the harder difficulty where she has less health."
"But the name of the game for each level is speed, not combat. Your performance for each level is graded, with completion time affecting the curve most of all--it's clear enemies are meant to be a speed bump, not a combat challenge. Chasing that faster time is the crux of RKGK, and it's delightful to replay levels in hopes of uncovering hidden shortcuts or figuring out faster ways to chain together enough platforming combos without Valah being hit to unlock a speed boost that rockets her forward. Deducing a new way in which to shave off a crucial handful of seconds to earn a better letter grade feels like a victory over the robotic minions in itself."
"Even RKGK's boss battles are structured around platforming, prioritizing Valah's positioning and timing until the boss opens itself up to an attack. It's not the most exciting way to take down the hulking constructs that impede Valah's way, however, which lessens the thrill of overcoming them--hiding behind an obstacle and waiting for the boss to stupidly ram into it for the third time just isn't as thrilling as performing a death-defying leap to shave some time off a level, for example."
"Valah's movements possess an exuberant sense of speed without sacrificing control--whenever I fell off a platform or missed a jump, the fault was mine. The build-up of the platforming challenges is a rewarding climb as well. As Valah continues through the game and reaches later levels, she encounters faster-moving platforms, flame-spouting traps, and increasingly obtrusive obstacles, but RKGK never piles on multiple new elements at a time. Instead, they are typically introduced in a vacuum, forcing you to contend with the new element one or two times, before then finding ways to weave it into aspects of level design you've encountered, subsequently remaking an old obstacle into a new challenge that you already have an inkling of how to overcome."
"This method of level design ensures RKGK has a steady momentum when it comes to progression. Even on the harder of the two difficulties, you're rarely stymied for long, allowing you to complete each level in a matter of minutes and move on to the next stage if you want. Every level hides secrets off the beaten path and a few contain a handful of shortcuts, incentivizing you to replay them to earn a higher grade and unlock more rewards, which can then be spent to buy cosmetics for Valah, like outfits and paint colors."
"This structure centered around replayability does help alleviate the shortcomings in RKGK's story, which is bland and shallow. Valah is not an easy protagonist to relate to, spouting quirky action-movie one-liners and wanting to stand up to the big bad but not really existing beyond those general characterizations. The story rushes through her battle with Mr. Buff, never quite delving into either character's motivations or rivalry in an intriguing way. Midway through the game, I had completely checked out of its story, solely incentivized to keep going to enjoy the well-designed levels and increasingly complex platforming challenges."
"The blandness of the narrative bleeds a little bit into the aesthetics of the levels, too. Though they are designed well and each presents a handful of obstacles and challenges unique to it, a huge swath of the levels that Valah parkours through all visually look the same. Presumably, this is to go along with Mr. Buff's motivations to make everything look as identical and lifeless as the robots he commands, but in practice, this translates into dozens of levels that all bleed together in my mind. This doesn't hurt the moment-to-moment of RKGK's gameplay but does impact the overall game's memorability and further detracts from the narrative elements of the world. It's hard to care about a world so same-y, and I wish Valah's efforts to clear each stage and remind the populace about their home city's uniqueness was translated into the game so that I could see it, too."
"You see a snippet of something like this whenever Valah happens across one of the hypnotic billboards in the world, which she can paint over for extra points if she's collected enough paint throughout the stage. When she does so, you're presented with beautiful works of art that pull inspiration from both Japanese anime and Mexico's graffiti culture, hinting at what type of world Valah did live in before it all became red and gray. They're always awe-inspiring to see, and Valah suddenly painting something new quickly became one of the things I most looked forward to while playing through each level. These instances are rare, however, hiding away one of the most stunning aspects of the game."
"RKGK / Rakugaki is a fun debut for Wabisabi Games, incorporating an incredible anime-inspired art style into an approachable 3D platformer. Same-y looking environments, disappointing boss battles, and a bland story all make it hard to connect to the narrative elements of the game, but the gameplay is sound and the level design is rewardingly challenging. Even though the story is forgettable, my desire to further master my timing and precision in my quest to get better and better completion times is, for now, continuing to bring me back."
"There's something timelessly scary about cornfields. Their impenetrable depth and intimidating height can quickly disorient anyone who stumbles into one, leaving them desperate to find an exit path, and turning a simple field of grain into the setting of a horror story. Villainous Games leans into this universal truth as the centerpiece of its folk horror game, Harvest Hunt. Pitted against a ceaseless monster hellbent on corrupting and consuming a village, it's the game's interlocking systems that make it worthwhile, even when the creature leaves something to be desired."
"In Harvest Hunt, you're tasked with amassing enough ambrosia over five-night-long runs to secure your village's immediate future. The deeper you get into a harvest season, the higher the requirements and tougher the tasks may become. The game leans into some light deck-building elements like so many similarly designed games have as of late, but these cards are varied enough--no matter if they're beneficial or detrimental--that they remain interesting after several hours of play."
"Played in first-person and presented with stylized visuals that borrow Rare's no-straight-lines approach paired with a rustic but comic-booky layer on top of it all, the mood is strong. A foreboding night sky hangs over the randomly generated farmlands, combining with the plethora of cornstalks, creaky footbridges, and uninviting ponds to form an initially intriguing whole. It's a world that makes you feel unwelcome and disoriented, adding a compelling creepiness to a game with a relatively simple gameplay loop."
"I only wished these randomly generated maps had more variable parts. Outside of the cornstalks and ponds, there are three key landmarks on each map, like a massive, gangly tree and a haunting windmill through which the moonlight so stylishly cuts. But these locales aren't supplemented with smaller, equally memorable sites to see from night to night, leaving me feeling like I'd seen it all before even though, at the same time, I couldn't possibly map the pathways. It's somehow dizzying and overly familiar at once."
"In spirit, I likened Harvest Hunt to Slender, the once-viral and simplistic horror game that randomly spawned journal pages across dizzying maps as a ceaseless monster nipped at your heels. Harvest Hunt builds interesting card mechanics on top of that, but its underlying substance is the same, or sometimes worse; the monster is restless, but unlike in Slender, they're also pretty easy to evade."
"The Devourer stands two or three times taller than the player character, with a peculiarly round shadowy body sporting green sores but not much else. Given their height, you can sometimes see them coming from a distance, and when you can't, there are ways of locating them, such as placing a weathervane that points toward the beast in real time. I was often able to crouch-walk very close to the Devourer without them spotting me, and when they did, I could sprint away and easily lose their tail more often than not. Worst of all, however, is what happens when they'd catch up: They'd grab me and immediately deplete a portion of my health, forcing me into a simple button-mashing minigame where I'd need to wiggle free to minimize the damage. Once I did squirm away, the game seemed to give me something like a cooldown where I could escape to hide again, resetting the creature's pursuit back to its unalerted state. All of this is to say, the Devourer isn't scary."
"This loop of dodging the monster while collecting enough supplies to meet a particular quota by run's end isn't unlike that which you'd see in the hilarious-but-scary horror du jour, Lethal Company, but Harvest Hunt is played entirely solo and serious, and it doesn't have the scares to make up for that difference. The game even wants you to consider harming the beast to transform fragments of their body into stockpiles of ambrosia, but they were consistently easy enough to dodge that I never saw the point. I always preferred playing stealthily and collecting the vital resource piece by piece. I appreciate the play-your-way approach in theory, but found one way was clearly better."
"So much necessarily hangs on a horror game's scare value that I was oddly still impressed with Harvest Hunt for being interesting even as its monstrous mascot isn't. Played as a horror game, it's moody but falls shy of its goals. Played as a roguelite first and foremost, however, it fares much better. This is mainly because the game's deck-building system offers consistently worthwhile obstacles and rewards. Each night of a five-night run, you're given a new random benefit and detriment, such as being able to damage the beast with fewer hits or turn healing items into additional ambrosia when at full health, but also suffering from effects like the Devourer's stationary ""fiends"" calling out your location more easily, or turning all waters, even small puddles, into toxic baths."
"I enjoyed the way these played off each other and altered my approach for each night. Though the maps felt insufficiently varied after the early hours and the monster never instilled the fear in me they were meant to, I nonetheless enjoyed trying to complete runs as they grew to be more oppressive with increasingly improbable quotas."
"As you sustain a run, you'll also pile on temporary bonuses, called strengths, night after night until a season ends, as well as longer-lasting village fortifications that really just translate into more strengths. Meanwhile, the Devourer enjoys a single, consistent feature each season, such as leaving a trail of toxic gas in their wake."
"Strengths and fortifications are selected from different intervals, and choosing any card over the others offered to me became hard since they were well-designed and would each make different aspects of a run easier, such as allowing me to crouch-walk faster versus expanding my hit point total each time I'd heal or making the act of healing a faster one. This gave me pause and forced me to consider builds to counter what else the harvest season was already throwing at me. I could also trade starting HP for tools around the map, which felt like an often risky trade-off that I'd nonetheless accept."
"These many overlapping and sometimes stacking effects ensured that in seven hours of play, I never explored the setting in the same way twice. I was often desperate to escape with my life and ambrosia not because of the monster, but because of these other hazards that would deplete my HP and bring me to the brink (or beyond) of total failure, thus resetting all of my progress."
"In Harvest Hunt, the stakes are real, but the scares aren't. There is tension in the game, but it doesn't rise to the heights it wants to due to a central villain who can't pull their weight. That places a figurative ceiling over its best moments, but it does have bright spots. I appreciate its rustic, askew art style and interlocking roguelite systems, which give me an objective worth hunting down in a folk-horror world that at least looks, and in some ways, plays, the part."
"My biggest concern--particularly after Microsoft purchased Ninja Theory--was that the next entry in the Hellblade series would aim to be one of the massive, AAA experiences that are taking over the games industry, complete with a cluttered mini-map, crafting, side quests, and more. That's not to say these features are inherently bad of course--they do have their place--but to me, this felt at odds with what Hellblade did so well. I didn't want breadth, I wanted the series to maintain its depth; I wanted emotion, art, storytelling, introspection, mythos, terror, and magic. In fact, I was so concerned that the studio would trade in its depth for breadth, I didn't foresee what actually happened."
"Rather than expanding its systems and scope, or weaving a story equal parts intimate and mystical, Senua's Sage: Hellblade 2 focuses on vastly improving what its predecessor already did so well: visuals and sound. Hellblade 2 is a marvel to look at. It's gorgeous, cinematic, and hyper-realistic, yet still eerie and ethereal. Its music remains extraordinary, and its sound design is primed to make your skin crawl. And yet, I cannot help but be disappointed by how pared down and shallow its story and gameplay are. While Hellblade 2 might be a sight to behold, its minimal gameplay and muddled narrative prevent it from being a game that has any meaningful impact on me."
"Senua's Saga picks up not long after Senua's Sacrifice, and follows our heroine as she sets off to confront the Northmen who keep raiding her lands and enslaving her people. She sees this not solely as a chance to do what's right, but as a way to atone for the sins she is still convinced she committed--a way to wash off the blood that she can't help but see on her hands. However, Senua soon discovers that vengeance is not so simple, and a decision that condemns and brutalizes one group could mean safety and survival to another."
"It's a simple plot that is ultimately executed in a way that lacks richness. Yet there are certain themes here that carry it a bit further. First and foremost--and as every therapist will tell you--progress is not linear. Exploring Senua's reintegration into society and how her mental illness impacts that process is an interesting concept. Despite her being in a better place by the end of the first game, she is not miraculously cured of her trauma or the inner voices that manifested as a result of it. In fact, she is still largely fearful of herself and plagued by the guilt her father instilled in her. I appreciate that this comes through in her newest journey, too."
"Additionally, Hellblade 2 hones in on compassion in a way that is not novel, but tender nevertheless. Between Senua's companions assuring her that her empathy and unique way of seeing the world is a gift, to the game's overall emphasis on trying to understand the ""man behind the monster"" in order to heal them and stop cycles of violence, there are some calls for kindness here that are always worth hearing. I appreciated the game presenting conflicting ideas on morality and reformation, and while it did frequently delve into the old saying ""hurt people hurt people,"" it also made clear that people always have a choice and that pain is not an excuse for cruelty."
"And yet, the themes fall a bit flat. I suspect it's largely due to the game's dialogue, narration, and Senua's voices, which never reach the same level of poeticism or introspection as they do in the first game. The voices in particular often come across as a distracting novelty. And sure, it can be argued that anxiety and trauma is distracting, but if that was the artistic choice Ninja Theory was going for, that sense of turbulence doesn't cut through. Instead, I was left frustrated that Senua's internal monologue became this simplistic bit of noise that only truly offered up either affirmations or self-flagellating remarks--some of which seemed to counteract all her previous lessons learned in a way that felt less like nonlinear progress and more like a lack of narrative cohesion."
"But while the voices felt too simple, the game's narration felt overly obtuse, featuring legions of words said all to convey very simple messages that are then repeated dramatically time and time again. All this comes on top of the fact that this game adds a cast of supporting characters who talk over and under these other voices, leading to writing coming across as muddled and tedious, and ultimately lacks the same sense of artistry exhibited in the Hellblade 2's audio and visuals. I also suspect that some of this would have been easier to forgive if the game's story beats were bolder, more intimate, less repetitive, and less predictable, but Senua's Saga ultimately commits to being an aesthetic and cinematic spectacle at the expense of telling a profound story that takes both Senua and the player to new heights."
"This is a problem that rears its head again when examining Hellblade 2's gameplay, which is substantially more frustrating than its storytelling. While playing through Senua's Saga, you will primarily do three things: walk, solve puzzles, and fight. In theory, that should be enough to make a player feel like they are playing a game--I mean heck, strip down Zelda and it's basically the same thing, right? Yet Hellblade 2 reached points where it felt more like I was watching a slightly interactive movie. The majority of my time felt spent crawling through caves or walking along beaches, and infrequent puzzles and simplistic combat kept me from feeling any sense of relief, connection, or satisfaction with the game."
"And sure, I've heard it argued that the original Hellblade's puzzles and combat were nothing extraordinary--I'd say that's fair, as the game primarily focused on deep, introspective storytelling. But considering Hellblade 2 doesn't have that, I had some hope new and improved mechanics might lie in store for us. Instead, things have been pared back. Just about every battle is the same: you face off against an enemy, parry their attack, press a button to kill them, then engage with the next one. Whereas in the previous game you had to navigate the field, manage multiple enemies, and could kick and fight a bit more dynamically, all of that has been cut in favor of circling around a single enemy until you can get in a parry."
"It's clear that the reason for this new combat system is to make battles more scripted and cinematic, as it's easy to incorporate tense moments, rolls, combos, dramatic deaths, and more when the player is limited to hitting a couple buttons against a single opponent in a very small space. But the big problem here--well, other than the combat itself--is that several games have proven that fights can feel choreographed and cinematic while allowing players to engage with enemies in more meaningful ways. Combat in Hellblade 2 feels not just like an afterthought, but virtually non-existent. In fact, I'd argue that the end result feels similar to a quick-time event, yet more tedious."
"Solving puzzles is just as simple a process, and mainly consists of finding ways to distort reality in order to gain access to new areas and vantage points. From there, you will find hidden runes that aid your progress. It's slightly less tedious, but none of the puzzles scattered throughout the game are particularly engaging or difficult, meaning you never feel challenged or particularly satisfied with yourself."
"This isn't to say Hellblade 2 is devoid of any remarkable features. In fact, you'd be hard-pressed to find a more visually striking first-party Xbox title. From its lighting and framing to the hyper-realism of its characters and locations, every bit of Hellblade 2 feels cinematic and spectacular. Whereas its story and systems could use some love, it is abundantly clear that these environments--from the animal skulls that adorn dilapidated houses to the towering mountains and vast oceans that extend past where the eye can see--were completely adored by the team. Similarly, the game's motion capture and performances are next-level, with each of the game's main cast bringing a level of melodrama and tension to the game that elevates a script that is otherwise a bit flat and predictable."
"The game's sound design and music are perhaps even more notable. Though the most obvious praise is leveled at the game's binaural audio, there are so many other elements that come together alongside this choice that elevate it. The deep groans of rotting buildings and shrieks of villagers in pain are so realistic they feel palpable. Senua's up-close and breathy panic inspires instant tension, while far off, guttural singing strikes fear. Though the combat itself might be subpar, the music that plays while Senua faces off against the draugr is intense and riveting."
"But while few games can rival Hellblade 2's sound, graphic fidelity, and talent for rendering stunning vistas and characters so expressive you can tell when they're tensing their jaws, I couldn't help thinking how gorgeous the game would be if what was depicted was more varied. There are a few memorable set pieces I won't spoil, but even compared to its predecessor--which led players through tombs, razed towns, haunted woods, chamber halls, and let them face off against giants, a rotting boar, towering stag-headed monsters, and the god of illusions--there is surprisingly little variation in Hellblade 2's settings and monsters. Though the caves Senua crawled through succeeded in inducing the claustrophobia the game warns you about at its start, large chunks of the game taking place surrounded by stone isn't entirely appealing. It's yet another substance problem in a game that is regrettably full of them."
"Just like the first game, Hades 2 has launched first in early access, allowing developer Supergiant Games to delicately tweak and balance gameplay, as well as add new content before its full launch. Hades 2, however, feels like a complete product right now. With satisfying combat that has far more depth than its predecessor ever managed, it raises the question: what’s left to refine? It's significantly larger than the first game too, with more areas to explore, different routes to take, and a much bigger story to tell. If it wasn't for its (currently) missing ending and a few placeholders here or there, Hades 2 could already emphatically be declared as a brilliant successor to one of the greatest rougelites out there. Hades 2 improves upon its predecessor in every way, making it a masterfully crafted sequel."
"Instead of playing as Zagreus again, you play as his sister Melinoe, who was born after the events of the first game. Her family has been lost to the underworld, after the titan Chronos usurps the throne and takes over Hades' domain. Melinoe, saved from the unknown fate of her family, has been raised to realize one simple goal: Death to Chronos. With the help of her mentor, fellow titan Hecate, and a cast of new and returning gods, shades, and all those in between, Hades 2 sets out strongly from the get go with a story that is gripping to watch unfold between runs."
"For all of its improvements, Hades 2 doesn't initially look or feel that different. Melinoe moves with the same speed and grace as her brother, albeit with some slight changes. Unlike Zagreus, Melinoe is far less dash happy, with a longer cooldown between each of her evasive bursts of speed that's initially awkward to get used to. This is offset by a greater emphasis on maintaining speed through sprinting, which you engage by holding down the dash button right after executing it. This sprint provides the same degree of damage-avoidance, but feeds into additional offensive options too. And some enemies are designed specifically to punish a reliance on just dashing to encourage a shift in mindset. This sprint can also be upgraded with boons in a similar fashion to your standard attacks, letting your sprint shock foes with Zeus' lighting, or knock back entire groups of them with the powerful waves of Poseidon. This tangible change is a taste of how Hades 2 approaches evolving a strong, established formula by making small, sometimes experimentative, changes that have a profound effect on the way you approach gameplay."
"Nowhere is this more evident than the expansion of Melinoe's offensive repertoire. She maintains the trio of options that her brother had with standard, special, and cast attacks; both the standard and special attacks are determined by your weapon selection before runs. This is already delightfully varied, with the starting Witch Staff offering a nice balance between safe ranged melee strikes, while others, such as the Sister Blades, demand a bolder approach since their limited range forces you to really get in the face of enemies before backing out to safety. Melinoe's cast is also far more involved than Zagreus' awkward red diamond projectile. In keeping with her witch abilities, Melinoe can throw down a circular ring that confines enemies inside it for a brief period of time, making it an effective crowd-controlling option at its default tier. Boons from the gods can radically evolve it though, letting you turn the defensive snare into a more offensive area of effect spell that decimates large groups of foes or inflicts harmful curses on them. These can also be combined with other boons that you have augmenting your standard weapons to create a deadly mixture of skills. Between the five currently available weapons and this new standard casting ability, Hades II already allows you to drastically differentiate your runs based on the equipment you choose before you start, keeping each one tactically engaging and satisfying to utilize."
"Where weapons were the sole differentiator to combat in Hades, its sequel layers on a whole new system to consider too. Melinoe has an all-new Omega attack available to her, which is available on top of your three combat abilities to further deepen the complexity of the entire combat system. These are powerful abilities that differ between each weapon, usually requiring a brief window to channel before you unleash them, meaning their usage needs to be considered and deliberate. They're quite varied too; the Witch Staff lets you fire off a wave of damage in front and behind you when channeling its standard attack, while the Sister Blades instead give you the ability to teleport to a distant enemy when engaging an Omega attack on the same button press. Each of these Omega abilities is powered by magic, a new resource that you'll have to carefully manage to get the most out of your build. Magic is replenished between each room you travel to, so you’re encouraged to maximize its usage for the battle at hand rather than forcing you to forgo it for a boss later on. Omega attacks can be unleashed frequently, and new abilities from boons feel increasingly powerful as they tap into the resource too. Magic has a powerful impact on the way Hades 2 plays, drastically changing how the game plays and feels, making its predecessor feel quite plain by comparison."
"Additional combat variety is afforded to Melinoe thanks to all the gifts she's bestowed by the various gods of Olympus. There's familiar faces such as Aphrodite and Hermes, as well as entirely new ones. Hestia, for example, offers her flame-damage dealing boons as a way to introduce damage-over-time strategies to Melinoe’s repertoire, while Hera's tricky-to-master Hitch curse lets you deal damage to those you've already marked simultaneously. Each boon gives you specific elemental abilities to play around with, letting you cobble together a combination that plays off each one's strengths to make the most of a run. With more boons in the mix, as well as more ways to utilize the themes of existing ones across the swathe of new offensive options, there's a greater depth to Hades 2's builds that keeps each run feeling viable and exciting. It's completely possible to have a run where the randomness of the boons lead to a doomed endeavor, but because of its expanded combat options and ways in which they can be enhanced, I'm confident that it's happening far less than in the first game."
"Hades 2 could already emphatically be declared as a brilliant successor to one of the greatest rougelites out there ... [it] improves upon its predecessor in every way, making it a masterfully crafted sequel"
"This additional depth to combat is kept entertaining thanks to an entirely new roster of enemies to contend with, many of which demand a quick understanding of the new combat avenues available to you and how best to take advantage of them. Simple, slow-swinging brutes might be commonplace in the first few encounters of a run, but they're quickly supplanted by seemingly neverending waves of small but deadly floating fish in later ones, or heavily armored soldiers that require quick reflexes to keep out of their wide-reaching melee strikes. Boss encounters are the true standouts though, ranging from an interesting roster of mid-bosses that you'll encounter quite frequently, to the show-stopping skirmishes that await you at the end of each biome. These are massive climatic battles against Hades 2's most challenging foes, each with their own fascinating theme around them. A standout is Scylla and the Sirens, which pits you against three foes with distinct abilities in a musically charged battle that borders on overwhelming the first few times you undertake it. It's a layered battle that challenges you to cleverly balance which one of the three you're going to focus on at a given time in order to take out their respective attack from the equation. This battle is an experience that's accentuated by Hades 2's exceptional soundtrack, composed again by Darren Korb. The music melds a thumping double-bass and roaring electric guitar with the smooth vocals of Ashley Barret, who continues to outdo themselves with each new game they feature in."
"Each of Hades 2's biomes also marks a departure from the environments from the first game, which might be relieving to hear given you'll be mostly traversing the depths of Hades again, albeit on a journey downwards rather than up. Alternative paths lead you to new areas that are bursting with color and character, with Supergiant's distinctive art style shown in its best light here. The third biome currently feels like an outlier, trading the tight combat spaces for a more open approach to exploration that sometimes makes the path forward a little difficult to discern. But it's a small blip on an otherwise outstanding reimagining of the depths of hell, which is accentuated by the nostalgic return of familiar spaces in the game's later, and more climatic, sections. It's surprising too that traversing the depth of Hades is not the only path you can take for a run, with an entirely different route to take during a run opened a few hours into your playthrough.. The choice of which narrative thread to follow, along with the quantity of content it added to the overall package, just further shows how much more ambitious Supergiant is with its first-ever sequel."
"While you'll spend the majority of your time dungeon-crawling your way to success, Hades 2 puts a bigger emphasis on what you do in between runs too. The Crossroads, a refuge that sits between the base of Mount Olympus and the depth of Hades, acts as the sequel's analog to the House of Hades, offering up a multitude of base-building options that all have tangible effects on your effectiveness during runs. A large, bubbling cauldron in the center lets you combine resources to unlock new parts of the Crossroads, as well as helpful shops and newer resource types to collect during runs. A small garden lets you plant specific seeds that sprout while you're out, folding back into the requirements for more expansion via the aforementioned cauldron. There are familiars to recruits, a training ground to hone your skills, and a variety of vendors to shop with in order to prepare to make the best of each run before you set out."
"Paramount to character progression is a new arcana card system that replaces Zagreus's sometimes one-dimensional upgrade mirror from the first game. It's split into two components: one is a massive tree of unlockable arcana cards, each of which gives you an advantage of some sort during your run. This can be as simple as rewarding you with a Death Defiance, which keeps you alive after an otherwise fatal blow, or buffing your total magic and health even before a run starts. Others, like giving you the ability to deal additional damage to foes with two curses, or buffing damage as long as your magic isn't fully replenished, define a tone and strategy to your run before starting, helping you craft your play style accordingly as you go. The number of arcana cards you can equip is determined by your Grasp; a numerical total that you can expand with a different resource as you chip away at runs. Each card has an associated cost depending on its overall effect, so you're challenged to balance which ones to equip based on your capabilities at a given time. The more cards you unlock, and the more Grasp you obtain, the bigger advantage you take into a run, and thus the greater chance you have of completion. It's a far more dynamic system than the on-off switches in the previous game, tying in nicely to the already deeper choices you have available in combat."
"Core too to the Crossroads, and integral to the way Hades 2 tells its tale, is the assortment of characters you can converse with between each run. Just like the first game, this is where Hades 2 really distinguishes itself from its peers in the genre, with the unbelievable way in which its script incorporates each of your actions fluidly into its core narrative to make it feel like this script is being written as you play. The new characters within the Crossroads are just as interesting and varied as they were before, whether you're confiding in the sassy but insecure shade Dora, discussing strategy with Odysseus, or brushing up against the prickly nature of another of Nyx's offspring, Nemesis. There's a more dire tone to the overall narrative given the impetus to save your family and reclaim your right as heir to Hades, as opposed to the sometimes shallow rebellious plight of Zagreus, but it's interwoven deftly without removing the brevity and sometimes hilarious writing that keeps this tale just as endearing."
"Being in early access, there's still the potential for a lot of these mechanics to change, and Supergiant has already made it clear with its first patch that it's willing to take big swings. Prior to the update, resource gathering was limited to an unlockable tool you could equip, limiting you to that specific resource in a run. That's been removed entirely now, letting you gather any resource you've unlocked a tool for at any time, and instead just prioritizing the likelihood of a resource associated with a particular tool appearing if you equip it. This drastically reduces a lot of early-game grinding and gets you going with upgrades a lot quicker, which changes the balance greatly from what was initially established. It's impossible to tell how much more might change before Supergiant plans to launch Hades 2 in a 1.0 state sometime next year, but it's an indication of how this otherwise complete-feeling product still has room to improve."
"On the horizon, Hades 2 still has a new area that is planned to be added, additional weapons, and some missing character art to fill in. And, most importantly, it has an ending to its story to introduce, but none of this hampers the engrossing experience that's available today. It's a drastic difference from the first game's launch, which felt far earlier in the process and required nearly two years to reach a complete state. As it stands, Hades 2 is already one of the best roguelite experiences you can play today, with clever improvements on its established formula that just accentuate its strongest attributes. More importantly, it does this without requiring you to be the most well-versed player on what came before, but not at the expense of offering a new challenge to those that have spent hours digging away at the first game's most brutal endeavors. Hades 2 is a game that I'm incredibly excited to continue playing every day, and it feels like a treat that it could get even better as time ticks away."
"Let's get straight to the (unsurprising) statement: Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door for Nintendo Switch is an incredible turn-based RPG that is every bit as charming, witty, and joyful today as it was two decades ago. Much like 2023's Super Mario RPG, Nintendo didn't mess with the formula so this is the game you know and love, only it's prettier, sounds better, and includes several meaningful quality-of-life updates. But whereas Super Mario RPG was quite obviously an old game reborn for a new generation, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door stands toe-to-toe with the best turn-based RPGs of the current console generation."
"Considering Paper Mario's bizarre history over the past two decades, newcomers would be forgiven for not knowing what the heck to expect in The Thousand-Year Door. To be blunt, Paper Mario's original identity and soul disappeared in the wake of The Thousand-Year Door. Today, Paper Mario is perhaps best-known as the Mario series that can't seem to pick a genre. But The Thousand-Year Door, much like its N64 predecessor, follows the tradition of Super Mario RPG and is more aligned with the Mario & Luigi series--the now-defunct series that pushed Paper Mario out of the genre--than any of the Paper Mario games that came after it, including The Origami King. And The Thousand-Year Door's Switch version further solidifies its spot at the top of the Mario RPG tier list."
"The visual upgrade is more of a fresh coat of paint than a total overhaul. Its storybook aesthetic with pop-up characters and environmental trappings had a timeless quality to it already, but the new widescreen presentation, with its vivid colors and crisp textures, brings memorable locations up to modern standards. The lush flowers and white-petaled trees of Boggly Woods are stunning, Twilight Town's and Creepy Steeple's gloominess is heightened (especially on Switch OLED), and better lighting and shadows make the waters around Keelhaul Key really pop. Environments aren't as richly layered as you'd find in The Origami King, but The Thousand-Year Door is still a beautiful game that could pass for a native Switch title."
"It runs exceptionally well, too. I didn't experience a single drop in performance in my 41 hours (and counting) in docked or handheld modes. Snappy load times, instantaneous saving, consistently smooth animations, precise input recognition for timing-based Action Commands–this is about as good as it gets for an enhanced version of an all-time classic."
"The GameCube version had one of the best soundtracks beneath the entire Super Mario umbrella. I'd actually say the remixed soundtrack is more of a revamp than the visuals. Don't worry, you get a badge early on that lets you switch back to the original without using any Badge Points, for those who want the classic musical accompaniment. Nostalgia will likely prevail for some, but I'd strongly urge longtime fans to give the new OST a try in each chapter. Along with remixed tracks, individualized battle themes capture the vibe of each locale, so the new tunes elevate the already superb turn-based combat system."
"For the most part, the Switch version mirrors the gameplay of the original. That said, the handful of newly implemented features make a meaningful impact, most notably with regards to respecting your time. If you played the original, you surely remember the General White wild goose chase that involved significant, tedious backtracking. The new fast-travel room beneath Rogueport town square remedies that annoyance and plenty more. After completing each chapter, a new warp pipe that can instantly send you back to the central area of each chapter appears. In addition to fixing the near-infamous General White fiasco, fast travel is extremely useful for quickly revisiting locations after more partners with new abilities join your team. Backtracking was always necessary to secure certain items, including a few key ones, and now it's a more streamlined and enjoyable process."
"Similarly, Game Over no longer means automatically starting at the last save block. Along with numerous auto-save moments throughout the campaign, you now have the choice of whether to return to your last save or try the scene again after you fall in battle. Game Over in the original sometimes meant losing 30 minutes or more of progress, but now you can start in the same room you met your demise in. Critically, your stats return to what they were when you entered the room. So if you were in bad shape before, you'll still be in bad shape. You still need to reach a save block to actually record your progress, but restarting from the scene simply means you don't have to replay content you already conquered. And since The Thousand-Year Door is a 30-plus hour RPG, any feature centered on respecting my time is greatly appreciated."
"Another useful new feature is the Partner Ring, a wheel you can pull up with the press of a button and scroll through to instantly swap partners instead of opening the full menu. This may sound small, but since only one of Mario's six or seven partners (one is optional) can accompany him at any given moment, instant swapping is ultimately an impactful change. Partners play a big role in solving puzzles and making progress through each area, as they have unique abilities that are used regularly to interact with your surroundings. For instance, former stage actress Madame Flurrie can blow gusts of wind that remove peeling paper from walls to reveal hidden passages and treasures. Hopping on Yoshi's back increases movement speed and lets you flutter across longer gaps. Meanwhile, Koops, a brave little Koopa with a long-lost dad, has a shell toss move that snags unreachable items and activates time-sensitive switches. Admiral Bobbery, a sailor Bob-omb with a thick mustache and a broken heart, can blow up cracked walls. There are times when you need to use multiple partner abilities in fairly quick succession, so the new wheel, however small it may sound, really made a difference in terms of keeping me in the flow."
"The other main improvements make The Thousand-Year Door more inviting to new players and limit the number of progression roadblocks. If you get stuck at any point, pressing ZL initiates a partner hint. Many of the general progression hints are relayed by Mario's first companion Goombella, but other partners will chime in if the task at hand relies on their abilities. A new NPC also points you in the right direction for Trouble Center sidequests if you need help. These fairly sophisticated systems add many, many new lines of dialogue. It's one of the better hint systems I've seen in a game, as it provides truly useful clues without fully spelling it out for you. It's a nudge in the right direction and will keep those who don't care for puzzles moving along to the next story beat or battle sequence."
"Speaking of battles, the turn-based encounters are unchanged, which means there's a huge catalog of Action Commands to master, each of which requires nuanced and well-timed inputs to inflict maximum damage and block incoming attacks. The user interface and on-screen prompts received a facelift, but the movesets for Mario and his seven partners, special attacks, and library of badges align with the original. For newcomers or those looking for a refresher, that's where the Battle Master can be helpful. The new NPC hangs out near the new fast-travel warp pipes in each main area. The Battle Master will set up dummy enemies on a rehearsal stage so you can practice Action Commands, and they also have a long list of tips and explainers that steadily grows as you unlock new partners and moves."
"It's easy to understand why the battle and overarching progression systems weren't altered. The Thousand-Year Door has the best combat mechanics of any Mario role-playing game, Paper variety or not. On defense, Action Commands adhere to the single button press timing mechanic of Super Mario RPG, but Mario's and his partner's moves evolve far beyond that straightforward action. Some ask you to hold and release buttons with the right timing, others involve flicking the analog stick or pressing a sequence of buttons. Story-based upgrades and badges further modify Mario's comically large hammer swings and famous jump attacks."
"Badges modify stats and essentially act as the gear system. Outside of basic attacks, all battle moves consume FP (Flower Points). Since I loved using some of the high-cost FP moves, I made sure to equip badges that lowered the consumption of FP and regenerated points with successful strikes. The badge system is quite versatile, allowing you to tailor your setup to your play style. While there are 86 badges in all--one more than before due to the original soundtrack badge--you are limited by Mario's BP (Badge Points)."
"When Mario levels up, you can choose one of three core stats to upgrade: HP, FP, or BP. Mario is the only character with a traditional leveling system, so FP and BP are essentially shared pools for the whole seven- to eight-character team. It sounds peculiar, but it works exceedingly well. On top of that, this quirk rewards exploration, as you need three Shine Sprites to ""level up"" each partner to unlock new moves and remain on mostly equal footing with Mario in terms of attack power and HP. There are 42 Shine Sprites scattered across the Mushroom Kingdom, so you can level up each partner twice. If you don't increase the stats of your partners in the back half of the game, they will likely get wrecked by virtually any of the many dozens of enemies, from Hammer Bros and Chain Chomps to Magikoopas and Frost Piranhas. And if not by any regular enemies, late-game bosses will probably do the trick--unless you are really good at Superguarding."
"Though I wouldn't call The Thousand-Year Door an exceedingly challenging game, it's superbly balanced, with enough bite to add tension to many battles. Limiting Mario to fighting alongside one partner at a time and arranging enemies in a straight line, rather than side by side--which effectively shields the back of the line from certain attacks--makes your battle partner and move choices matter. Despite routinely countering enemy attacks, I still saw the Game Over screen a handful of times. More importantly, I was pushed to the brink on many other occasions. Perhaps most importantly, I fought nearly every enemy I saw wandering the overworld, and I never felt underleveled or overleveled."
"Unfortunately, the quality-of-life enhancements don't extend to difficulty sliders or accessibility options. While badges like Simplify make Action Commands easier to execute, equipping it makes your special move gauge refill more slowly, so you're negatively impacted in a way for using them. On the flip side, the Unsimplify badge shrinks timing windows and hastens special meter regeneration. Adept players reap the rewards, while those who may need some assistance with Action Commands make concessions. These badges and others like Double Pain (Mario takes double damage) existed in the original game, and it's great that they're still here. But badge modifiers won't change the fact that some Action Commands will be tricky (or impossible) for some players with limited mobility. For instance, Yoshi's Ground Pound and several other moves are straight button-mashers. A setting that alters the more mechanically involved quick-time events to be single-button taps ala Super Mario RPG would have been a nice addition."
"Though the story falls within familiar Mario territory--Peach is kidnapped by the X-Nauts, an evil alien-robot (something like that) organization led by Sir Grodus--the writing and characterization are sublime. Mario's role-playing games have always featured zany dialogue, memorable characters, and a lot of heart. The Thousand-Year Door is no different. All seven partners are marked by the desire to prove something to themselves and the world. Though they're all great, it's somewhat ridiculous that all four female partners--Goombella, Vivian, Madame Flurrie, and Ms. Mowz (optional)--clearly have the hots for Mario, whereas Admiral Bobbery and Koops have emotional ties that extend beyond the unavailable mustachioed hero. At least in Vivian's case, Mario is seemingly the first person to show her kindness. Yeah, there are depressing undercurrents beneath a lot of the humor."
"The Thousand-Year Door has so many great lines of dialogue that touch on the full range of human emotions that it's absolutely worth your time to talk to every NPC you encounter and read the messages sent to Mario's Game Boy Advance SP communication device--there are some real gems in there. A few lines of dark humor actually made my mouth drop, and it's hard to believe that the words of a Bob-omb with a steering wheel attached to his back got to me more than any game in a long time. There's even a conversation about the need for renewable energy sources--as a reminder, this game is from 2004."
"The pacing remains uneven in spots–Creepy Steeple still has some tedious backtracking and the Glitz Pit still features 20 mostly simple battles with nearly identical preambles between each–but the vast majority of the 30-plus hour adventure keeps the story moving while gradually adding new mechanics to combat as well as exploration, such as Mario's ability to turn into a paper boat to move across water and roll into a small cylinder to access small passageways. And the interludes between chapters featuring (briefly) playable characters Peach and Bowser remain fun breathers between hunts for the Crystal Stars that open the eponymous door beneath Rogueport."
"The Switch version of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is the definitive way to play the best turn-based RPG starring Mario. More of an enhanced HD remaster than a full-fledged remake, The Thousand-Year Door has small yet meaningful quality-of-life features that ease some of the bloat from the original GameCube version. The catchy remixed soundtrack wonderfully complements the thoroughly entertaining and dynamic turn-based battle system. Throw in a stellar cast of characters and consistently playful writing, and The Thousand-Year Door has all the ingredients of an incredible turn-based RPG. Well, it always had them, but now they are blended a bit better."
"Lorelei and the Laser Eyes is a psychological horror puzzle game that sent me on a winding journey through a black and white, neon-red-accented hotel, to untangle a mystery that blurred the line between fact and fiction. It is dense with puzzles, heavy on story, but both are interwoven, and that is key to the way it unravels. I was consistently thrown off the path to the truth, led astray in what I perceived as a maze, when in actuality, I was being armed with knowledge that led me through a labyrinth to the game's heart-wrenching conclusion."
"With no setup or direction, the game simply begins. You take control of a suave, sunglasses-wearing, 1960s mod-style dressed woman, standing alone in the woods at night, just outside the historic-looking Hotel Letztes Jahr. Like its main character, you are thrown into this world with no knowledge of who or where you are, or why you're there. The goal of the game is to find the truth, as said verbatim in the game's manual, which is found within the world itself as opposed to being accessible by default. This obtuse direction set the tone for the game--foreshadowing that I was going to have to work to understand anything and everything on the journey before me. It pulled me right in, feeding into my natural curiosity and love for mysteries. The discovery of its hidden truths is tracked via a Truth Recovery percentage in the game's menu. It isn't long, though, until you find a letter with a vague and mysterious message signed by Renzo Nero explaining that you were invited to be at this hotel, on this date, in the year 1963."
"You are left to your own devices to investigate, unlock, and unravel every aspect of the game, with your progress starting at 0% and tracked throughout the game. No piece of information is simply handed to you, but rather uncovered. The manual, for example, is locked away and requires a key to obtain it. However, the game can be completed without ever actually finding its manual at all. This is a small example of the game's nonlinearity and the trust it instilled in me to find things on my own. Recovering every piece of the story is not necessary to complete the game, but doing so deeply rewards those who take the time to investigate every nook and cranny of its cryptic world."
"As it turns out, Renzo Nero is a rather eccentric artist with a taste for theatrics and has invited you to partake in an artistic project. When entering the solemn hotel, you begin to slowly uncover the story of your larger-than-life host, who has seemingly prepared everything for you in a hotel that is as much a maze as it is an intricate puzzle box. But like all good puzzles, nothing is what it seems and you're thrust into a sprawling and complex maze of mysteries. You must explore its labyrinthine halls and peel back the story of your involvement in this artist's project one piece of evidence at a time. As this incredibly cool looking woman, you can freely walk through a series of scenes viewed through fixed camera angles, which depict a black and white world made up of vector-style 3D graphics through a cinematic lens."
"Each piece of information is not only necessary to piecing together the story, but acts as knowledge to solve the game's dozens upon dozens of puzzles. Whether it's news articles, books on Roman numerals, strobogrammatic numerology, or the Greek alphabet (just to name a few), all serve as tools used to venture further into the hotel. Unlike most puzzle games that establish their own language and style of puzzle, Lorelei and the Laser Eyes instead uses real-world concepts and logic, like math and brain teasers, contextualized by story information that invites you to push forward. Where a puzzle game like The Witness uses its puzzle mechanics to teach the player about its world, Lorelei and the Laser Eyes leans on the player's existing knowledge and understanding of basic problem-solving. In that regard, this game could be a barrier to entry for some players, but it also builds on the knowledge players have to expand their understanding, which greatly rewards veteran puzzle lovers like myself."
"It's a lot to remember, and certainly an education in a lot of areas like Latin terms or the meaning behind Greek symbols, for example. Thankfully, the main character has a photographic memory that saves everything you pick up, and can be viewed at any point in the game. But her photographic memory will only get you so far in finding the solutions to its puzzles, and your very own pen and paper (or a notebook, in my case) feels necessary in order to find and remember the solution for all its obstacles. In my actual day-to-day life, I'm already an avid notebook user. At all times, I have one on me to jot down notes and ideas, or plan ahead--sometimes I use my notebook to work through problems in my life. This need to use pen and paper to solve the game's problems fed directly into how I manage my everyday life. It's incredibly satisfying and cool to have real-life habits overlap with playing the game in a way that is tangible and sincerely helpful in progressing through Lorelei and the Laser Eyes."
"As you move through the ghostly monochrome hotel, every door, drawer, gate, passageway, diary, and just about everything else, requires a solution to be opened or unlocked. Some doors are locked from the other side, while others require a specific key found elsewhere (often after solving another puzzle), or are padlocked with a code yet to be discovered. Sometimes the solution comes by way of the environment around you, so examining posters, or looking for riddles or brain teasers nearby is necessary. Other times it requires cross-examining information you've already gathered, like a specific year mentioned in a telegram, or scanning over astronomical objects. If it sounds dense, that's because it is. But the game paces out information, and gives the players all the right tools to allow puzzles to be solved without overwhelming you. In most cases, if you can't find the solution around you, or in any of the documents you have in your photographic memory, it's safe to say you haven't discovered the clues necessary for the solution yet, but this deduction is also left for you to make."
"There were a few instances where I felt I had hit a wall, having found several puzzles that I simply couldn't understand. It added several hours of experimentation to my journey, as I tried to find logic in anything, only to realize that I had forgotten about a note I grabbed at the beginning of the game that alluded to a small detail elsewhere in the hotel that I had completely overlooked. It was frustrating, but also a valuable lesson in realizing that if something didn't make sense to me, I likely didn't have what I needed yet. After I had that realization, navigating the maze became more of a meditative journey--it was a moment of self-discipline and a reminder to myself that I didn't have to solve everything the moment I had discovered it. There was peace in that realization; in stepping back, being patient, and taking my time."
"The puzzles are difficult, and while many of them left me scratching my head for hours sometimes, they never felt impossible. Thankfully, the game's nonlinear nature makes it a practice in simply knowing when it's time to take a break and move on to another puzzle. That also means keeping track of every bit of information you come across, which is one of many reasons why having a notebook is vital. During my 34-hour playthrough, I had filled 31 pages of my notebook with hectic scribbles, noting down any information of importance, such as dates noted in documents or names, which could be used to either decode one answer, or used to combine with another. My notebook became a companion in my playthrough, filled with numbers and equations and cryptic symbols, often involving Roman numerals, lunar phases, or astrology, and I loved every single second of it."
"Lorelei and the Laser Eyes bombards you with so much information, so many puzzles, and so many enigmatic problems, that having my notebook by my side only managed to pull me into the experience of the game further. Oh, and also, with a cup of coffee there too."
"I consumed a lot of coffee while playing this game. This meant having to use the bathroom a lot. While this may seem irrelevant to the game itself, it's actually an important thing to note. This game will require patience, and oftentimes, getting up and physically walking away from it to process its many puzzles, as many of the solutions will not appear magically. Sometimes all it takes is a break, clearing your mind (or bladder), and coming back with a fresh pair of laser eyes to have that satisfying eureka moment."
"This reliance on writing in a notebook and cross-examining my own notes was alleviated by the fact that the game, if you're playing on Switch, can be played with one Joy-Con. The control scheme is incredibly simple, as everything can be interacted with using a single button press, making holding a pencil in the other hand (or a cup of coffee), an engaging way to play the game. As a result, it makes playing on the Switch my preferred way to experience it."
"As the game and story progress, you unlock more halls and areas of the hotel, and with it, a discovery that what you've been perceiving as reality is being bent and molded to drag you deeper into its chill-inducing horror. These moments and the revelations that come from them are better experienced than explained, so I won't go into detail. But there are several scenarios in the latter half of the game that subverted my expectations so effectively that they had me pulling at my hair in shock."
"The game's horror is also emphasized by using the medium of games itself exceptionally well. Much of Lorelei and the Laser Eyes' biggest themes center around the relationship between art and technology, and its direct correlation with the artistic medium of games. Through this lens, Simogo uses game development as a narrative throughline that guides you through different eras of games, like the low-poly horror of the first PlayStation or the lo-fi charm of 1-bit point-and-click adventure games. There's a meta narrative under the hood of Lorelei and the Laser Eyes that will deeply reward those intimate with gaming as a medium, as well as Simogo's previous works. Crucially, these aren't necessary to understand and enjoy the game as whole, they just enrich it further."
"Similar to The Ring's use of VHS tapes, PlayStation 1-style graphics are used at times to evoke the rudimentary, degraded presentation of yesteryear to establish an unnerving tone--a jarring contrast to the game's usual clean and modern graphics. Witnessing this whiplash of bygone style of games and seeing it recycled in a rather menacing way was awesome. It felt as though it was cleverly using my existing knowledge of PS1-era games to its advantage. Not just in a way that captures nostalgia, but to elevate the game's more horror-like tones. Similarly, even the role of playtesting games becomes its own topic, extending its meta themes, and even acting as satire in certain parts."
"Lorelei and the Laser Eyes is a massive achievement in using the games as a medium and an art form to tell a story that can only be experienced in a video game. Over the course of my time with it, I was surprised and astounded at Simogo's ability to subvert my expectations to convey a story that touches on art and technology, and the magical illusion of storytelling, all while using the foundation of puzzle design to not just arm me with knowledge, but use it to find the truth. It can often feel like a harrowing maze built on riddles and deception, but through perseverance, you can find your way to the center of this labyrinth and a truth worth knowing."
"Crow Country is coated in a murky green veneer that gives the impression you're playing it on a grainy CRT TV in one of your friend's bedrooms back in 1996. The polygonal figure of its protagonist, Special Agent Mara Forest, with her visible joints and single block of purple hair, harks back to any number of PlayStation-era character designs. Similarly, Crow Country's environments look wonderfully pre-rendered, lavished in extra detail that sits in stark contrast to its simple, blocky characters. These aren't the static backgrounds of yesteryear, however, but fully interactive playgrounds that add a modern tinge to Crow Country's distinctly retro sensibilities."
"This affectionate nostalgia is in service of a game that pays loving homage to landmark titles of the survival horror genre while also boldly standing on its own two feet. Resident Evil is Crow Country's most obvious influence, but traces of Silent Hill and Alone in the Dark also stalk the darkest corners of its '90s-inspired horror. It can be a tad too authentic at times, featuring unwieldy combat that's tempting to ignore completely, but this is still a true advert for the joys of retro-modern survival horror when executed well."
"Set in 1990, your first taste of the titular Crow Country occurs when Mara pulls into its parking lot in a white facsimile of a Volkswagen Polo. Crow Country is a decrepit, abandoned theme park that's both dense and labyrinthine despite its small scale--as if designed by the same architect who worked on The Spencer Mansion and Racoon City Police Station. Mara is here following up on a missing person's report for the park's owner, Edward Crow, but it doesn't take long before she's unraveling the park's deepest secrets and most intriguing mysteries."
"The story unravels out of chronological order as you discover notes left behind by employees, read old newspaper clippings, and interact with a small cast of relatable NPCs. It's expertly paced, with sharp writing that's self-aware and includes plenty of nods to both gaming and horror tropes without feeling corny. Discovering what happened in the two years since the park closed down propels the story forward, and it sticks the landing with a memorable ending. Crucially, Crow Country also doesn't follow a familiar pattern despite being a pastiche of genre classics in almost every other facet of its design. There's no zombie outbreak or missing wife, and the theme park setting is a refreshingly unfamiliar location, capturing the same kind of uncertainty that the first Resident Evil achieved in 1996."
"There are monsters in the form of aberrant Cronenberg-esque designs that range from bipedal shamblers to amorphous blobs. Their origins are tragic, tracing back to human hubris and greed, but you can also play the entire game without them. Crow Country offers two modes of play: Survival and exploration. The latter removes any trace of the park's enemies so you can focus on exploration and puzzle solving, which gives you a good idea of where the game's priorities lie."
"During survival mode, the park gradually fills with grotesque creatures as you delve further into the game's story. In true survival horror fashion, you can avoid most enemy encounters by simply running past them, conserving your limited supply of ammo in the process. This has the knock-on effect of populating the park with extra creatures, but the presence of more enemies never feels problematic, and I only bothered engaging in combat if they were directly impeding a puzzle."
"This is partly because the survival aspect of Crow Country is relatively easy. Unless you're fighting absolutely every enemy or aren't thoroughly exploring, ammo is plentiful enough, and the same is true of med kits and antidotes. There also aren't a lot of genuine threats to your life. The small, skittish Pinochio-esque creatures are surprising at first because they're fast, and the rattle of bones that accompanies the strangely elongated skeletons might tempt you to nope the hell out, but both are rare and simple enough to breeze past that they never pose much danger. You won't find a pack of zombie dogs bursting through a window or encounter deadly frog-like creatures in tight corridors, so the sense of challenge is severely lacking. Inventory management--normally a staple of the genre--is also notable for its absence. Instead of having to carefully pick which items and weapons to take with you, you can go into the final boss fight with all four firearms fully stocked, further diminishing any sense of reward when it comes to the game's combat."
"Another reason you might avoid combat entirely is that it isn't particularly engaging. Crow Country is played from an intimate isometric viewpoint with free camera movement, immediately making it more palatable than the games it's inspired by. That said, aiming and shooting with an isometric camera feels deliberately awkward and clunky, especially because you're aiming both horizontally and vertically. You're locked in place when doing so, which at least makes you vulnerable and adds an element of tension as you fiddle with your laser pointer, but taking down enemies is still straightforward even when the controls are fighting against you. There's a natural progression of weapon unlocks as you start with Mara's service pistol before acquiring a shotgun, magnum, and flamethrower. Apart from some weapons dealing more damage than others, however, there isn't a palpable difference in feel between each one, so their impact is largely dulled."
"Despite these shortcomings, Crow Country still manages to establish a creepy atmosphere as you navigate the park's various nooks and crannies. It might be an ominous low hum or the comforting--yet somehow still offputting--music playing in every save room, but the game's score does an excellent job of building tension with music reminiscent of the era. The dilapidated theme park setting is also a significant part of the game's overall charm, whether you're exploring the aquatic zone with its imported sand and fake starfish, rushing past the fairy forest's abundance of giant mushrooms, or skulking through the haunted town to reach a spooky mansion and underground crypt. The janky animatronics and pervasive crow-theming would be eerie even before introducing monsters, broken glass, and ominous blood spatter to the equation."
"Each zone is distinct and memorable enough that navigating the park is a breeze. It also helps that the entire map's layout is incredibly intuitive. After walking up a miniature version of Disneyland's Main Street, you come to an open square that acts as the park's centerpiece, with doorways splitting off into all three zones. The map is open-ended, encouraging you to slowly expand your access to different areas by venturing back and forth to find all sorts of clues and items. Interconnected shortcuts through staff rooms and back offices remove the tedium of backtracking, and the park gradually begins to fold back in on itself, revealing a hidden depth that belies its relatively small scale. It's inherently satisfying to unearth a new doorway leading to a previous area where you now have the items needed to solve a puzzle and make even more progress, and Crow Country is teeming with rewarding moments like this."
"The puzzles themselves are fun to solve, too, expertly toeing the line between befuddling and condescendingly easy. Employee notes and company memos sometimes provide hints, but most solutions derive from logic and common sense--even if the former is a distinct flavor of survival horror logic. The map's smaller scale works in its favor here as well, with many of the puzzles being quite self-contained. The items you need to solve a particular conundrum are often nearby, and even if you have to venture further afield, it never takes too long to get back. The puzzle designs are also delightfully varied, tasking you with playing specific notes on a piano to open hidden compartments, uncover a key by melting an animatronic's head with acid, and solve a riddle using the names on various gravestones while a skeletal arm waves a shotgun in your face."
"Crow Country pays homage to a golden era of survivor horror without relying on simple mimicry. It's simultaneously familiar and yet unfamiliar, touching on tropes and genre trappings while utilizing modern techniques to enhance the experience and make it more approachable for newcomers. It's not a particularly challenging game, and combat is dull and unwieldy, but this aspect of the game is easy enough to ignore, especially when there's an enticing theme park full of secrets and rewarding puzzles to delve into. The story is also surprisingly rich, telling a captivating tale with smart writing and a memorable ending. Crow Country is clearly lovingly crafted, resulting in a nostalgic throwback that manages to avoid feeling derivative. It does justice to the games that inspired it, but it's also a fantastic game in its own right."
"It's usually pretty easy to predict how a 2D Metroidvania is going to play out. At some point, you'll probably unlock a double or even triple jump to reach previously inaccessible areas, obtain an air dash that helps you traverse large gaps and pass through specific blockades, and acquire a weapon upgrade that functions as both a killing tool and a way to progress past certain obstacles. Animal Well contains most of these things, but never in ways that are expected. Created by solo developer Billy Basso and published by Bigmode, Animal Well is a surrealist puzzle platformer that's delightfully surprising. Even if its pixelated art style and genre trappings make it seem familiar on the surface, it is a game that often eschews conventional wisdom and stands out because of it."
"You play as a nondescript blob who emerges from a blossoming flower into a strange vibrant world filled with creatures big and small. You can move and jump, but that's about the extent of your physical prowess. Upon awakening, you're free to explore in any direction you choose. Animal Well doesn't hold your hand and is exceedingly non-linear, letting you unlock items and abilities in whichever order you find them. There is an end goal that's revealed once you discover a map and get a lay of the land, as each corner of the map contains a flame you need to fetch in order to light the four beacons at its center. Why, you might ask? There isn't an explicit explanation for anything you do, but that sense of mystery is part of what drives the adventure forward."
"The other part is the world of Animal Well itself. At first glance, its pixelated art style looks simple, yet each screen holds a deceptive layer of detail beyond its neon-drenched exterior. Whether it's the cascading background elements, reflections on the water's surface, the sway of bushes and vines as you move past them, or the realistic smoke that billows into the air after igniting a firecracker, there's more to the visuals that it may seem on first blush. There are also physics, lighting, and particle systems at play that modernize the game's Commodore 64-inspired visuals, creating a world that feels very much alive, and that's without mentioning the abundance of wildlife."
"From giant technicolor swans to iguanas with elongated tongues capable of snatching up other animals, Animal Well's creature designs possess an enticing, dreamlike quality. Music is used sparingly, with the sounds of nature--of chirping birds and the pitter-patter of falling water--dominating the soundscape. When music does enter the fray, it's usually done to ratchet up the tension, introducing ominous synth tones that wouldn't feel out of place in an '80s thriller."
"Unlike many other Metroidvanias, Animal Well doesn't feature combat; the focus is purely on puzzle-solving and platforming. That doesn't mean there aren't any threats to your life, however. The tense music is there to complement a plethora of anxiety-inducing moments as you encounter aggressive animals and other nasties. Being chased by the ghostly apparition of a demonic cat is thrilling, just as being forced to cower underground as the long neck of an ostrich undulates towards you--its beak chomping at the bit--is incredibly suspenseful. Consumable firecrackers can scare away some creatures, while others require you to simply run away. Yet it's the gradual arsenal of tools at your disposal that makes a real difference."
"Like any good Metroidvania, Animal Well features various items that act as keys to progression while also introducing new gameplay mechanics. As I mentioned earlier, the options here are pleasantly surprising due to how they break from the norm. Instead of unlocking a traditional double jump, for example, you acquire a magic wand that creates bubbles, allowing you to hop on top of a floating sphere to reach higher platforms. This might not sound groundbreaking, but when you factor in the way certain enemies and objects in the environment can interact with these bubbles, their impact is much more varied than a simple double jump could ever be."
"The frisbee, meanwhile, can be used like a makeshift dash; provided there are two surfaces for it to bounce between. You can also launch it to flip faraway levers or distract certain animals, like dogs, giving you the opportunity to slip past unharmed. This emphasis on avoiding combat makes enemy encounters feel like puzzles to be solved, which seamlessly meshes with the rest of the game's engaging puzzle design."
"I was never stumped for long by any of Animal Well's conundrums, yet the solutions were nearly always creative enough that I constantly felt satisfied whenever I solved one. Most of the puzzles revolve around opening the path forward by activating a number of switches. This might be done by dropping a slinky and moving blocks to guide it down the right path or manipulating animals to walk on switches you can't reach yourself. Sometimes, you might use a yo-yo to flip a switch underneath you, ricochet the frisbee off two different levers to cause platforms to activate and de-activate--creating a timing-based platforming section--or use a crank to rotate platforms and redirect the spray from a water fountain into a bowl. I'm deliberately describing some of the earlier puzzles because discovering Animal Well's various conundrums yourself is a significant part of the experience. But these examples are a decent glimpse at the sheer variety on show."
"There are also secrets to be found in the nooks and crannies of Animal Well's densely packed map. These take the shape of various eggs that are then stored in a hub area containing a few locked doors. After finding a specific number of eggs, some of these doors begin to open, leading to new areas and new items. These items aren't necessary to progress towards the game's ending but instead seem to revolve around unlocking more hidden secrets. Once the final credits roll, you're free to continue playing in search of these mysteries, yet it doesn't seem like something one person will be able to figure out on their own. Maybe I'm wrong, but it has a similar feeling to Fez, whereby the internet is going to have to work together to uncover everything. That's an enticing prospect."
"For the most part, Animal Well's platforming isn't particularly challenging, but it feels precise to the point where you can stop on a dime in mid-air if you need to. The map is also small and interconnected enough that backtracking rarely feels laborious, although I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't have liked a way to move between areas instantly in those moments when I wasn't entirely sure where to go next. There are a couple of sections where dying multiple times is a distinct possibility, and it's here where backtracking can encroach on frustration due to the way respawning works. The last save point you used is where you'll reappear after dying, which can sometimes be a fair distance away. Normally, this is a non-issue, but when you encounter a section--like one involving moving platforms that can crush you in an instant--the long trek back quickly becomes demoralizing."
"It's impressive that this is the lone blemish on an otherwise excellent addition to the pantheon of great Metroidvanias. This is a game that's chock full of pleasant surprises, from the way its items forgo tradition in interesting ways to the visual design and sense of atmosphere generated by its bizarre, neon-soaked world. Animal Well might look antiquated and familiar at first glance, but this well is cavernous and unpredictable."
"Between the advent of cozy games, farm sims, rhythm games, narrative adventures, and more, we're in something of a golden age of non-violent games. If you want to take a break from shooting and punching and instead just relax with some chill vibes, you have myriad options available to you. Endless Ocean: Luminous is an aquatic take, letting you freely explore the ocean with no danger or violence to speak of whatsoever. It sometimes straddles the line between game and edutainment in ways that could be engaging, but achingly slow progression and a lack of realism leave it feeling washed up."
"Scientists say only 5% of the ocean has been explored. The name Endless Ocean, and the unexplored nature of the ocean itself, suggests an incredible degree of possibility and adventure. In practice, though, there actually isn't all that much to do in Endless Ocean: Luminous. You can take part in a Solo Dive, in which you explore a seemingly randomized map; a Shared Dive, which is just a Solo Dive with friends exploring the same map together online using Nintendo's Switch Online service (complete with its usual shortcomings); and Story Mode, which gives you short missions consisting of objectives accompanied by a little dialogue."
"With this dearth of options, its approach to progression gating further compounds the lack of variety. After the first handful of story missions, the others are locked behind scanning ocean creatures in Shared or Solo dives. To scan you just hold the L button in the direction of sea life until the meter fills, which then gives a detailed look at the creatures in your scan. But the progress gates are set so absurdly high that the novelty wears off quickly. One of the earliest gates is set at 500 scans, which felt high but reasonable. The next was at 1,000, so I had to get another 500. That rubbed me the wrong way. By the time I reached the next gate, set at 2,000--meaning I needed another 1,000 scans--the chill vibes were gone. I was just annoyed. It's hard to overstate how frustrating it is to spend almost an hour roaming around a randomized map scanning fish, only to exit the map and find I've only gained another 200 pips toward my next story goal. Plus, judging by the creature log, there are just under 600 species of sea life total in the game. Why would you need to scan 2,000 times to see a mid-game story mission?"
"Not that there's much story to tell. You're a new diver accompanied by an AI companion, exploring phenomena of glowing fish, and sometimes you're accompanied by a brash (but actually cowardly) fellow diver named Daniel. The story missions are short and largely uneventful. Sometimes they end so quickly that I was genuinely surprised. Other times, they feel like a glorified tutorial, which makes it that much stranger to gate it behind so much free-roaming playtime. At least one of them is just a cutscene with no actual diving gameplay whatsoever. Occasionally, the story mode will deliver something unexpected and fun, like a massive or fantastical species of fish, but those moments are few and far between. There is a meta-story involving an ancient relic with 99 slots, which you fill in by discovering certain artifacts scattered randomly throughout dives or by fulfilling achievement objectives, but it feels more like a busywork checklist than a real story-driver."
"And because the scanning requirements are so excessive, small inconveniences feel more impactful than they should. It's easy to pick up a fish you've already scanned while trying to register a new one. Every time you scan any fish, it zooms in on them for a moment, forcing you to hit B to back out of the detailed view. If you scan multiple species at once, they're grouped in a listing together, which is meant to be a convenience feature--but new species aren't prioritized in the list, so you need to scroll down to find any with a ""???"" designation to mark them as discovered. If you don't, the unidentified fish remains unidentified. If you scan a large school of the same fish, they'll all be listed separately. In Solo Dives, the map is slowly charted in segments as you explore, but keeping an eye on the map to make sure I was filling in the little squares meant I could fail to notice a fish swimming by, or I could miss a depth change that may reward me for diving deeper."
"Your dives get you experience points to level up, which increases your dive capacity, which you can use to tag sea creatures to swim alongside you. At first, these only include the smallest of sea creatures, but as you build capacity, you can swim with larger ones that are used to solve riddles. A stone tablet might challenge you to come back with a particular type of turtle or a fish that ""sails as it swims."" Even then, though, the solutions are too rigid. When I returned to the tablet with a ""Sailfish,"" nothing happened, presumably because it was not the specific solution the riddle had in mind."
"In addition to story progress and dive capacity, leveling up also opens new but severely limited tiers of customization options. Those include palette swaps for your diver or individual SCUBA suit parts, different stickers to apply to your profile, and emotes. There isn't even a different helmet or mouthpiece, just the default in different colors."
"It feels as if the goal was to create a virtual, interactive aquatic museum, and the variety of sea life does support this nicely. It actually is exciting the first time you see a new species of sea turtle or an extinct megalodon shark, even if you know that it can't hurt you. But the mechanical underpinnings get in the way of its potential as a museum too. For example, every species of fish has a blurb with some interesting marine facts, complete with a reading of it from your AI companion. This could be a cool and educational feature, but when you're pressed to perform thousands of scans, it's hard to bother listening to every blurb. There also isn't an indicator for when you've already heard a blurb, and since you'll see species repeated a lot, it's nearly impossible to remember which ones you have or haven't heard--even if you can tell dozens of roughly similar-looking fish apart, which I can't."
"In part due to its non-violent nature, Endless Ocean does not present the depths very realistically, even to my layman's eyes. Your oxygen is unlimited, and you don't need to worry about temperature or depth. You'll never freeze or get decompression sickness or drown. More aggressive species will never attack you. Species of fish seem to be scattered more or less randomly around the map, which leads to oddities like finding large-scale creatures in shallow waters, or discovering deep-sea dwellers in middle-depths instead of the deepest, almost pitch-black parts of the ocean where they actually reside. And while this is likely a limitation of the Switch hardware, the fish, coral, and ocean floor themselves aren't rendered photorealistically enough to instill a sense of awe and majesty."
"It seems Endless Ocean wants you to spend most of your time diving with friends to pass the time. The Shared Dives option is the first one on the menu, after all, and it is easier to fulfill the simple procedural objectives when you're paired with other divers. But like most Switch games, you join friendly games using a digital code, and there isn't built-in voice chat, so you can't really treat it like an underwater virtual lobby. Even if you could, though, scanning fish with your friends would not sustain the group fun for anyone but the most devoted of sea-life enthusiasts."
"Endless Ocean: Luminous could have been a realistic SCUBA sim with all the treacherous hazards that real underwater divers need to consider, a relaxing chill-vibes game that's mostly about finding fish with your friends, or a story-driven game centered around discovering awesome and even extinct underwater beasts. It has pieces of all of those, but it doesn't commit to any of them. Instead, it takes the enormity and glory of earth's largest and most mysterious region and turns exploring it into a dull, repetitive chore."
"Tennis, at its core, is a game about legacy. Names like Billie Jean King, Pete Sampras, and the Williams sisters are immortalized through legendary matches, on-court triumphs, and tournament dominance that have shaped the history of the sport. It seems appropriate, then, that the Top Spin series has lived on in similar reverence since Top Spin 4, which was released over a decade ago to critical acclaim. Now, with developer Hanger 13 at the helm, Top Spin makes its long-awaited return. It serves up an ace in the all-important gameplay aspects, but double faults on content and troubling microstransaction focus mean it’s still far from a grand slam."
"Gameplay takes center court in the newest entry and it's excellent. Moving around the court feels great thanks to a strong sense of momentum and weight. That's especially true on different surfaces, as the firm footing of a hard court gives way to sliding around on clay. It looks authentic, and factoring in the different starts and stops on the numerous types of surfaces is an important consideration when playing a match."
"Different shots are mapped to various buttons and do an excellent job conveying just how sophisticated volleys are. Whether you are hitting a hard straight shot, curving slices, or smashing a ball right up the line with hard-to-handle top spin, the various options are meaningfully different. A simple timing system lets you tap for controlled returns, or hold to generate power, with both options depending on releasing at the right moment to determine accuracy. It’s straightforward, and rewarding to execute . There's a place and application for each, like intentionally hitting a slow rolling shot to give yourself an opportunity to reposition yourself on the court, or sending a lob high over the head of an opponent who has creeped too close to the net."
"That strategic element of tennis is Top Spin's biggest triumph. Trading power-shots as you send your opponent all over the court expending energy is exhilarating thanks to the sense of speed and impact. Breaking yourself out of the same situation by returning a ball in an awkward spot with unwiedly spin, creating a fault from the other player, is a diabolical joy. There's a ""chess, but with rackets"" quality to the game of tennis that translates well to Top Spin 2K25, and dominating on the court is as dependent on decision-making as it is on pure stick skills."
"The most substantial mode is MyCareer. Here you create your own tennis pro and build them up from newcomer to champion. Your time is divided by month, and each is broken into segments for Training, Special Events, and Tournaments. Training is a mostly good setup, as you are thrust into minigames that challenge you to execute particular shots, and does a decent job refining basic skills. Special Events are one-off matches, often with a specific goal in mind, like hitting 10 target areas during the game. These can be a solid choice for XP farming, and can also unlock sponsor packages, which in turn increase the selection of the purely cosmetic items in the Pro Shop that are used to dress up your character."
"The main feature is the tournaments, where you take on other top players to battle for victory and a chance to climb the tennis ranks. There are different levels of tournaments, and gaining access to more prestigious events involves increasing your status, making your way from Unknown up to a Legend. Improving your status requires accomplishing a checklist of goals, and can contain things like winning a certain number of tournaments, successfully completing training, or working your way up the tennis ranks. The system is well-tuned and does a good job of ensuring that, by the time you are ready to take on higher-level tournaments, they are challenging but not insurmountable."
"Building XP and leveling up your character gives you points to spend for increasing your player's attributes, including speed, stamina, and reaction speed. Your maximum level is capped at 30, so you won't be able to max out every category, which is a limitation that encourages building with specific goals in mind. Boost your player's serve, forehand, and power, for example, and you'll be capable of dominating the court with overwhelming smashes, while a speed/volley combo can wreak havoc with angles and positioning. But no one player can dominate in all facets of the game."
"As you progress and win Special Events you will earn Fittings for your racket like strings or a new frame. These confer attribute bonuses on your player and come in three quality tiers, with higher tiers offering greater boosts. Hirable coaches have a similar effect, conferring boosts after completing a few on-court objectives. Together, these systems reinforce one of gaming's great unwritten rules: sports games are secretly RPGs. And in the case of Top Spin, it's a pretty good one."
"One of the key considerations comes in the form of a fatigue system that adds an interesting layer of long-term planning. Every match takes away from your player's fatigue. When it drops below a certain level, they gain the potential for a minor injury, which reduces certain attributes until it heals. If you keep playing without resting, it can lead to a major injury, sidelining you for multiple months. There's an engaging risk/reward to deciding when you can push through another event, and when you need to take a break to recuperate. After all, burning th candle at both ends for too long could mean you're forced to miss a career-defining tournament down the line."
"There's no prefabricated story mode, and I think that is for the best in this case as not all sports games need to be scripted to provide engaging drama. Top Spin does a great job creating an environment for on-court stories told through the game of tennis to shine. At one point, my player was run down after back-to-back tournaments and had just picked up a minor injury. I was all set to rest him for a month or two to recover, but then I realized Wimbledon was the next event. It was an opportunity I couldn't pass up, leading to the most challenging five rounds of matches I had played. Taking on the best players in tennis with my power game diminished by the injury meant I had to rely on subterfuge, finesse, and good old-fashioned moxie to make it to the end. Fighting through the challenges to grasp victory in a hard-fought final far exceeded any contrived storyline."
"The problem with Top Spin 2K25 is there is little to do in MyCareer other than continuing to rotate through the three monthly activities, and the threadbare presentation wears thin quickly. It doesn't take very long to develop your player far enough that you can easily win any match, at which point it really feels like you are just going through the motions over and over again, checking off objectives to increase your status and sitting at the top rank. Every tournament--from the small cup contests to the most prestigious Major--has an identical victory cutscene, with the same person giving you the exact same trophy. There's no announcing crew, and ball-tracking graphics packages like Shot Spot are used exceedingly sparingly, which is a shame. There are eventually some interesting surprise matches we won't spoil, but those are limited, and don't appear until very deep into the game."
"The options outside of MyCareer are extremely barebones. It's somewhat understandable for what effectively amounts to a fresh launch for the Top Spin series, but it stands out when other sports games, including NBA 2K, have so many more modes. Outside of MyCareer, local play is limited to list single and doubles exhibition games, and the Top Spin Academy tutorials. The latter is narrated by tennis legend John McEnroe, and while it's a good overview of how to play, it doesn't offer much value after an initial run through,"
"The online assortment isn't much better. The exhibition mode is restricted to one-on-one matchmade games. No option to play against friends or team-up with them for doubles play is a huge miss. The 2K Tour lets you play ranked games to climb a seasonal leaderboard, but the small roster of 11 men and 14 women is missing many notable athletes, including the #1 player from the men's rankings, Novak Djokovik. There also aren't any apparent rewards for placing well in the tour, leaving no clear incentive to play other than bragging rights."
"World Tour is the online competitive arena for created players. It is fun to go online and see how someone you built compares to another player's athlete, and the cat-and-mouse game on the court versus a human offers unique opportunities to use feints and other misdirections that AI-controlled players tend not to respond to. Unfortunately, this is where Top Spin's biggest sin comes most into focus as well: microtransations. The Centre Court Pass is the de facto battle pass. Thirteen of the 50 tiers are free, but the rest require you to buy the paid premium pass. That would be okay if the items were purely cosmetic, but it also contains boosters for XP, which leads to increased levels and higher attributes, as well as offering VC, the in-game currency. VC can be earned through normal gameplay, but accumulates at a slow rate. That's a problem when you are required to spend almost 3,000 VC to respec your character if you decide you want to redistribute their attribute points. You could spend hours grinding matches to make that much VC, or you could drop about $20 to get just enough points to pay for it. It's simply egregious."
"Top Spin 2K25 gets the most important piece right: It plays great. It wonderfully combines smooth and responsive gameplay with the engaging tactical aspects of tennis to create something that is a joy on the court. It's too bad the presentation is barebones and the suite of gameplay modes is limited. Ultimately though, it's the onerous microtransactions-- once again front and center in a 2K sports game--that truly hold it back and keep Top Spin 2K25 from approaching the series' former glory."
