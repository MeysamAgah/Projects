BaconEata,"yo this game is a MASTERPIECE, its really hard but death isn't as punishing as in the Dark Souls trilogy so you feel like trying again, the runbacks are most of the time short and the other longer runbacks are never too crazy, the bosses are challenging but fun to master and so are the game mechanics, the game looks really good for its great performance and size, its just the perfect game to me.",10,2025-02-27,PLAYSTATION 4,user
ArchieBalduke,Love me a rhythm game. Love a crazy prosthetic arm weapon. Best boss roster in any game I‚Äôve ever played by virtue of sheer consistent quality. Maybe like one stinker?

Beebetos,Sekiro is challenging yet fun game. it explores through the story with such great mechanics. I loved the movement in the game. Nothing was more satisfying than filling the parry bar on a boss or mini boss. The only part I didn‚Äôt like was the difficulty of the game. They make mini bosses way too strong and the dodging is not what I‚Äôm used too in similar games such as eldin ring.,9,2024-12-25,PLAYSTATION 4,user

HSuke,"The stealth and grappling parts are quite fun. I just wish they made an easier mode. I've beaten Dark Souls 1, 2, and 3, and Sekiro still owns me so hard. This basically boils down to how good you are with parrying, I mean ""deflecting"", and rhythm. The exploration is pretty forgiving, but several of the later bosses are just way too hard. Overall, I found this to be more fun than Dark Souls because of how fluid movement is, but the bosses are just so frustratingly difficult.",9,2024-11-18,PLAYSTATION 4,user

jack441,"I am huge Souls fan, I had played all From games (including Elden ring) before starting Sekiro. Many people told me that it is best Souls game. However, I do not *completely* agree. It definitely has the potential, but here is where it fell flat for me (compared to other souls games): 1. Overwhelming initial difficulty - you just start with 1 flask and a pathetic health bar and almost no tools/skills at your disposal. And it takes a while to acquire some better gear, which is most of the time acquired by defeating bosses and mini-bosses - and most of those are very challenging. In other Souls game there is always a more linear difficulty progression. So it is quite understandable why some players just give up and never finish this game. 2. Underwhelming prosthetics, skills and upgrades - while they sound good on paper, and definitely are in the early to mid game, most skills and most prosthetics are simply not worth it in the end-game. I beat the game 3 times only using 2 of dozens of combat skills - Double Ichimonji and Mortal Draw. The other skills were either too under-powered or cost too many emblems or skill point investment. Most of the prosthetics were highly situational, so again I was using mainly 2 or 3 of them. 3. Replayability - as you may heard, Sekiro is a rhythm game and if you master the rhythm of deflecting, countering and pressuring your opponent - you are going to have a great time. And you need to master it in order to defeat some of the more challenging bosses However, once you master it, there is almost no incentive to come back. In other Souls games you can always experience something new, by starting a new character build, focusing on different set of weapons and upgrades, and so on... Still, I think it is a solid game that deserves to be experienced, especially for Souls fans. The feeling of overcoming a challenging boss after two hours of dying, and later destroying him in the first try on the second play-through or gauntlet, is unmatched! However, I think I have to put the game on the last spot in my Souls-ranking, to be shared with DS2",8,2024-11-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user
kezen,"It was so close to a 10. The combat is amazing, the artstyle is beautiful, the cinematics are epic, the boss fights are almost perfect. However, it tends to repeat areas and minibosses a lot. Are the areas and minibosses cool? Yes. Are they fun to interact with? Hell yes. Do they make the game look like it's lacking in content? I guess. Also, is it just me or do the characters in this game feel flat? Some characters do show emotion, however, i feel like most characters in this game are just too stoic and cold. I get that this is probably intentional to show the mannerisms of people in Sengoku Japan, however, a bit more of personality for each character would be nice. It is just unfortunate, but I do think that its combat system and artstyle carry this game hard and it is saved from receiving a lower rating.",9,2024-11-05,PLAYSTATION 4,user

zigacesen,"I beat this game 3 times, one playthrough was charmless and demon bell. I like the game, but it has so many annoying and janky flaws that make it annoying to play. The stealth ****, steatlh deathblow works like 60% of the time, the sprint is horribly janky, the grapple hook is unresponsive, the input buffering is terrible, the camera ****, most hitboxes that arent swords are HORRIBLE, most minibosses **** or are not fun, and half of the main bosses are mediocre or just terrible. I only liked isshin SS and father owl, all other bosses are annoying to replay. didnt like the mob minibosses and the reuse of drunkard enemy. The starting of sprint animation is janky and some badly designed combat boss arenas were annoying. Could have been top 5 combat systems in any video game of all time, but it has way too many annoying flaws that are just a staple of fromsoft at this point. I only played this game because there is no other game that does this, not because its great. Its unique and a niche, not a masterpiece.

pshort420,"Out of every game I've had the pleasure of playing throughout the years I believe this is the best of the bunch. I currently have played through this title 4 times to obtain each ending and each time I felt a sense of accomplishment with every time I beat another boss. Sure, I think someone could argue there is a sense of copy and paste with some of the minibosses but I think that's a minor problem since most can be skipped if you just so happen to choose so. The combat is also flashy and rewarding since it takes true time and effort to get good at it. The DS titles usually have a way to somewhat get around having to fight a certain boss whether it be through cheesing or straight up skipping it while Sekiro makes you go one by one. This is a title truly worth picking up and playing just once. The only thing that I would add in as a negative is the fact that I feel as if I didn't use my prosthetics almost ever. It seems like quite an interesting core mechanic that maybe I didn't fully understand. Nevertheless I unlocked all of them and tended to only use the firecrackers for the Guardian Ape. This never took away from the game but just felt like a part of the game that didn't seem to have a real place within it.",10,2024-07-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user

ChessPiece01,"Sekiro is a game that has built up a reputation of being one of the most difficult games as of recent. For this exact reason is why consider my personal favourite game produced by from software. It's game that at it's core has elements of typical souls like games, mechanics such as 'bonfires', healing flasks and other similar elements that any souls fan would recognise are really put to use here with it's extremely different combat. From the beginning of the game, you'll notice these similar elements and as most people will, you will start off playing this game as you typically would a souls game. Expect, of course, the parrying mechanic. This is where I personally think serkio really shines, as you slowly play the game more you start to realise that simply dodging attacks won't cut it. Eventually, most people will hit a brick wall that is a particularly boss atop of ashina castle. This is where I, when I first played, got stuck. I was stuck into a continuous loop of death, but there is a moment where you really click with sekiros combat. The game really forces you to sit down and learn it's mechanics. Where most games are forgiving with it's combat, sekiro really pushes you to learn each bosses individual move, and the many possible ways of punishing them. The more fast pace and aggressive combat I never thought I needed. However, sekiros combat isn't just the only thing that I believe makes it from softwares best game to date. The world it's self has very stunning visuals, it makes use of the inherit beauty of Japan as occasionally youll be thrown a stunning visual of ashina. Overall, I could talk more about sekiro and what makes it my personal masterpiece, but of course this game is best experience on your own terms. The only recommendation I can give with this game is to go in blind, and of course hesitation is defeat.",10,2024-06-19,PLAYSTATION 4,user

jellyrilla,"Sekiro is probably the best game I've ever played. One of the best narrative pieces, the best gameplay loop, graphics that blew me away on my first playthrough, this game is stellar top to bottom. While I don't personally believe a video game can be ""perfect,"" Sekiro is about as close as one can come. The learning curve is the closest thing to a flaw I can find in this game. I eventually learned the gameplay loop and kind of mastered it, but it was a wildly frustrating process, and I've personally seen players quit due to the demanding combat system. Other than that nitpick there is quite literally nothing wrong with this game in my opinion. The story is a bit basic but serves this world and its characters perfectly. I love how tightknit the narrative is, rather than an overarching, in some ways uninvolved story. Every ending being wholly unique and requiring their own individual steps adds a TON to replayability, as does the extensive upgrade system. The bosses are also incredibly consistently good. Not a single boss in this game is overtly frustrating or boring in my opinion. They all had a unique moveset that was fun to learn and overcome, and also all visually impressed me time after time. Sekiro isn't my FAVORITE game ever per se, but it is top down the closest I've seen to perfection.",10,2024-06-10,PLAYSTATION 4,user

drlowdon,"Sekiro‚Äôs combat system is amongst the best in gaming and the excellent stealth and traversal systems are equally as good. Even when compared to other From Software games however, this game is punishingly difficult and without co-op or the ability to level up your character there are multiple points at which the challenge will be insurmountable for many players. Sekiro‚Äôs quality is undeniable, but personally I feel it would have been a more enjoyable experience if the difficulty was just toned down a notch or two.",8,2024-05-02,PLAYSTATION 4,user

I am not that bad myself, I played a hella lot of games but sekiro its just unplayable to me because of the difficulty so I cannot give anything else other than 0 for a game that I cannot play. I really don't want to undermine anyone's enjoyment with this game, maybe it's just my skill issue but I honestly believe that this is a fundamentally bad game, one that is not investing in the concept of having fun but on being punished for your own existence, a game that tries to make you pity yourself for how unskilled and pathetic you are.

Just by playing the first couple of hours, you can instantly recognize it's a FromSoft game but they changed and added so many features from the Souls series that it genuinely feels like something new. The best example is how the combat system differs from the Souls games, being more about countering your enemy repeatedly than cheesing it. It might be a bit rough during the beginning before the combat clicks for you but when that combat clicks it truly becomes a unique experience.

I love the utter, unabashed Japanese-ness of this game -- I truly do. It just, so unfortunately, ****. It ****. And that makes me sad. It is a game that robs you of options on how to play. There is also zero payoff to killing bosses -- there's more of a ""good riddance"" feeling, rather than a ""good battle"" feeling after killing a boss that you've been bashing your head against the wall trying to eliminate for days. I hate the control scheme as well. I hate how repetitive it is, and I hate that it actively tries to punish you for dying. The Souls formula (and yes, I am going to relate it to the other ones, because they introduce the same dying mechanic, so I am going to criticize how they erred on it in this one) is perverted greatly by actively punishing you by dying more and more. It was a bad mechanic in DS2, and it was a bad mechanic in Demon's Souls.

DigiConnoiseur,"Sekiro is a testament to exceptional gameplay, particularly evident in its combat system. The focus on precision and mastery sets it apart, offering a fast-paced, intense, and deeply satisfying experience. FromSoftware's refinement of Dark Souls' combat system shines through, with Sekiro's combat feeling like a dance of blade and reflex. Unlike traditional RPGs where progression hinges on character upgrades, Sekiro's progression is rooted in player skill. Mastery of Wolf's trusty katana, Kusabimaru, is paramount, allowing for creative approaches to encounters. Whether employing stealth and Ninjutsu techniques or unleashing Combat Arts alongside Prosthetic Tools, every encounter feels dynamic and purposeful. Graphics uphold the game's immersive atmosphere, blending gritty realism based on Japan's Sengoku era with fantastical elements inspired by Japanese mythology. While the story takes a backseat to gameplay, it provides a solid backdrop enriched by memorable characters and voice acting. Traversal is fluid and agile, mirroring the grace of combat. Wolf's mobility, including wall-jumping and grappling, adds depth to exploration, opening up verticality and strategic advantages. Level design, though linear, is meticulously crafted, offering branching paths and varied environments. While enemy variety is generally satisfying, certain areas may feel lacking in diversity, impacting the overall experience. Boss fights stand as the pinnacle of Sekiro's design, offering thrilling encounters that demand skill and adaptation. Each boss presents a unique challenge, with movesets mirroring those of regular enemies encountered throughout the game. The crescendo of techniques and strategies learned throughout the journey culminates in a gratifying finale. Despite its relatively shorter length compared to other FromSoftware titles, Sekiro's concentrated content ensures a rich and fulfilling experience. Overall, Sekiro emerges as a standout masterpiece, showcasing FromSoftware's prowess in game design. With its emphasis on skill-based gameplay and meticulous attention to detail, Sekiro earns a well-deserved rating of 9.8/10.",10,2024-04-04,PLAYSTATION 4,user

cdsmith7,"Sekiro's combat is innovative, rewarding and has a steep learning curve. The world is detailed with elaborate layouts. Standard enemies and bosses are a joy to fight. The story was surprisingly not a cryptic mess but quite easy to follow. The reason I place this game below DS3 and Bloodborne is that several RPG elements have been removed. There are a variety of skills, prosthetics and consumables but you cannot customize character build, or loot armor and traditional weapons. You do get the mortal blade which is similar to Rivers of Blood, but aside from that you will not be fighting with different swords or other weapon types like spears, axes or clubs. Shrines next to bosses make the fights enjoyable but mini bosses, which are often more challenging, may have dozens of enemies you must mind numbingly kill every time you want to practice a fight. FromSoftware, as expected, has made a great game. I just don't see the replay value as being on par with DS3 and certainly not Bloodborne.",8,2020-03-31,PLAYSTATION 4,user

BaakaMeechy,"This game is my Nindo, my ninja way. This was my first fromsoft title I played to completion (4 times for all endings). I feel like a major roadblock to soulsborne, along with the difficulty, is the generally slow pace at which the games take place. Sometimes you need to take out areas one enemy at a time and movement in souls games had been basically the same throughout the franchise. Sekiro dialed speed to 11 and switched guard for parry. As a ninja with a customizable prosthetic tool, a sword, and a lord to save, you quickly leap into action and start kicking major ass. Words fail to describe how good it feels to parry an enemy and then deliver a fatal blow. Characters are cool and the story is more streamlined and easy to follow (at times) than other souls games. Biggest gripe with the game is lack of expansions.",10,2023-12-01,PLAYSTATION 4,user
flying_leaves,"I spent two days with this game. I tried to beat one enemy, an ogre, at least 15 times. It reminded me of Sigrun in God of War, but in that case, there was an easy mode option, which this game doesn't provide. I realised I was just wasting my time - and importantly, having no fun at all. Based on what I saw, I think that the developers deliberately made the bosses almost impossibly difficult to hide the lack of content in the game. Their refusal to include an easy mode in an update seems to confirm this. It occurred to me quite early on that without the difficulty of the fights, the game wouldn't contain much, and this would become very obvious with an easy mode. Compared to other games, the cutscenes are lifeless and the visuals are unimpressive. As for the story, I still don't actually know what I was supposed to be doing, as there wasn't any clear objective. I'm not a programmer, but I assume that the amount of health you lose when you get hit will be defined by a single parameter - a number in a line of code. Likewise for the amount of damage you inflict on an enemy. These parameters are chosen at will by a group of developers in an office somewhere in Japan. So to waste literally days trying to beat a virtual enemy, fighting him again and again and again, would be to become a slave to the whims of those developers. It wouldn't be an achievement - not to me anyway. At the very least, this game was an eye-opener. It shows how a studio can make players think they are playing an amazing game simply by making fights impossibly difficult.

sajalhsn13,"""Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice"" is a masterpiece in the world of samurai and shinobi games. It offers a unique combat system that sets it apart from others. The world, enemies, and bosses are among the toughest you'll face, but the game is balanced, making victories satisfying. The sound of deflection is music to the ears, keeping you engaged. While you only wield a single sword, the prosthetic tools provide variety and excitement. ""Sekiro"" is a 10/10 experience that delivers a perfect blend of challenge and reward, making it a must-play for gamers.",10,2023-11-07,PLAYSTATION 4,user

FuriousAegon,"Sekiro : Shadows Die Twice is my second favorite FromSoft game since **** main thing of thing that differs this game from other FromSoft game is actual plot and decent **** plot is simple, but u can also empathize lots of characters like Kuro, Sekiro, Emma , Owl, Isshin ( before his boss appearance ) these all very interesting characters by their lore and impact to the story.Also the story endings of this game are far more dramatic than from other souls **** me gameplay of this game is the best thing that FromSoftware ever produced.Very aggressive, fast, and requires skill from player to successfully parry and remember move set of boss.There‚Äôs only one minus for me in this gameplay - when face a really hard boss like Isshin ( both as Sword Saint and Ashina ), Owl ( Father ), Genichoro , True Monk the one and only 100% way to kill them is to remember their move set and increase their posture by parrying their attacks that you can‚Äôt do without move set knowledge, and in this situation skill won‚Äôt help‚Ä¶There‚Äôs tons of good bosses in this game Isshin (both variations), Owl (Father), Divine Dragon, Guardian Ape, Genichoro Ashina, Lady Butterfly, Demon of Hatred these are the shining expanse of perfect boss **** Father and Isshin Sword Saint are in my top 5 favorite bosses of all **** fight against them is feels dramatic because of the plot and **** example from fight versus Owl Father is really intense because you already fought your father, but now he‚Äôs from the past and even stronger, also music intensives your feelings of fight and you can feel fury of Owl and Sekiro in this **** about Isshin, of course he is the hardest boss in the game, and I spent about 50-60 attempts to beat him in my first play trough, but now I beat him in most cases without taking any **** I mastered this fight, but it was a huge struggle to learn his move set and trying to beat him for 1,5 days. Most of the locations of this game are gorgeous and level-designed **** only location I don‚Äôt like is Sunken Valley it is very boring and poor on content, also comparing with good locations like Senior Temple,Ashina Castle & Outskirts ,Hirata Estate.Also Fountained Palace is the most beautiful location of the game, but it has really stupid enemies like monks that drain your life ; Monks-Knights/Archers/ they are annoying as hell but in other aspects this location is good.After getting platinum and spending around ~150 hours in the game I can clearly say that if you‚Äôve played dark souls or Bloodborne it is worth trying out, you might not enjoy the combat system or lore & story, but I think everyone would enjoy these incredible boss **** as my 2nd favorite FromSoft game and Top 10 in my Favorite Games list i think it deserves 9.5/10.Hesitation is defeat‚Ä¶",9,2022-04-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Santa01003,"A great rhythm game. From software did something monstrous creating Sekiro's combat system, so much so that many games have taken inspiration from or sometimes copied the aforementioned development house. We are talking about the best souls from an objective point of view, certainly the one most based on the player's skill and the most honest towards him(let's be clear, in software games you don't always die through your own fault and the road to the boss of the moment is often frustrating given the heaviness conveyed by the slowness of the character and the long path littered with annoying minions. In this case, however, the grappling hook and the speed of the protagonist make everything more immediate and satisfying). Only on the auditory level did I find some problems, for example in situations where enemies are eavesdropped the sound is unrealistically muffled, considering that you are often just a few meters away from them. All bosses can be learned and you always get to the point of knowing them enough to beat them without a scratch, apart from the Demon of Hatred, that i fuond totally out of place in context of Sekiro. Another flaw found is the input lag, certainly not game breaking but rather limiting at the beginning",9,2023-10-25,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Zski,"To start with my history with Souls games. I never liked any of them, at all, until Elden Ring, which I absolutely loved. I read that the next most accessible game is Sekiro, so after my great experience with Elden Ring, I decided to give this one a shot. I‚Äôll start with the positives. The story/lore is a bit confusing but highly intriguing. Since I now understand how the story works in these games, I can appreciate what is being presented, especially since it‚Äôs a bit more active story telling compared to Elden Ring. The way they weave the story and lore into the atmosphere of the game is excellent, which really plays into the overall presentation of the setting. The graphics are very good, although nothing memorable. Mix that with a soundtrack that does the job exceptionally well despite not being memorable in any way, and it‚Äôs a great feeling game. My issue, as it always was with Souls games, is the combat. I‚Äôm still having the same experience I always had with these games where I feel that the control of the character is just too loose. The slightest movement of the stick makes your character completely pivot all over the place, luckily the lock on mechanic makes it feel a little more grounded, but I hate to say it, the control of the character feels cheap. It almost feels dated, like a PS2 era game. I thought the hookshot and the prosthetic weapons work well and really enhance maneuverability compared to other games I played, but when that‚Äôs combined with the floaty controls, it feels like you have no weight in any of your actions. So I have mixed feelings about it - the maneuverability makes it feel more action based, which ironically sets up the stealth, but the way you‚Äôre forced to use it makes it lame. Maybe I‚Äôm not understanding, but the 1 on 1 fights are fun, it can be fun learning the patterns. Despite dying over and over, those segments were fun enough to give me that feeling where I knew what I did wrong, and immediately go into trying the fight again. But when there are more than one enemy present, the combat completely falls apart. It just feels like you back up a little, isolate an enemy and damage them a little bit until the group catches up, back up a little, isolate an enemy, then rinse wash and repeat. After about 6 hours with the game, I find that it‚Äôs time for me to put the game down. It has its moments, but I find that I spend a lot of mental energy convincing myself that it‚Äôs not that bad. If I spend most of my time with a game convincing myself that I‚Äôm having fun, it‚Äôs not really that fun. I can see how people enjoy it, but it‚Äôs just not for me. I gave it my best, and the weird loose grip of the character and floaty movement combined with decent combat made it hard to feel like I care enough to go on.",6,2023-10-10,PLAYSTATION 4,user

agendafu,"Title: A Soulslike Triumph of Perseverance - 10/10 Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is the epitome of a Soulslike experience, and it revels in the unrelenting suffering that comes with each encounter. FromSoftware, the studio renowned for its challenging and immersive titles, has crafted a masterpiece that embraces the essence of the Soulslike genre, demanding players to endure countless trials and tribulations. As an ardent fan of their previous works, I came to Sekiro with high expectations, and it not only met but far exceeded them. 1. Unforgiving Combat Mastery (10/10) Sekiro's combat system is a relentless and unforgiving test of one's mettle. It's a dance of death that demands precision, timing, and tactical brilliance with each strike. The posture system, a departure from traditional health bars, intensifies the suffering, rewarding players who can perfectly parry, deflect, and break their foes' posture for the exhilarating coup de gr√¢ce. Every enemy is a harsh teacher, a puzzle to be solved with every encounter, where a single misstep can lead to agonizing defeat after agonizing defeat. 2. A World Steeped in Desolation (10/10) Sekiro masterfully crafts an atmospheric rendition of Japan's Sengoku era, invoking a sense of desolation and melancholy. From the crumbling Ashina Castle to the ominous depths of the Sunken Valley, the game's world is painstakingly detailed, hiding secrets around every corner. Level design, a hallmark of FromSoftware, is a labyrinthine masterpiece, intertwining paths that encourage exploration and discovery. The attention to detail immerses players in a world teeming with sorrow and peril. 3. The Agony of Storytelling (10/10) Sekiro's narrative is a gripping journey filled with morally complex characters, where suffering and vengeance are the central themes. The story delves into questions of honor, loyalty, and the harrowing price of retribution. The silent protagonist, Wolf, compels players to wrestle with their emotions, and his relentless journey will haunt players long after the controller is set aside. 4. Aesthetic Torture (10/10) Sekiro's visuals and audio are an exercise in tormenting beauty. Environments are exquisitely rendered, characters pulsate with raw emotion, and the haunting soundtrack, composed by Yuka Kitamura, gnaws at your soul, amplifying the game's somber atmosphere. Sekiro's artistic direction pushes the boundaries of visual and auditory artistry, plunging players into a world where suffering and beauty coexist. 5. Excruciating Boss Encounters (10/10) Sekiro's bosses stand as monuments of anguish and triumph, embodying the very essence of the Soulslike genre. They are punishing and unrelenting, designed to push players to the brink of despair. Each boss requires meticulous strategy and demands patience, making each victory a euphoric release of frustration after numerous, agonizing attempts. Whether facing the towering Guardian Ape, the enigmatic Owl, or the relentless Genichiro, the road to success is paved with suffering, making each triumph that much sweeter. In summary, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is a testament to the Soulslike genre, a relentless trial of skill and perseverance that few games can match. FromSoftware has crafted an experience that revels in the player's suffering, a symphony of agony and ecstasy. If you seek a gaming journey that will test your resolve, Sekiro is the crucible where your determination will be forged anew with every grueling encounter. Surrender to the brutal beauty of this masterpiece, and prepare to die countless times on your path to glory.",10,2023-09-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user

CnPx98,"Must have been a dry year for games for this to get game of the year. It's just got so many hateable aspects for what could have been a much better game. Bossing in this game just isn't that fun. They go on for a boringly long time and it's the same from start to finish. Remnants weren't their at launch at so people just turn them off. This leaves you with empty remnants of people just running round in a circle as if they were trying to work out what it does. You mite get the odd useful one but you'll skip over these because you have to select loads of useless ones to find the useful ones. By then you can just work out where it would take you anyway. Crosses what restore the prosthetic arm are a bootable and not restoring with the bonfire is stupid. Healing items in this game are basically non existent and it relies more on not getting hit at all. Which is fine but getting hit once by a boss is either 1 or 2 hit death. Basically making this game a 0 room for error type deal. Again this would be fine if every boss instance was just a boss but 10 enemies aswell. Some ranged, melee, boss charging at you. But your ranged attack is basically like throwing marshmallows. I've completed a few of From Softs souls games and sekiro is not really souls bourne but it's still difficult. But I find the difficulty in Sekiro more of an unfair kind. Stealth keeps breaking. You get a backstab indicator but il go to press it when it's on and il just them with my sword alerting everyone. Enemies follow you when they didn't see you go there rather then following the route you took. Say I run round a building threw some bushes and grapple onto a tree. They will skip over everything and lock onto where I am. Like how they know that? It's really immersion breaking. Or you kill an enemy 5 miles away in a noisy area and everyone will turn around and look at you? They will walk over their best mates dead corps like meh there goes another one. Why they not go into a search mode? For a game that revolves around stealth there isn't very much stealth options and the stealth is terrible. The skill tree **** and has nothing interesting out of the 10 things on it. The map design feels extremely fake and un-interesting. It's like an extremely long and narrow cliff everywhere you go in this game. Its like 10 steps to the left is 1 side and to the right is the other side. For a from software game there is literally 0 exploration. Sometimes you'll get the odd jump down onto platform area and that's about it. Think in Demon Souls or Dark souls 1 all the shortcuts leading back to the bonfire and it's awesome to see how the map felt like a giant spider web. Nope Sekiro is just 1 narrow path everywhere. Sekiro is great for is the story. But that's to be expected with these devs. And the core combat is pretty good outside of stealth and most bosses. I also love the way how everyone in the world is there for a reason. This is something From have always done that's awesome. No one just ignores you. I just felt the game could have used a little more polish in certain areas but I would imagine Activision being the publishers they had strict deadlines and had to have a meeting about what colour an NPCs clothes were. From Software have never gone back to them since so I'm guessing Bandai Namco is better to work with.",7,2023-08-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user

PJMZdanowski,"Amazing game! My story with Sekiro is complicated. I bought it when it won GOTY but I played for maybe 2 hours and sold the game. It seemed brutal and not well designed. Some time later with PS5 I bought Demon Souls for launch. I played the **** out of it. It's a beautiful remake if you haven't played it. I went through most of the game, I advanced much more then the first time I played it on PS3. I think it because of the fact the loadings are so much faster now, so when you die you don't have to go and make a tea, before you can jump right back. Still did not finish it, because I was distracted by Returnal. OMG Returnal is perfect. Mind bending SF lore and hard fights that made my heart pumping adrenaline like nothing before... and then there was Elden Ring. By that time Returnal made me thirsty for a challange, so Elden Ring was excellent. Zelda like exploration, but better??? How is it even possible!? You stumble on to the lift and you spend next 3 days killing Dragon God who lives under the monster-ant kingdom in a long forgotten underground human civilnization. Amazing! And hard fights! Emotions so powerful, impossible really to describe. Once it ended I had to finish Demon Souls, which suddenly became extremely easy:) Once I got back to it, not only I killed the boss I was stuck on in second try... I basically sprinted through the rest of the game almost without dying. The final boss I got on my first try:) I got gud ;) Then Jedi Knight quickly which gave me a fix of FS... and Kena that contrary to her looks is a challenge with some bosses.... but I needed more... so I bought Dark Souls Trilogy... :D DS1 - cool, but to old... I will probably finish it after Sekiro... where I'm going... But DS3? This is the next level **** Great bosses, better then ER and really good graphics and fluency in 60fps. Loved it! I tried Bloodborne... it's ok but too old and clunky... same with DS2 - clunky as hell, actually looks worse then DS1 remaster... so after DS3 and all it's DLCs I bought Sekiro again, because many people say it's the best FS game... What can I say? iI you read all the way to this worlds and your journey and tastes, at least partially, align... then I think you will be enchanted by it. It's not that hard and you will have a blast with exploration, rythmic combat and cool lore. It's all so nicely packed into so many cool and tight mechanics... and there so cool secrets and suprises along the way... even the smallest details are really cool.

hazukimio,"Sekiro: Shadow Die Twice is the least soul-like game FromSoftware had developed. Being different from other soul-like games based on defense, counterattack, and dodging enemy skills, Sekiro encourages players to be offensive. With the flawless art design and the pleasure when you collide your blades with enemies, Sekiro is FromSoftware's best interpretation of the charm of Japan's Sengoku period. But at the same time, Sekiro doesn't have as much depth in the combat system like other soul-like game with a wider choice of weapons and genres, such as Dark Souls and Elden Ring. This, along with the overall slightly insufficient volume, is one of Sekiro's few drawbacks. However, I have to admit that these defects could be very personal. That is to say, Sekiro is a good game, but not a perfect one for me.",8,2023-07-04,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Haven't you wanted, after beating a souls fight against the bosses again Astorias, Ornsteinn & Smough, Sir Alonne, GAEL??? In Sekiro you can (+ you unlock character skins that are sick af and new abilities). The only bad thing may be it's difficulty (that difficulty is based on your skills 100%) for some players, but when you start understanding the parry and all other abilities, this game becomes a river, and you, you are JESUS. You start flowing with the bosses and you cum with every parry vs 2nd & 3rd fase Isshin.

Harvo,"After 80 hours, I can confirm this game is NOT a masterpiece. It‚Äôs great but it has its issues that the usual brown-nosing FromSoftware fanboys won‚Äôt address. First off, play this game on the PS5 or a good PC or don‚Äôt play it all. The game is such a slow, choppy technical disaster on the PS4 that I CANNOT recommend it for the PS4 at all. Your lucky if the frame rate hits 25fps. The input delay is far too long, literally takes a second for a button to register(completely unacceptable since ALOT of enemies can kill you in a half a second). Sometimes, the buttons don‚Äôt even register at all.I never realized how much of an issue this was until I got a PS5; honestly, this game would‚Äôve been better off as a next-gen exclusive. The positive side is that the combat is one of a kind. Lots of replayability. Interesting enemies and locations. Great music.

Ginger_Avenger,"OK - It's a departure from the usual by Miyazaki- I get some people's disappointment. I love this game, and it's certainly not perfect, nor is it perhaps as replayable as the Souls games, but I understood from the start that It's an action game, not really an action RPG. Also, concerning one of its most talked about features: maybe I have just improved at this type of game in recent years, but I feel like there is a bit too much exaggeration about the game difficulty- it seems like some people were not adapting to the fight style available, and that might have added to the challenge and frustration. You have the one weapon, a few handfuls of skills, items, and tools, and that's it. It's the same familiar experience from From (see what I did there?) of getting better and surmounting the seemingly impossible, just with only one specific character build and fighting style. I liked the focus on deflect and posture as it allows two ways to defeat enemies, draining their life bar or filling their posture damage bar. If you don't like to deflect, then maybe you will not enjoy this game as much as I did, but it's an oversimplification to say that the game is only about deflecting as that strategy will not really work on some bosses (anyway, there is the usual cheese available for a lot of them). I also generally liked the addition of the stealth mechanics and also grappling hook and more vertical design of many levels. And the world of the game is very beautiful and well designed. Overall, I prefer the non-Souls From Soft games like this and Bloodborne and I didn't try this wanting to play Dark Souls in Sengoku Japan. Sekiro is its own type of game, and gave me mostly great fights and a decent challenge. Like any From Soft game, I feel there are some lower tier boss battles, so there were a couple of true peak and valley moments where a great and fun boss was followed soon after by a mini boss or boss that was head scratching or made obnoxious by an unreliable camera in closed quarters. Bloodborne is still the king of the From games for me, but this game often came close to taking that crown.",9,2023-05-07,PLAYSTATION 4,user

It is easily one of the greatest games I have ever played. Sure the first run was a bit difficult when I was still learning the ropes but after I learned all the tricks it just clicked with me. If people say it is hard and unfair I have to say that they gave up too soon before learning the combat. Soulslike genre isn't for the faint-hearted. One huge difference it has compared to other soulslikes is the fact that you must unlearn most of what you've learned during other soulslikes and approach this game from a new perspective. The new posture mechanic instead of stamina and deflecting mechanic. The only problem I had with the game is that some of the bosses are used more than once during a playthrough. And it gets boring during multiple playthroughs. Overall, it was one hell of an experience. 10/10",10,2023-04-11,PLAYSTATION 4,user

sickfabe06,"I mean, what can I say... Arguably the greatest FromSoftware game ever made, and one of the greatest, if not THE greatest game ever released in the history. The combat system is flawless, very very satisfying, the absence of stamina is a great idea, because it helps you to keep your head fully focused on your enemy, and less focused on yourself. The removal of level-upgrading is the thing that makes this game drive away from the Souls saga, and I personally LOVE IT. Now it's not your character that is getting better, but YOU are actually getting better! The movement system is great and it fits perfectly with the game, because your character can be moved in a very quick manner, and the agility is one of the most important skills that a Shinobi has to have. Also the possibility to resurrect is a fantastic feature in my opinion. And finally, the last boss is probably the best boss I ever fought against. I'm not giving it a 10, because there are still some annoying bosses, some bosses that you need to buff yourself to be able to have a chance to beat, and 1 thing that FromSoftware needs to understand, and I'm not talking only about sekiro, but every souls game: When I am healing, I must be untouchable just for those 2 seconds !!! Bosses often wait for you to heal to attack, because your character is busy doing that animation and they can hit, and you obviously can't do anything to avoid it (and if I'm healing, I do it to gain some hp, not to loose even more",9,2023-01-31,PLAYSTATION 4,user

80sChild,"I don't get the love for this game. It's definitely broken, but its received with praise as a ""challenging FromSoft game"" from gaming's worst developer: Hidetaka Miyazaki. If you think challenge = gimping the player by making enemies op and the player attacks hit like a water balloon, then yes its very ""challenging"". Lets be honest: without the artificial difficulty, the game would probably be 4-8 hours long, its the same **** tactic Miyazaki always uses to squeeze blood from a penny. The media and their sheep-like followers praise his games but look at the achievements on ANY platform: 10-20% completion rate for ANY game he makes. BeSt GaMe EvA! Enemies (all of them) rotate on invisible lazy susans to track you when you use dodge (making dodge pointless). Archers fire arrows that clearly change course (in the air! Lol) to track you. Enemies rarely react to being hit and their attacks can seldom be interrupted. Theres a specific move you can get for ""crowds"", I have yet to use it without an enemy interrupting it (and ignoring the move itself). Old, broken and poorly designed combat system lends to the games ""difficulty"" as you can really only engage in one on one scenarios. Camera system is horrendous is tight areas. Stealth isn't stealthy as enemies are always alerted when you perform a ""stealth"" attack. Its an old, outdated, broken design that is inexplicably excused away as ""challenging"", in almost all From games. More modern, polished games like Ghost of Tsushima allow the player to take on upwards of 20 enemies at once with combat systems that function properly. If you like broken, poorly designed games because they're ""difficult"" where said ""difficulty"" only exists to hide the lack of actual content: This is your game.",0,2022-12-11,PLAYSTATION 4,user

MaxPayneIsGod,"As a veteran and fan of the SoulsBorne games it was natural that I give Sekiro a shot. Most of what I played I enjoyed, the style, stealth, combat and graphics are excellent. The truth is I just couldn't get into it. I'm burnt out on this type of game, the brutal difficulty, respawning enemies, learning patterns and ambiguous game mechanics I've poured 100s of hours into Nioh, Souls 1 and 2, and Bloodborne, I don't get pleasure out of this type of game any more. The continual grind, dying over and over doesn't appeal to me. I simply don't have time for it. I can't do it any more. When I get a chance to game I want to relax and get immersed in characters and story, none of which are Sekiro's strong points.",6,2022-11-22,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Ic3_winterhell,"Sekiro es una combinaci√≥n entre shinobi, Onimusha y un Souls, si has jugado esas franquicias imagina una mezcla de ambos y el core de los souls(con todo y su dificultad elevada), aunque tiene mas de los souls que los otros juegos. En cuanto el combate, en este juego es fundamental cubrir y hacer parrys a diferencia de bloodborne o darksouls que puedes abordar las peleas esquivando ataques, cosa que en sekiro solo sirve para un tipo de ataque enemigo. En su contra puedo decir que es mucho menos variado que un darksouls, solo cuentas con un arma en casi todo el juego y tienes una pr√≥tesis que sirven como arma secundaria, pero lo anterior es muy poco a diferencia de todas las combinaciones que podr√≠as hacer en un souls Algo muy positivo de este juego, es que te cuenta la historia de una manera mas clara que los dem√°s juegos de Fromsoftware, al tener un personaje predeterminado, tu personaje no se siente como un hueco de DS si no como un verdadero shinobi con sentimientos e intereses. Lo anterior puede ser positivo o negativo dependiendo de lo que est√©s buscando. En lo que si se lleva un 10 es en la exploraci√≥n, donde al igual que DS1 sus mundos est√°n interceptados y se siente muy bien el ir descubriendo los √≠dolos (Hogueras de descanso) pero va mas all√°, con su sistema de Gancho salto y sigilo, con lo anterior puedes abandonar una pelea si te sientes superado y escapar para despues esconderte (algo como Assasins creed combinado con metal gear). Lo anterior hace que te dientas muy agil por los escenarios y no como en una ratonera como en DS o Bloodborne. En cuanto al sistema de progresi√≥n las cosas son muy distintas a DS, ya que no tienes estad√≠sticas solo puedes subir el nivel de ataque, la salud, el da√±o a la postura y la cantidad y calidad de tus curaciones. Las resistencias al veneno, miedo y dem√°s estad√≠sticas se compensan con consumibles que te dan o puedes comprar y que te suben est√°s resistencias. En General es de aplaudir que Fromsoftware adapta su formula con otros tipos de Gameplays, algo solo Nioh ha podido hacer bien, sin embargo hay decenas de juegos como Lords of the fallen, the surge y dem√°s que han fallado en el intento.

mrwarcriminal,"Ok. WOW! What a fantastic game. There‚Äôs only a few game series I play as soon as they release. Dead Space, God of War, many of the Lego Games & now From Software games. Bloodborne was my first & after that i started playing the backed up games. Dark Souls, DSIII, didn‚Äôt like DSII then Elden Ring & recently Sekiro. At first it‚Äôs incredibly difficult. I played through the game twice before becoming what I would consider to be proficient. If you want to cheese many bosses there are ways but that is cheating yourself out of a lot of satisfaction & fun. The game can be finished w/4 endings. One ending is about 60% if the full game the typical ending is about 95% of the game. There‚Äôs a lot of fighting techniques Sekiro can learn to make fights more difficult, easy, interesting & easy. Attack power is upgraded after defeating major bosses & using the memory to upgrade. So grinding for attack power doesn‚Äôt work. You have to learn the fight. Maybe a skill can help & that can be a grind objective; along w/Sen (gold). A very different From Software game that feels right at home because of the excellent boss, character, level & fight designs. I do think Sekiro is the most difficult From Software game I‚Äôve played but it‚Äôs fair & that‚Äôs most important. Don‚Äôt skip this game & if you do play don‚Äôt give up.

Timenick,"This game was a huge disappointment for me at launch and it has only gotten worse after I played Elden Ring. Sekiro is japanese Dark Souls but most of the good stuff is gone. - Worst customization of the series, because there isnt any. - Worst gameplay of the series. Fromsoftware can make games with a hundred weapons that all feel great, so if they make a game with just one weapon it would result in absolutely god tier gameplay, right? No. Its just one dimensional Katana bashing all the time and nothing else. Not really better than using a Katana in all their other games. Gets boring after the first few areas. Also it straight up doesnt work when fighting multiple enemies at once and all the other minor problems these games have (bad camera, weird hit boxes etc) are still there. - Worst online of the series because there isnt any as well. No coop, no pvp, nothing. - Worst overall content of the series, most bosses and all mini bosses and even some areas get reused multiple times. 3x Ashina castle, really? This is lazy. All the other Souls games have way more content and Elden Ring is probably ten times bigger than Sekiro. - Besides that its not better than the other games at anything. Bloodborne and DS3 still have the same or even better overall quality than Sekiro and ER and the Demon¬¥s Souls Remake absolutely dunk on it. If Elden Ring is a $60 game Sekiro would be $5. Good that Fromsoftware got away from this misguided garbage.",4,2022-08-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user

BobsityJonesity,"Sekiro has possibly the most fun combat mechanics out of any game I have ever played. There's not a moment of boredom while fighting enemies or bosses, and every hit feels satisfactory. Since the game is a fromsoft title, it takes a while to get adjusted, but the game does a fantastic job at slowly getting one used to the blocking and dodging mechanics. The movement system also combines seamlessly with the rest of the gameplay. The locations are interesting to explore and there are enough set pieces here to emphasize the beauty of the world they created. The bosses in this game too are easily the most consistently great in any game I've ever played. The fighting mechanics allow for interesting and challenging fights which really shine brightest with the final fight. A substantial issue I have however is that there are a decent amount of repeat fights here. almost half the bosses and mini-bosses one fights are repeats with some alterations. Now, while the alterations often do change enough to make the second fights compelling, it still feels odd that in a game this polished there also exists a stunning lack of diversity. But, the high points of this game heavily outweigh the negatives and overall one likely wont be too concerned with the lack of diversity of fights while playing due to the fluid and great feeling gameplay that surrounds it.",9,2022-08-20,PLAYSTATION 4,user
9bb,"Finally from-software tries something new again! This review is from the perspective of a returning souls player that have played ds1 ds3 bloodbourne and demon souls. The new combat is a new welcome addition. The new movement and vertical level designs makes for a new Experience that doesn‚Äôt feel like from soft is treading similitude ground. If you are a returning souls player that wants exactly the same experience you might be put of because it is different. The customized build variety has been traded for a more focused and simply put much better combat system. This is a game that knows what it wants to accomplish and does so very well. I do have a few minor very subjective complaints though. The world feels less very inspired but still a bit less creative and surprising than previous world entries. But this is because it is more reality based and that‚Äôs okay, just personal preference. The pop up tutorial systems are a steep downgrade from previous game tutorials. I will also say that the amount of repeat minibosses are tedious. And that the ability to absorb coins and items although conviniant is very immersion breaking. Also the GODAMM MONKEY DUO FIGHT IS THE WORST IN THE ENTIRE SERIES. I don‚Äôt ever wanna hear anymore complaints about ‚ÄúOh the ds2 duo bosses are the worst‚Äù because goddam this is the worst duo fight ever it does not work and abandons everything this game was built around. 1v1, this was also abit true for games like ds1 but since the combat system was less focused and somewhat less built around 1v1 you could make it justifiable to create 2v1 fights. Not in sekiro though. Still I am very happy to see fromsoft get out of their comfort zone and try something new. Heavily recommended",9,2022-08-06,PLAYSTATION 4,user

amechudo,"A masterpiece! As long as you leave your gaming preconceptions at the door, and open yourself to the combat mechanics that From Software carefully crafted on this title, you will have a blast! Initially, I tried to play this game with my usual approach: keep dodging, have patience, mind your position, and look for an opening to punish your adversary‚Ä¶ And doing this just brought me pain, anger and frustration‚Ä¶ I kept dying and dying and dying. I did not understand what was happening! Sekiro took me out of my comfort zone, and forced me to change the way I usually approach games like this‚Ä¶ I had to be aggressive, set the tempo of the fight, and properly learn and rely on new or rarely used mechanics‚Ä¶ And it was a wonderful experience. It is funny how as soon as you embrace Sekiro‚Äôs combat system, everything clicks. You really feel like a ninja, dominating parries, mikiri counters, and jumps, while also throwing yourself right in the face of bosses and dominating them‚Ä¶ At some point you feel that is the boss the one that should be worried because you are unstoppable! Less flexibility is the price to pay to have such a refined combat experience. Thank you From Software for pushing the genre and bringing such unique experiences for us to enjoy. Have patience, learn the mechanics, and be aggressive‚Ä¶ And you will have a wonderful time with Sekiro.",10,2022-06-16,PLAYSTATION 4,user

They modified the game style that existed in the previous games, and that they went back to in Elden Ring which should tell you something. They gave you a ton of options while roaming the general map but all your boss fights are the same. You are locked into a parry combat style which make boss fights maddeningly long compared to any other souls title because you arent really able to innovate, which is where my disappointment lies. Almost all the boss fights feel the same and are unnecessary long.",3,2022-06-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The combat system is so unique, innovative and brilliantly carried out that for me even the very high difficulty doesn't affect the joy of fighting in a bad way. On the contrary, the difficulty forces you the internalize the art of fighting like a shinobi and adds to the feeling. With this combat system I always felt like I have the abilities to defeat my opponents, I was sure through hard work I will gather the skills to succeed even in the hardest fights. Unlike some bosses in the Dark Souls games, Sekiro always gave me the faith and confidence that I will overcome the challenge I am facing.

Dperks,"I really hated this game at first. I felt that it was extremely difficult and unfair and really hard to just get a grasp of how to play the game. But I kept playing and eventually it clicked and now I'm in love with this game. I like many people came into this expecting a souls like game but instead its more of a character action, stealth game that burrows a lot of ideas from dark souls. Instead of making your own character there only one character Wolf and with the lack of customization to play styles there usually a right way to play the game and because of that I feel this hurts the replay value when compared to the souls games. But its kind of unfair for us to keep comparing this to Dark Souls because this game is trying to be something else and it does a damn good job at it. While things like checkpoints, death mechanics and brutal difficulty are carried over from FromSoft's other games this one has a more stealth and one on one dual focus to it. And while the game is quite difficult it felt really rewarding to master and combat is just really fun once you get the hang of it. Countering is a big part of if you cant learn to counter enemies then your not gonna have a great time. Some enemies require you to counter them if you want to realistically take them down and it can be daunting. I feel like I didn't get the hang of the mikari counter until I fought the final boss so yes it is hard but trust me if you have the patience its worth it. So other then the combat what else did I like about the game well the setting of feudal Japan was a nice change of pace for FromSoft games and overall the game look's really good. The story is actually not that hard to follow unlike many of their other games. That's not to say its not cripted because it still is in many ways but at the very least you will have an idea of what's going on at all times. And I really liked the story of Sekiro exploring new areas and learning more about Ashina was really interesting. And the highlight of the game would have to be the bosses with some very good bosses in this game. There's a lot of mini bosses to but id say most of them are alright but a few definitely throwaway encounters or just really annoying. My favorite bosses would have to be the guardian ape and the divine dragon one for its challenge and the other just because its fun to fight with out being super difficult. Overall Sekiro is really good if I had to criticize it I would say it's maybe a bit to hard in some spots and trying to get all the skills to get the trophy required some annoying grinding and I wish you could upgrade your defensive capabilities in some way other then just getting more HP. But those are small complaints that don't really take away from the overall experience.",9,2022-04-30,PLAYSTATION 4,user

PhillusMaximus,"So I bought this game the first time it came out and wasn't too happy with it. Was already hoping for elden ring at that time and sold it again after an initial playthrough. Rated it at around 6-7. I bought this game again a few weeks ago, put my already made opinions aside and completly let in on the experience. Mainly because I started replaying the souls games after elden rinf and because I saw so many beatiful fight montages, that I wanted to play it again very badly. Now after the second time playing it I got to admit, I did this game so wrong! The story is great (told a bit different than other from titles); gameplay is super flashy, fast and action filled; many new mechanics (some would later find their way in elden ring). What bothered me the most in my initial experience, were the limited customizations (gameplay and character wise) as well as the ridiculously high difficulty. HOWEVER, if you accept that this not dark souls and commit to learning the mechanics of this game, you'll quickly get a hang of it and realize, that the game isn't that hard if you don't try to dodge roll everything. The amount of skills in the game is huge and they look fantastic! Even if you are always a shinobi without option to ""switch your class"", it still changes the way you play immensely. I still think, that a few other katanas (even if it were only skins) or character skins (3 found their way into the game with a free dlc) wouldn't have hurt the game. But overall, this is an incredible game and I would love to see a sequel (or prequel?)",9,2022-04-29,PLAYSTATION 4,user

randomgamer1917,10/10 This game is amazing. best from soft game ever and I've played them all. Its a MUST PLAY. some of the hardest and most satisfying boss battles ever.

MiguelGam,"One of my favourite games of all time, fromsoft takes the dark souls formula and turns into a badass anime fight style that is extremely rewarding when getting used to, in my opinion this game has not only an Interesting story and amazing levels including some of the most epic boss fights I have ever experienced, it also has possibly one of the best combats in videogame history.",10,2022-02-25,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Anti-ReviewBomb,"Im a huge From fan but I have to admit putting this game down twice and almost writing it off forever. I can't explain why but on my third attempt everything seemed to click in a way it hadn't before and instead of another rage quit I got to enjoy another From Masterpiece. When youre fighting massive Bosses in the Souls series, at times it can feel very iffy when trying to roll your way out of eating a 20 foot long sword with a 100 foot long swath area. Not so with Sekiro. The game can definitely be Brutal at times but there was never a moment where I died and blamed it on the game. The combat is so clean and precise that it leaves no doubt that every failure is user error. It's clear what you did wrong and you know what you need to work on. Hang in there. And if you do quit, keep it lying around where you can see it. Let it taunt you until you give it another go. It's too good to give up on entirely.",10,2022-02-22,PLAYSTATION 4,user

eded9999,"I replay it on PS4 from PC. The same excellent game, with probably the best melee system of any action-adventure game. Challenging, fast and beautiful. Nice characters and good story. A LOT of mini-bosses. Not that full of options like previous FromSoftware games (weapons, outfits, builds, etc) but still and amazing game. Final boss it's super hard but awesome to master. Only caveat on PS4 is the bad framerate, specially on Ashina Castle.",9,2022-02-20,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Dyldom,"Probably my most controversial gaming take of all time is that I think this game is really really poor. I‚Äôm a huge fan of fromsoft games, in fact I‚Äôve played every soulsborne game to completion at least once other than DS2. I really believe this game doesn't deserve to be in the same conversation as Dark souls and especially bloodborne. A lot of elements of this game feels like a step back from its predecessors including those that came out over a decade ago. For example cutscenes that lead into boss fights play every SINGLE time you approach the boss. Not only does this not make narrative sense in the context of the game, but its needlessly frustrating. Fromsoft seemingly recognised this when creating Demon Souls in 2009 and this issue is resolved in that game, so why not here? Other than it‚Äôs verticality, the world is, in my opinion, less interesting in both its design and art direction than the games that came before it bar a small number of locations. The grappling hook which should be an absolute game changer picks and chooses when to work properly, and the option for meaningful customisation in the build of your character is gone completely. The combat, while extremely satisfying and rewarding during 1on1s, falls apart completely when facing more than 1 enemy which might be fine if there isn't a non optional boss encounter based on fighting two bosses at once. This is not an interesting way of scaling difficulty, this is creating a situation that the combat mechanics are not built to handle well in order to make it difficult for the player to progress. I think this game falls short in almost every aspect of its direction, and I‚Äôm adamant it‚Äôs Game of the Year win is some inside industry joke that I‚Äôm not in on.",4,2022-02-19,PLAYSTATION 4,user
GameWorldGR,"It‚Äôs a game for the gamers! It demands loyalty and devotion. If you complete it, it will give you an enormous reward. If you can‚Äôt complete it, you shouldn‚Äôt even start it. Miyazaki brought us another perfection at the level designing, a superior lore and a delightful gameplay. But Miyazaki‚Äôs achievement isn‚Äôt that he gave as a masterpiece. His achievement is that it‚Äôs the 5th masterpiece we play because of him. We can‚Äôt wait for the 6th (Elden Ring).",10,2022-02-17,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Mohamed_Bahr,"This game pushed the boundries of gameplay mechanics to a new high with this parry focused fight system. I moved from almost declaring it not doable first when trying it out, to then become so good at it and enjoy my montage worthy captured replays. This is a new genre of fight system in my opinion mainly because the game almost doesn‚Äôt approve of enemy health depletion by continuous striking. It can only be done through stagger meter depletion by continuous well timed parries. The lack of resources in the game and farming ability is clear but it greatly pours over to the need of getting better at the game rather than rely on charms and enhancement items. It also creatively pours over to the game‚Äôs replayability. Speaking of which, the replayability on this game is also great. I‚Äôm currently on my second play through, and I already see my self going for a third one. I‚Äôm just having so much fun going back to the before hard enemies with my newly gained expertise and beating them with style. I also love the idea of over powering some of them. To me gaming is all about empowering the player. I find Sekiro to be at the top of this standard. Sekiro is a gaming phenomenon to me. Gameplay innovation at its best and it needs to be appreciated by all gamers.",9,2022-02-16,PLAYSTATION 4,user

tuanchuong789,"Although I still think either Dark Souls 3 or Bloodborne is the best FROMSOFTWARE game so far, Sekiro is still an awesome, solid game and in my opinion, the game has the most satisfying combat system as they got rid of stamina and wanted players to go all out, but the game is still a challenging experience. To me, the game was super hard at first and could have been the most difficult out of all FROMSOFTWARE games, but the more familiar I got with the combat system, the less challenging the game became. Overall, it's a great game",9,2022-02-09,PLAYSTATION 4,user
MetalRobot69,"As a Souls series veteran, I was really surprised how good is the gameplay of this game. It is a lot faster than DS and has a three different types of dodges and those things make de combat system a lot more fun. The ambientation is incredible with gorgeous scenarios (Fountainhead Palace) and the variety of enemies and especially bosses is incredible there are bossies of different types and shapes, and all are very cool to face. The story when I played I really liked but after that, I forgot. It has some good plot twists but is a forgettable story because you don't have the same attachment to the characters as the games with really good stories that work on the characters that build up your attachment over time, like Atreus and Kratos relationship on God of War or the relationship among Arthur and his gang on RDR2. Here in Sekiro, I don't know exactly the protagonist and his Master (Kuro) and the game doesn't build up either, so the plot twists are cool, the story is cool but is forgettable because you don't really like the characters.",9,2022-01-31,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Little_Unicorn,"This is the most disgusting game From Software, Hidetaka Miyazaki and his team are probably witches who feed on hatred, anger and despair of people, I can't imagine any other reason to make this piece of **** The game is made for hundreds of perverts who pass DS and BB without leveling and with a broken sword in their hands, but it does not give me any pleasure to learn to play in this manner for 50 hours, do not buy this garbage made by sadists for perverts spending thousands of hours playing their games, if the PSN policy would be like Steam, I would definitely return the money. Spare your time and money.",0,2022-01-29,PLAYSTATION 4,user
LeMerluche,"One of the best from software games with bloodborne. Sekiro is a little much difficult of other from software game bacause you only can farm your skill, not your stats. They cr√™ate a new mechanic with block. The world is really well designed and the possibility to use grappe fit really well with the world and the sensation of liberty. Its a must have",10,2022-01-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Brotelho,"Sekiro feels like a modern Bushido Blade game with adventure mode. It's unfortunate that those who pre-ordered this game thinking it was like Samurai Souls were disappointed. Sekiro is a fantastic adventure sword fighting game. It doesn't try to dazzle you with easy to perform combos. It doesn't throw heaps of enemies at you to make you feel like a god. Sekiro is a sword fighting game that requires discipline and intentional inputs. Those who think this is just a button mashing fighting game clearly never took the time to learn the mechanics of the game. Sekiro focuses on raw sword fighting. Once you learn the true mechanics of the combat system (once it all starts to ""click"") it truly is something unlike most games out there. Combos are not just handed to you on a plate. You are in control of your own combos. You make those combos on-the-fly while you clash swords with your enemies. Sekiro gives you a utility belt of tools and it's up to you on how you use them. Sekiro ages like fine wine as you continue to play and get better at the mechanics. Long time Souls fans may have forgotten what that feels like. They've forgotten the uphill battle of learning a Souls game. Sekiro is no different. For those will to learn Sekiro's mechanics will be rewarded with a unique combat system that feels incredible, lore that's just deep enough to be thought provoking, and a sense of confidence that's hard to replicate anywhere else. No game is without its faults and Sekiro is no different. Would be great to have a 1-on-1 PvP mode to challenge friends, but without PvP it is still a stellar game for those willing to learn and put in the work.",9,2022-01-13,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Jason0507,This games starts off well with its introductory sequence. However the story ends there and becomes an endless sequence of boss fights. Once you defeat one boss you have to navigate through one small section just to fight another. This formula repeats itself through out the whole game. With little to no story and just rinse and repeat gamplay this game is almost **** game looks amazing but it is just like putting lipstick on a pig. This game tries to mask its flaws with its difficulty. It's very challenging until you determine the attacks of the bosses then it's just a matter of time before you defeat them. It's a poor excuse for a game.,2,2022-01-11,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Blahblahuser,"I usually never rate games a 10 but this game deserves it. I was literally spellbound throughout my journey and I didn‚Äôt want it to end. I have only felt like this for a few games like BotW. Initially yes it did **** before I got the whole parry mechanic, but once it clicked nothing gave me much trouble as in the beginning. The locales and bosses are amazing I am a huge sword fight fan, and this game let me live my fantasy of sword fight to the death. The music works ok for the game even though it‚Äôs not my favorite type of music. There are no builds and no traditional leveling. Skills don‚Äôt do much as such the game is very balanced. It‚Äôs you, your sword and skills. The game honestly doesn‚Äôt require super ridiculous quick reflexes like most claim, but it does require observation. Noticing enemy animation and knowing that one thing the enemy does comes before something else. The only bad negative that I can give is that the camera doesn‚Äôt play nice particularly when you are in an arena that has obstructions like poles and doors. Often times you will end up in one of these places and the camera goes berserk and you trying to find the boss, because anytime you cannot view the boss your lock on targeting turns off. Sometimes I ended up between a door and the boss with no way to see what the hell was going on and difficulty in escaping this situation. Thankfully this doesn‚Äôt happen too often, but it is rather irritating. You will die a lot in your journey but this journey will be worth it.",10,2022-01-05,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Sensou,"Best game ever, definitely my number 1 game of all time. Tried Dark Souls and Bloodborne but just can't feel the excitement that all people have but Sekiro is different. The major factor might be the stamina bar which not exist in Sekiro so no more stamina management which affects the pacing of the gameplay, not a grinding game so I need to completely learn all the enemy pattern and experiment with all the prosthetic tools. The last is a satisfying parry mechanic which is the charm of this game. Story are also wonderful which you unlock and explore about it by yourself instead of the game leads you to the storyline. So, your decision and action will one way or another affect the story. Gameplay is no doubt the best game I've ever played as I've defeated this game 6 times now. Repetition is quite high to get all the story endings and of course to show how much you've improved throughout your gameplay. In conclusion, Sekiro completely change my mind of gaming nowadays in every aspects. Thank you FromSoft for the incredible journey you've created within this game. I know they are making another masterpiece right now which is Elden Ring but I do hope they didn't stop here with Sekiro type of game as I completely loving it. The Greatest and Coolest game I've ever played.",10,2021-12-16,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Raios-Rogue,the hardest best Fromsoftware game ever created with the best narrative story plot awesome endings phenomenal character development awesome NPC the mind of Miyazaki is so creative full with so much fantasy innovation i loved every second of this game this game will make you a much better gamer and hone your skills that transfer into other games as long as you have patience and i am still playing it to this day this game is the hardest game ever made its not for everyone if for those games that are hardcore gamers that want to become god tier gamers its a game that pushes your brain capacity to the limit and the gamers that have the patience to beat this game to give back Kur's charm and play with demon bell and no kuro charm to master this game like me have my most utmost respect i even respect people that are not as good gamers but are stubborn and put effort into beating finishing this game even if they dont want to comeback and play more thats on them they will miss the other endings and secret boss fights. Sekiro is very punishing yer rewarding and requires you to get good at deflecting think of deflecting as rhythm getting your timing correct the combat is very good you have plenty of arts shinobi arts and your shinobi prosthetic arm to work with the combat is fast paced faster than bloodborne be aggresive on your attacks and you will need to have great reflexes being patient having good cordination and great timing dodging properly will get you a long way because later if you decide to futher punish yourself to master the game and improve your skills like me go without Kuro charm and + demon bell that means if you dont deflect perfectly you take damage bosses have so much more damage posture and health as do enemies and they break your posture very fast you gotta master deflecting and doding and using your prosthetic arm and shinobi tools and shinobi arts at the same time sometimes just perfect deflecting wont do you any good in NG + 2 you are already getting killed in one hit and bosses break your posture very fast as long as you dont give up and you have patience to continue dying and playing you will get better at the game you will build muscle memory faster reflexes your senses will sharpen it's a punishing game made for the soulsborne fans its made for the hardcore and god tier gamers which are at the top of skill in gaming this game is mength to test fully what you got it will push you to the limit you will either get better and push past your limit evolving your skills and enjoying how much better your getting and how much better you playing and you will enjoy the entire game or you will become the one thing in gaming disrespect the most a casul gamer that never wants to get stronger and improve and play games on easy or normal difficulty and when he clashes with a game like this he becomes a quiter a btch ass niga that will give up miss out on a phenomenal game and quit and run to play fortnite like a coward staying the same weakling casual scrub they always have **** biggest disappointed is where is our Expansion The Lighting of tomoe i mean thank you Miyazaki for the DLC you gave us with the boss rush and new skills but all of us fromsoftware fans would have loved The lighting of tomoe Expansion i really hope this game gets a sequel because Wuchant Fallen Feathers from The Chinese are already stealing from Sekiro and Bloodborne i would Prefer Sekiro Sequel From Fromsoftware and Miyazaki which are talented Japanese developers rather than having to play A female Sekiro Wuchag The Fallen feathers where they are absolutely stealing all if your sounds and animations UI From Sekiro and Bloodborne.This is a must play game for gamers that seek to attain greater skills by striving to improve to enjoy a great narrative story and a fantastic semi open world filled with so much innovation fantasy and a fatanstic combat system dont give up become stronger acquire strength think of death not as annoyance but as a new begining for you to keep trying and keep getting better.

winzentween,Amazing. Game of the year. Balls to the wall hard. Best souls like. Not for everyone are all accurate disruptions of this brilliant masterpiece. I found it a little short and too hard at times and the optional end area was a little sparse otherwise it be a 10. It looks like dark souls but it is entirely different and you'll have to learn a unique play style and master it to win in this extremely difficult game. But when you master it you'll be rewarded. Also you can cheat in most of the areas where you might become stuck. The story is messy and more about the environmental story telling. But there are multiple endings and hidden areas. The graphics are excellent for ps5 pro though the frame rate really suffers and it would be worth playing on ps5 or pc. The sound and music is perfect. The gameplay is fantastic and the game lasts about 30 to 50 hrs. Though I finished it fully in less time. It's a shorter game than prior souls like. There is no end game content of note though you can replay it. This game is one of the best ever made but you must stick with it. This is not like nioh or ds3 or got. It is it's own thing and relentless. A must have purchase.,9,2021-11-09,PLAYSTATION 4,user

It's joy to play can often be hindered by this controversial 'difficulty' that is exhausting by design and has turned lots of fans away.

The minibosses are awful more than half the time, they're not near as polished as other enemies and some are rehashes of old bosses. I also personally dislike the inability to change appearance, the previous souls games always had amazing customization that this game lacks.

Lotex,"Pro: - Great story - Great characters - Good pace unless you go the wrong way too early - Good balance between stealth and combat - Great mix of bosses - Replay and Gaunlet option - Great boss variety, although some of them are somewhat recycled Cons: - EXTREMELY steep learning curve - Some enemies just deal obscene amounts of damage and take too much of a beating for being just regular guys - Tracking that is sometimes borderline infuriating (Chained Ogre for example) Overall I REALLY wanted to love the game from the beginning and in a way I did, I just couldn't get into the combat, so I played it a bit until I had to fight Genichiro and then dropped it, picked it up again a year later and dropped it again. This year I finally stayed on top of things, got gud and collected the last platinum for a From Soft game. Due to the missing co-op I'd say it is a great game for people that are either resistant to to frustration, that are good a both Soulsborne and rhythm games as the combat is kind of like a dance or that have a natural talent for anything new as Sekiro WILL force you to adept to this playstyle, unlike Dark Souls you can't hide behind a shield or get away with dodge all the time, you pretty much HAVE to parry/counter/deflect things. One thing I really didn't like all that much was the fact that you often had to seperate adds from their mini bosses which basically means you sneak up to them, kill the add, run away and wait for the boss to reset which is viable, but annoying when you die to them and you will over the span of the game. Some of these mini bosses have like 4 or more adds which gets old really quickly if you die to them.",8,2021-09-16,PLAYSTATION 4,user

spotlessmind55,"I can never understand that this is the game of the year. First of all, it's annoyingly difficult because lack of instructions and practical tutorials. And even if you'd found a way to beat a enemy, it would've never varied. It must be fun when you can find ways to improve your skills or strategies with some hints even if the difficulty is super high. Second of all, the voice of characters are awful. It's like the ones of Nintendo 64 or PS1. Non- native persons might not be bothered but for me as Japanese, it's hideous. And also the design and move of characters are not entirely fashionable or smooth. Again it's like the ones of PS2 or Wii. After all, personally, it felt old-fashioned. Not an antique.",6,2021-09-07,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Sensou12,"Well well well, the best PS4 game in my opinion. Bought it on June and took me one month to reach Isshin and beat him. Believe me, I hate the game as I keep saying that I will put the game down and forget about it as the difficulty is insanely hard. But decided to spend at least 1 hour with the game per day and all of sudden, for the last 2 week before I finish the game, I put down all my ps4 game and completely just playing Sekiro for 14 days straight. The reason for that is you are not levelling up your character but the game is levelling you up with each boss encounter which feel amazing. Sounds ridiculous but as I keep moving forward, it's just getting better and better. All the parry mechanic like normal parry, mikiri counter, etc is just a small example how the game successfully make you feel badass when you manage to execute it perfectly. Lack of customization? No big deal, I've never been a big fan of dark souls and bloodborne because of that as with Sekiro, the point is you just need to getting better learn every enemy attack pattern, sharpen your reflect and observation skills and I believe even you die a lot, you just keep coming back and said ""Ok, i got it! I'll beat this monster this time"" I'm on my 2nd play-through now and you'll just realize the fact that I just mentioned ""The game is levelling you up"" as I've reached and beaten Owl Ashina in only 3 hours of playing the game which it took me around 20 hours to reach him on my 1st play through and it's still took me around 20-30 tries but now it just took me 2 tries to beat him. CONCLUSION: Worth to try if you start to feel all games nowadays just focus on looking graphically stunning and make you feel overpower. This game is completely different and you'll not regret it (you might at the first few hours but just keep pushing and you'll know it) TIPS: Don't be afraid of dying, dying is part of the game as you might die to learn all the enemy tricks and attack pattern. It's common thing so don't dodge or running away, instead just keep on playing defense and learn all the attack patterns. 2. Don't hesitate when you feel you can attack but don't rush or greedy, keep looking at the enemy attack motion as they tend to look slow but it's a complete trap",10,2021-08-16,PLAYSTATION 4,user

You have to be aware that this is a niche game, in the same way that simulators are designed to be realistic, this game is specifically designed to be difficult. It requires a lot of patience, resilience and skill. So my advise is that unless you are a person who enjoy challenges you should not buy this game. If you really want to play the game you can just use an easy mod, it would be a weird experience because the game was not designed to be like that, but you can still enjoy the game and the rich lore, and who knows, maybe after that you can play the game for real.",10,2021-08-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user

In the end, it is a great game it is game of the year of 2019. If you are a fan of soul games and didn‚Äôt play this game, then you are missing a lot.

Smallchungus167,"Sekiro adds the posture system and making the constant attacking and pinpoint deflecting a must in every encounter - steel clashes on steel in a rhythmic, mesmerizing, and almost hypnotic manner. Another crucial element that makes this game such an enthralling experience to play is the inclusion of perilous attacks. When the enemy flashes a red kanji symbol, you have a second to determine what they're doing and how you're supposed to react accordingly: will they thrust you? Step on their weapon the moment it launches. Will they perform a sweep? Jump over the sweep and counter them with an overhead attack. Will they attempt to grab you? Dodge towards their back to give yourself a big opening. This system feels daunting at first, but I guarantee it will click with you at some point in the game, and it will feel fantastic to counter perilous attacks, something no other video game has ever done yet.",10,2021-08-07,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Skouyter21,"This is one of the best games I've played in a while. Yes it's difficult to play but the feeling of reward I got from beating bosses who I've been battling for hours(sometimes days) is so satisfying. You have to literally go into this game with the mindset of a professional boxer. There is going to be a lot of rounds to fight(expect to die a LOT)and you'll need to get good at studying your opponents, looking for weaknesses, and exploiting those weaknesses in a careful and timely manner. This game is chess not checkers. You also have to be a glutton for punishment in playing this as well. This isn't one of those games that will ask you if you want to decrease the difficulty because you keep getting manhandled by a boss or mini boss. You died? Too bad. Go back and try again. This game is THAT much of a savage. Those who gave this a 1 star review either thought it would be like something else entirely or just aren't built to tackle a truly challenging game experience.

Knindish46,Amazing game one of my favorites. Combat it beautiful and simple yet never gets tired. Prosthetics are an amazing tool and it seems like every enemy and boss has a specific counter. There are multiple skill trees and each ability you get changes your character a significant amount. Each skill changes the way you play or approach a fight. The environments in the world are amazing and really immerse you in the fantasy world. The enemy variety is very diverse and there are tons of unique enemies and the same applies to bosses. The game is very hard and there is no way to change it.

The atmosphere, sounds, music instills such a sense of connection with the protagonist that he is easily my favourite character. And the sense of reward and achievement is unparalled.

Een goed bereik aan vijanden houdt het fris.Prachtig ontworpen omgeving, nogmaals, geen ander spel komt in de buurt, vanaf het begin de toren met uitzicht op de maan en het hoge gras, gewoon prachtig.Uitstekende waarde om het spel meerdere keren opnieuw te spelen, omdat het steeds moeilijker wordt in een nieuw spel. Veel geheimen te vinden.Uitstekende sfeer. Geweldige voice-acting. Leuk om te spelen. Briljant spel.",10,2021-08-05,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Afternoonwood5,"Very good game. in a lot of ways better than the dark souls series. It is very fast paced, combat relies on black and countering and this is done very quickly and needs to be precise. The ability to jump, and grapple around is a lot of fun. It a lot of ways this game is a mixture of assassins creed, and the dark souls games.",10,2021-08-05,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Makejames188,"This game has Tenchu lineage in it's blood and that's a good thing. The combat, while a very challenging and fluid affair is not the only means to take out the enemies presented to you in this huge yet dense action adventure/stealth game. THIS IS NOT DARK SOULS. Just because you have played that series or Bloodborne doesn't not mean the same mechanics and principles apply. This is a stealth action game where running away and finding ambush and vantage point to whittle down the enemies numbers rewards you more than swinging your sword till things die. This game rewards patience alot more than brazen fighting ability. As a lover of the stealth genre it's painful tio watch players stand on the top of a building with a huge vantage point that allows you to scope out the area and plan you attack just jump into the middle of four to five enemies yelling that the game is too hard. There's more than one way to play this game. I'd definitely recommend it to stealth action players and fans , not to casual Souls fans.",10,2021-08-05,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Peterthefile692,"The first time was so hard I used a guide to cheese the game. Second time I actually played the game after having some experience, it's challenging: until you get the hang of the bosses moves and counter often. 3rd play through is easy: you'll have mastered countering and see how repetitive the bosses are. 4th play through was a spreed run for me. 5th run I got bored of being OP. Doesn't play like dark souls but is definitely worth buying on sale: I'd say it's just as hard as DS for first time players.",10,2021-08-05,PLAYSTATION 4,user
oonabe,"This is the worst ninja/samurai game I've ever played, and yes, I know Sekiro is a shinobi but I put it on that more general genre so I can compare to a wider range of games that have similar settings and contents as this. Sekiro is a game that many people seem to think is hard and many players are proud to beat and speak about it with a big mouth, if there is a term likes souls veteran it's exactly because of that, they think souls games are hard and if they come back alive from that experience it's comparable to a war veteran or something. Well, let me tell you something, these games are not hard at all, their difficulty is mostly faked and the way to beat them often very very simplistic, which is why the games get so popular at the end, because there isn't really much to them, it doesn't really need skills or intelligence to beat any FromSoftware game, it only needs a little bit of patience to find out how they work and when you find out they're a piece of cake. With Sekiro this formula has been taken to the max, the game is not hard at all, it's only inflexible, it only lets you beat it by using a very limited range of moves, but if you have a little patience and learn those (I'm talking about basically four moves, it isn't that much) you can beat the game easily and you can see what a piece of crap and lazy work this game actually is. The game lives from a couple of ohs and ahs moments like some big snake boss or a moneky that keeps fighting after being beheaded and of course also of horde of vehement fans of this company who would buy anything as long as they see the FromSoftware logo on it, if you don't believe go see what they are doing with upcoming Elden Ring, all of them wetting their pants everytime someone sneezes and it sounds similar to the words elden ring, it's just like Justin Bieber hysterical fans at this point. The thing is that this game is so simple that it becomes boring after a couple of boss fights because anyone with a brain can see that no matter the boss design, if it's a samurai on a horse or an old lady or big snake... at the end you always do the same three moves and every fight feels the same. The story is crap, I've seen a lot of FS fans criticizing the story of other games when they're no different from Sekiro's then they don't do the same with this one or even say Sekiro's story is good. Also the NPC's AI is one of the dumbest I've seen since the 90s, just try throwing a shuriken to some enemy who's aware of you, you will see one single animation that you could looping forever if you had endless shuriken - lazy work, as I said. The difficulty is completely faked, most of it is hidden behind a terible input lag (if you compare this game's speed and responsiveness to most japanese games it feels like a bad joke, like someone telling you you have to run very fast and at the same time puts heavy weights on your shoes) and also the long animations. From the moment you push the button to hit with your sword to the moment your sword actually hits there is often a long animation that gives the NPC enough time for an input read and react to what you have pushed without being noticed, unless you have a brain of course, then you only need to use your logic to find out this game is no hard, it's only cheating you in a very cheap way. And the proof of it is the existence of an ""invisible help"" in the game, which as the name says it's not visible, there is nothing like a ghost helping you in battle, it is only that they give you a little bit more of random values in your favor when tricking you in such a blatant way. This game is pure crap and many people might say then why was it game oif the year 2019? Well, did you remember Activision put some money on it? Again, use your logic and don't be fooled by gaming companies like these. Sekiro is the worst game in this genre and anyone with a little bit of intelligence and analytical thinking can see it, don't let vehement fanboys tell you what you have to like or dislike, even when that seems to be the trend in the internet era. Don't even listen at me with this critic play the game but be critical to what you see and be honest to yourself when talking about it, that's what I'm doing here if you like what you hear or not.

Well, you are pretty much glued face to face with your opponent for 80% of the time. Sekiro is a fighting game (with some light stealth segments). There are two genres of games I don't like and never have: sport games and fighting games. Also, there is zero weapon variety which makes the combat even more lackluster. What a pity.

Tenarus,"I am just dissappointed by the game FromSoft delivered here. The voiceacting and graphics are good. But thats really it. The game is full of severe (!) bugs, the movement is very inprecise, buggy and laggy - you can clearly note, that FromSoft used the same engine Ds3 ran on and this engine isn't really suited for Sekiro. I would go that far to state: The movement is in points of bugs, missing physics and in general its ""wonkyness"" the worst I have seen in any game up to this date (and this includes Skyrim!). The balancing is ok (you expect hard enemies from a soulslike game). Most of the enemies are repeats along the way. Enemy-design does not get interesting in the slightest. The bosses are bland as well and not challenging at all. ""Challenge"" only comes from the quantity of enemies, never from quality. Putting enemies right next to savepoints is just a bad decision design-wise; developers should know better and not make this mistake. I pushed myself to do the platinum, hoping the game would get fun at some point. In the end this time was wasted. Sekiro wasnt fun in the beginning and it still wasnt when I was done with the platinum trophy. 2 points for voiceacting and graphics, 1 for new ideas (the arm with integrated hook, ...). But sadly 0 points for controlls, enemy-design and gameplay in general. Edit: I've given the game another shot once again and need to revise my scoring. If the only challenge within a game comes from its badly made controls, I cant give any points for ideas and graphics. Challenge compared to other souls-likes 1/10, execution of controlls 0/10. Overall funfactor of the game 0/10 as well.",0,2021-07-06,PLAYSTATION 4,user

They are completely different but share a lot of similarities. Is sekiro really much more difficult than Dark souls? Yes. How? Sekiro is completely a single-player experience. You will not receive any help from the community. Now, if you found a roadblock in Sekiro, this is the kind of game that requires you to use some of your braincells in order to be adaptive and learn from the mistakes of your defeat. The combat is far more superior than Darksouls, the world and aesthetics of Sekiro trumps Darksouls. However, the exploration aspect of Darksouls is far more satisfying.

Jahuui6148,"Having played all dark souls games as well as Bloodborne I thought I was well prepared for Sekiro. I soon realized i was not. A lot of the mechanics seem similar yet so different. The combat system is stunning. As I never used shields in any souls game, always just grabbing the biggest weapon I could get my hands on I had a hard time getting used to deflecting. Majority of combat is deflecting attacks and boy it is satisfying to get a streak of perfect deflects. Most boss fights are so incredible that I did not mind at all getting my ass smacked over and over. Especially Owl (father), I died to him at least a dozen times yet I enjoyed every single fight. Most bosses have unique movesets and are very challenging yet beatable. Story is very engaging and despite wanting to go for the Shura ending I chose the Purification mostly because of the want to be the ""good guy"". Character dialogues hide a lot of secrets and similarly as in other FromSoft games most of the story is hidden. Most characters, including mini-bosses, have an interesting backstory worth exploring through eavesdrops, item collection and easter eggs. Death is arguably more punishing than in souls. Upon death Sekiro loses half his Sen (money) and a lot of experience. Neither is anyhow possible to regain other than gaining new. The skill system is very intricate however I found only a select few of the skills to be useful. On the other hand the prosthetic tool upgrades were one of my favourite features, however difficult it is to fully upgrade all of the **** best part about Sekiro are the bosses. Never being a fan of big bosses I was very sceptical of the Guardian Ape. I was pleasantly surprised how well done the boss is and I enjoyed it as much as all the swordfights, which are absolutely spectacular.

I will list my pros and cons and then make a small comentary about it: Pros: + Game is very polished, and i did not feel like i was getting BS killed as it happened sometimes with the Dark Souls games. + Combat is more dynamic than any of the Dark Souls, and also more than bloodborne. + It has a story you can follow without reading 400 item descriptions. + ""Bonfires"" at bosses door makes it far more entertaining, as it allows you to fight them full HP and items, so you can play more agro, and it's also a LOT less infuriating when you die. + Graphics are really beautiful. I wish i had a monitor over 1080p to play this. + Defeating some bosses for the first time feels like a real achievement, not crappy ""ez mechanics"" like Storm Ruler on DS3. + Customizable controls! +Had way less "" it im leaving it here"" with this game than with any other fromsoftware title. Cons: - Once you get the parry system, it's more of a walk than anything else to be honest.Combining NG+ and NG++ i only died to bosses 3 times, doing the two longest endings, and one of them was because i ran out of battery on my controller. - It only took me 42 hours to unlock every single achievement and complete 4 runs (from ng to ng+++). - Although you have a lot of prosthetic tools and upgrades, and habilities at your disposal, if you learn to parry almost every single one of them is rendered useless.",10,2021-06-30,PLAYSTATION 4,user

5Naelok,"Playing Sekiro is this bizarre dance between feeling utterly helpless and completely invulnerable. You first encounter a boss and the mops the floor with you. You struggle to stay ahead of his attacks, guzzling potions and cursing as you barely manage to shave off even 25% of a health bar in there before dying. You get smashed down and murdered by the **** again and again. Then it clicks, and you've got it. You know to jump right after the fury attack, back up and then counter when he raises his blade over his left shoulder and that he's wide open if you get behind him after the sword combo. All of a sudden you're blowing through the boss' first form (or maybe two) without taking a hit. I like that feeling. It's damn hard, but I'm not getting better at fights because I leveled up my sword power, I am getting better because I have mastered these immensely complicated patterns and am weaving between them to attain victory. For it is in that gap between helplessness and invulnerability where true beauty is to be found.",10,2021-06-27,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Uglzorp579,"Sekiro is what happens when you mix Tenchu with Dark Souls. You can sneak and backstab your way through most of the game but when it comes to bosses, you'll have to fight. As someone who was frustrated by certain elements of Dark Souls, I found Sekiro to be far more enjoyable. The biggest improvement is the shrine system (equivalent to the bonfires in DS). Unlike the bonfires in DS, shrines are always placed next to bosses. This greatly reduces the amount of backtracking you have to do whenever you get killed (which will happen a lot). In addition, using a shrine doesn't automatically respawn enemies unless you rest or fast travel. Finally, shrines are far more plentiful than bonfires were in DS. Throw in your grappling hook and rapid move speed and you'll never take long to get where you want to go. The bonfire system in DS always felt like it was designed to waste my time and the shrine system in Sekiro is a huge improvement.",10,2021-06-27,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Britannia11,"This game taught me the very hard way to fight masterly with the katana. Like in real life the katana here is more than just a sword; is has a soul of its own. You have to be one with it, if you want to master this game. In contrast to any Souls or Souls-like game the victory over an oppenent isn't the most rewarding, in Sekiro it is sword combat itself which has one of the best fighting systems I have ever known in a game so far. Thus, the combats against every minor or big boss are an extraordinary immersive and intensive experience. Like in a real sword duel everything ‚Äì or in other words your victory or death - depends on whether you can ‚Äûread‚Äú the movements of your opponents or not; furthermore, if you can handle your katana the perfectly right way, especially to block and parry all of your opponent's attacks in the very right moment. And if you do so, you can decide the duel in your favour in a very brief moment, so that you kill your enemy and will be victorious ‚Ä¶ or you will be dead also in just a few seconds ;). Overall a great game from From Software, which has some similarities to their previous games (Dark Souls 1-3, Bloodborne), but in its way and style it is very unique and outstanding, especially because of its exceptional duels, which will make you tensed up and sweat like in no other game before. Yes, it is quite difficult, but everyone can handle it, who has the patience and passion to try a difficult and severe situation or boss fight over and over again - even if there will be only little progress at times - and is willing to learn from his/her own mistakes.",10,2021-06-27,PLAYSTATION 4,user
TitanOfRage5,"When I heard that Sekiro wasn't going to have character customization, weapon pick ups, armor pickups, and many other features that were in other Dark Souls games. I thought the game was going to be absolutely terrible. after playing it every day for the past few days I can honestly say that I enjoy the game. ya its lacking in those features but what it lacks, it makes up for in story, combat features, and a depth of free movement that makes you feel like a stealthy badass. The game is absolutely breathtaking in its visuals and it amps up what made the Dark Souls franchise so infamous, it takes Dark Souls difficulty pisses on it and ramps it up a notch. You trembled at sister friede well wait for what the Butterfly lady has in store for you! Dark Souls always gave you a difficult first boss to rumble with before you entered the world of bend over and take it.

PA1ker56,Such a great game and so satisfying. Unlearn the dodge/roll technique from Dark Souls/Bloodborne cause it won't help you here as this game requires mainly patience and a lot of deflecting skills. Combat is fluid and bosses are difficult but not impossible. Keep at it and it does get easier as you learn the enemy's moves and learn to utilize your tools properly. Exploration is fun and there are many ways to play the game as you aren't forced into one linear path so you can go off and do side bosses before the main bosses if you wish.

It's like it took all the best parts from all from games and put it into one. no dumb gimmicks like pvp, co-op, or whack rpg elements. it's a pure videogame. anyone that says sekiro is too hard and needs an easy mode is a little **** that should kill themself.

Dr_Unk,"This was the first game from ""From Software"" that I played and HOLY **** that was hard! I would play the game, get frustrated because of the difficulty, and quit. Then every time I turned on my PS4, I felt as if the game was taunting me. So, I ended getting ""GUD"" and was able to beat the game. Despite the difficulty, This is still a great game! Very creative gameplay as well as some very creative boss fights that keep you on your toes. A couple of things I didn't care for was the plot being very dialogue-heavy and the dragonrot. Every time you talked to one of the main NPC's, I felt like it would go on forever, and it got boring real quick. And as for the dragonrot portion, I understand why it's there but I think it could have been done better.

A few topics to consider: ‚Ä¢ The combat is extremelly satisfying and fair; ‚Ä¢ No bs monster placing (sup DS2); ‚Ä¢ No janky hitboxes; ‚Ä¢ There are no weapons or armor in the game (but there's still equipment to be found and crafted); ‚Ä¢ The bosses are an absolute blast to fight; ‚Ä¢ The story is not as convoluted as in the DS series, and I loved it.

Ironwy4,"This game is something else... You feel every strike of your blade and it's so satisfying if you manage to parry several fast attacks in a row. I played a lot of games and I can easily say that this game offers the best combat/fight system to date. It's extremely rewarding and makes you feel like a total badass. Your prosthetic arm gives you a a lot of addition tactics in battle due to the collection of gadgets you can attach to it. Also you can learn unique combos, strikes and skills. So yeah like I said pretty awesome gamplay wise. The story is nothing too spectacular but keeps you motivated. Every region has some sort of verticality for your movement with the grappling hook. Stealth makes many parts a lot easier. I think Dark Souls 1 and Bloodborne have still better regions and atmosphere but thats my opinion. I'd say this game is not as hard as Dark Souls 1 or Bloodborne due to the fact it's way fairer and stealth makes -like I said- almost every part easier except for the bosses ofc .. In addition you almost never die because of some BS. Ye it has a steep learning curve but it's very rewarding. After Bloodborne my favorite Soulsborne like game. Go buy it, you won't regret it.",10,2021-06-22,PLAYSTATION 4,user
KxngMikk1888,"Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, A 16th century supernatural ARPG from the legendary studio FromSoftware and mastermind Hidetaka Miyazaki, the man that gave us the phenomenal Bloodborne and Dark Souls franchise. Sekiro is based in a fictional version of 16 Century Japan where you play a Shinobi called Sekiro meaning One-Armed Wolf. The game starts with an opening cinematic about the conflict in Ashina coming to an end, You see Sekiro as a child, as a man (Owl) walks up to him and asks the ""Starving Wolf"" to join him, He trains the child ""relentlessly"" to become a master Shinobi. You start the game of in a cell pit as someone throws down the clue to your escape, this first chapter is sort of a way to help you get a feel for the game and it's controls, if your used to the typical Dark Souls gameplay you're going to have to adjust your playstyle as Sekiro is all about posture, at the bottom of the screen your posture is displayed and at the top your enemies, you have to deflect to build up posture, blocking works but not as well, you have a very small time frame to deflect so your reflexes have to be on point as that could lead to death. In previous FromSoftware games dying was the worst thing that could happening, in Sekiro they took a different approach as you can resurrect once after each death, some enemies have this as well, above their health there is a red indicator so you know how many times they can resurrect.",10,2021-06-22,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Smallbund25,"The combat is the most rewarding system I have come across to date and it just keeps pulling you in for more. Feeling and hearing those perfectly timed parries and seeing the enemy posture meter fill up is incredibly satisfying, and it's something few games manage to pull off. The deathblows look great and all the animations feel fluent and spot on. Scenery is astonishing. I loved every single area in the game and everything from ambience and music to environmental storytelling was perfect. Please play this game, for your own sake.",10,2021-06-22,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Sentienl1720,"+ It has the open ended level design of Dark Souls 1, with you being able to take out bosses in the order you want via map branching at a certain point. + The combat is very good. It's the first combat system I've seen that manages to pull off fast swordfighting convincingly while not being a clunky mess or guess work. Some moves are very satisfying to pull off, like Lightning Reversal or Mid-air Deathblows, and the sound effects of deflecting just makes it all more satisfying. + The story has the most branching of any FromSoft game yet (which isn't a lot, admittedly), with some bosses being exclusive to certain choices, and one of them is the first time FromSoft has done something of the sort. + Resource scarcity is done very well, making the consumables you pick up through exploration and mini-boss killing extremely valuable. + All the encounters are designed to encourage players to use consumables instead of just hoarding them. + The big majority of the tools are good or great. + There isn't a single area that makes me think ""I don't wanna go through this annoying again"", unlike all the past FromSoft games. + Final boss forces you to use everything you've learned throughout the game while not feeling unfair. + Trademark Miyazaki-led enemy placement and usage. Unlike Dark Souls 2 and Dark Souls 3's DLC, which had Tanimura's handiwork, this game doesn't bombard you with extremely annoying waves of enemies in closed spaces that you have to bruteforce your way through with no other options or trick to the encounters. - Emblem system is annoying. I honestly wish it'd just replenish when you rested/communed at an idol and didn't require buying them. There are some times where you're banging your head against a boss encounter but you run out of emblems and gold to buy them. The system as-is does not really encourage experimentation a lot. - Most of the soundtrack is trash - which doesn't surprise me considering Yuka Kitamura composed most of it. There are a couple songs that I liked and got me in the mood, but I noticed there was a 2nd composer, and I'm willing to bet they had his hand, just like Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3. - One particular optional boss fight is terrible and ignores 90% of the combat mechanics in the game, which leaves a very bad taste in your mouth. It's a Bloodborne boss in Sekiro. It just doesn't work. - Hitboxes on grabs are (still) totally, now a problem exacerbated by the reduced iframes. Both beast bosses use these fairly often, and if a death results from a bad hitbox it can be pretty triggering. Excellent game.",10,2021-06-22,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Deathbringer11,One of the best Stealth / Hack and Slash games to exist. Feels more like Onimusha than it does Demon Souls. Requires patience and rhythm style parrying in swordplay.

BalliSti0X,"Sekiro is a great game that is quiet challenging even if you have beaten the souls series multiple times. The combat is very fast paced and with ""posture"" being a major player with in the system it takes some getting used to coming from two handed great swords. Parrying is another major part of the combat system and you probably wont get very far without it. Each enemy give experience points that can be used to unlock skills. Unlocking skills does make things like sneaking around and using ""Sugars"" and other items to last longer but you can certainly get through the game without spending them. I didn't use the ""special move"" skills much as they took along time to come out and i didn't find the pay off to be worth the risk. You can scroll through your inventory during combat as time is paused which is different to Dark Souls. This makes it so that you can find the item you want and use it without having to run away, scroll through your hot bar and make enough distance so you can use the item all at the same time. All in all, I think Sekiro was fun to play and very satisfying to complete but I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. I would still recommend Sekiro but don't go in thinking it's like Dark Souls because you will be disappointed.",10,2021-06-21,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Them approaching a traditional japanese setting with their own fantasy/folklore elements really delivered a special game, and this time without a convoluted story, easy-to-miss sidequests or absurd game design. They delivered an unforgiving, brutal and fast-paced samurai action tale that also happens to have the best combat and bosses across their titles. Overall, I am extremely pleased with everything, from voice acting (japanese), music, gameplay, graphics, level design, story, game length. If anything, they should work on their lipsync and models, but in the grand scheme of things, I can see why this game earned the GOTY awards it did. A must-have for anyone looking for a challenging but fair experience.",10,2021-06-21,PLAYSTATION 4,user
MultiSapman37,"This game is difficult if you are used to playing Dark Souls-ish games as it makes you unlearn a lot of the mechanics from those games. Instead of block/rolling/continuous evasion, this game forces you to go head-on and clash the glorious nippon steel with your foes at full throttle. If you keep your block up, prepare to get punished after getting posture broken. The trick is to learn the enemies attack patterns and deflect his attacks by just blocking the instant his/her damage is about to hit you. All the other while, you need to be aggressive and target their posture meter down to get deathblows. If you consider enemies having just 2 resource bars (health and posture in sekiro instead of health and stamina from souls games), then focusing on posture breaks is what works in Sekiro. At the end of the day Sekiro's combat seems close to a rhythm game.",10,2021-06-21,PLAYSTATION 4,user

By the end of the game, the player is faced with an all too familiar challenge that makes the players growth in their first playthrough all the more apparent and rewarding.

jack441,"I am huge Souls fan, I had played all From games (including Elden ring) before starting Sekiro. Many people told me that it is best Souls game. However, I do not *completely* agree. It definitely has the potential, but here is where it fell flat for me (compared to other souls games): 1. Overwhelming initial difficulty - you just start with 1 flask and a pathetic health bar and almost no tools/skills at your disposal. And it takes a while to acquire some better gear, which is most of the time acquired by defeating bosses and mini-bosses - and most of those are very challenging. In other Souls game there is always a more linear difficulty progression. So it is quite understandable why some players just give up and never finish this game. 2. Underwhelming prosthetics, skills and upgrades - while they sound good on paper, and definitely are in the early to mid game, most skills and most prosthetics are simply not worth it in the end-game. I beat the game 3 times only using 2 of dozens of combat skills - Double Ichimonji and Mortal Draw. The other skills were either too under-powered or cost too many emblems or skill point investment. Most of the prosthetics were highly situational, so again I was using mainly 2 or 3 of them. 3. Replayability - as you may heard, Sekiro is a rhythm game and if you master the rhythm of deflecting, countering and pressuring your opponent - you are going to have a great time. And you need to master it in order to defeat some of the more challenging bosses However, once you master it, there is almost no incentive to come back. In other Souls games you can always experience something new, by starting a new character build, focusing on different set of weapons and upgrades, and so on... Still, I think it is a solid game that deserves to be experienced, especially for Souls fans. The feeling of overcoming a challenging boss after two hours of dying, and later destroying him in the first try on the second play-through or gauntlet, is unmatched! However, I think I have to put the game on the last spot in my Souls-ranking, to be shared with DS2",8,2024-11-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user
kezen,"It was so close to a 10. The combat is amazing, the artstyle is beautiful, the cinematics are epic, the boss fights are almost perfect. However, it tends to repeat areas and minibosses a lot. Are the areas and minibosses cool? Yes. Are they fun to interact with? Hell yes. Do they make the game look like it's lacking in content? I guess. Also, is it just me or do the characters in this game feel flat? Some characters do show emotion, however, i feel like most characters in this game are just too stoic and cold. I get that this is probably intentional to show the mannerisms of people in Sengoku Japan, however, a bit more of personality for each character would be nice. It is just unfortunate, but I do think that its combat system and artstyle carry this game hard and it is saved from receiving a lower rating.",9,2024-11-05,PLAYSTATION 4,user

pshort420,"Out of every game I've had the pleasure of playing throughout the years I believe this is the best of the bunch. I currently have played through this title 4 times to obtain each ending and each time I felt a sense of accomplishment with every time I beat another boss. Sure, I think someone could argue there is a sense of copy and paste with some of the minibosses but I think that's a minor problem since most can be skipped if you just so happen to choose so. The combat is also flashy and rewarding since it takes true time and effort to get good at it. The DS titles usually have a way to somewhat get around having to fight a certain boss whether it be through cheesing or straight up skipping it while Sekiro makes you go one by one. This is a title truly worth picking up and playing just once. The only thing that I would add in as a negative is the fact that I feel as if I didn't use my prosthetics almost ever. It seems like quite an interesting core mechanic that maybe I didn't fully understand. Nevertheless I unlocked all of them and tended to only use the firecrackers for the Guardian Ape.

ChessPiece01,"Sekiro is a game that has built up a reputation of being one of the most difficult games as of recent. For this exact reason is why consider my personal favourite game produced by from software. It's game that at it's core has elements of typical souls like games, mechanics such as 'bonfires', healing flasks and other similar elements that any souls fan would recognise are really put to use here with it's extremely different combat. From the beginning of the game, you'll notice these similar elements and as most people will, you will start off playing this game as you typically would a souls game. Expect, of course, the parrying mechanic. This is where I personally think serkio really shines, as you slowly play the game more you start to realise that simply dodging attacks won't cut it. Eventually, most people will hit a brick wall that is a particularly boss atop of ashina castle. This is where I, when I first played, got stuck. I was stuck into a continuous loop of death, but there is a moment where you really click with sekiros combat. The game really forces you to sit down and learn it's mechanics. Where most games are forgiving with it's combat, sekiro really pushes you to learn each bosses individual move, and the many possible ways of punishing them. The more fast pace and aggressive combat I never thought I needed. However, sekiros combat isn't just the only thing that I believe makes it from softwares best game to date. The world it's self has very stunning visuals, it makes use of the inherit beauty of Japan as occasionally youll be thrown a stunning visual of ashina. Overall, I could talk more about sekiro and what makes it my personal masterpiece, but of course this game is best experience on your own terms. The only recommendation I can give with this game is to go in blind, and of course hesitation is defeat.",10,2024-06-19,PLAYSTATION 4,user

jellyrilla,"Sekiro is probably the best game I've ever played. One of the best narrative pieces, the best gameplay loop, graphics that blew me away on my first playthrough, this game is stellar top to bottom. While I don't personally believe a video game can be ""perfect,"" Sekiro is about as close as one can come. The learning curve is the closest thing to a flaw I can find in this game. I eventually learned the gameplay loop and kind of mastered it, but it was a wildly frustrating process, and I've personally seen players quit due to the demanding combat system. Other than that nitpick there is quite literally nothing wrong with this game in my opinion. The story is a bit basic but serves this world and its characters perfectly. I love how tightknit the narrative is, rather than an overarching, in some ways uninvolved story. Every ending being wholly unique and requiring their own individual steps adds a TON to replayability, as does the extensive upgrade system. The bosses are also incredibly consistently good. Not a single boss in this game is overtly frustrating or boring in my opinion. They all had a unique moveset that was fun to learn and overcome, and also all visually impressed me time after time.

There is also zero payoff to killing bosses -- there's more of a ""good riddance"" feeling, rather than a ""good battle"" feeling after killing a boss that you've been bashing your head against the wall trying to eliminate for days. I hate the control scheme as well. I hate how repetitive it is, and I hate that it actively tries to punish you for dying. The Souls formula (and yes, I am going to relate it to the other ones, because they introduce the same dying mechanic, so I am going to criticize how they erred on it in this one) is perverted greatly by actively punishing you by dying more and more.

DigiConnoiseur,"Sekiro is a testament to exceptional gameplay, particularly evident in its combat system. The focus on precision and mastery sets it apart, offering a fast-paced, intense, and deeply satisfying experience. FromSoftware's refinement of Dark Souls' combat system shines through, with Sekiro's combat feeling like a dance of blade and reflex. Unlike traditional RPGs where progression hinges on character upgrades, Sekiro's progression is rooted in player skill. Mastery of Wolf's trusty katana, Kusabimaru, is paramount, allowing for creative approaches to encounters. Whether employing stealth and Ninjutsu techniques or unleashing Combat Arts alongside Prosthetic Tools, every encounter feels dynamic and purposeful. Graphics uphold the game's immersive atmosphere, blending gritty realism based on Japan's Sengoku era with fantastical elements inspired by Japanese mythology. While the story takes a backseat to gameplay, it provides a solid backdrop enriched by memorable characters and voice acting. Traversal is fluid and agile, mirroring the grace of combat. Wolf's mobility, including wall-jumping and grappling, adds depth to exploration, opening up verticality and strategic advantages. Level design, though linear, is meticulously crafted, offering branching paths and varied environments. While enemy variety is generally satisfying, certain areas may feel lacking in diversity, impacting the overall experience. Boss fights stand as the pinnacle of Sekiro's design, offering thrilling encounters that demand skill and adaptation. Each boss presents a unique challenge, with movesets mirroring those of regular enemies encountered throughout the game. The crescendo of techniques and strategies learned throughout the journey culminates in a gratifying finale. Despite its relatively shorter length compared to other FromSoftware titles, Sekiro's concentrated content ensures a rich and fulfilling experience. Overall, Sekiro emerges as a standout masterpiece, showcasing FromSoftware's prowess in game design. With its emphasis on skill-based gameplay and meticulous attention to detail, Sekiro earns a well-deserved rating of 9.8/10.",10,2024-04-04,PLAYSTATION 4,user

It has the best combat system that i've ever seen - it's so flawless that I have no idea how it was possible to develop such game. This game is difficult - probably the hardest game that I've ever played but it's also fair. It's fair in a way that when you learn how to play you will just beat the game. It's definition of ""get good and get rewarded"". Unlike other souls game there's 0 rng involved in this game which is why it makes it so rewarding.

danctsm,"1 - it's not a Souls game, is a bad game based on pressing buttons at the right time. And this is really hard 2 - the right time to deflect is really fast, or extreme slow, just to frustrate you. 3 - it's a bad mix between spider man, metal gear solid and a rythm game 4 - standard ps4 version has not good fps, so you don't make right decisions sometimes. Furthermore, a lot of camera problems 5 - completely unbalanced. Lots of mobs surrounding mini bosses all the time. This is ridiculous because the game was designed to 1x1 combat 6 - most items are useless 7 - money is useless a lot of times as well 8 - bosses completely overpowered, you must decorate every movement and the correct time to increase a bar to a big blow 9 - you don't feel the same feeling as on Souls games, because you try and die a lot of times and it'stoo annoying 10 - there is just one weapon ingame 11 - you cannot customize almost anything, not even reset your character 12 - everybody knows that any other Souls game is way better than Sekiro, but they made it right on Elden Ring some years later. 13 - check for gameplays before buying.

cdsmith7,"Sekiro's combat is innovative, rewarding and has a steep learning curve. The world is detailed with elaborate layouts. Standard enemies and bosses are a joy to fight. The story was surprisingly not a cryptic mess but quite easy to follow. The reason I place this game below DS3 and Bloodborne is that several RPG elements have been removed. There are a variety of skills, prosthetics and consumables but you cannot customize character build, or loot armor and traditional weapons. You do get the mortal blade which is similar to Rivers of Blood, but aside from that you will not be fighting with different swords or other weapon types like spears, axes or clubs. Shrines next to bosses make the fights enjoyable but mini bosses, which are often more challenging, may have dozens of enemies you must mind numbingly kill every time you want to practice a fight. FromSoftware, as expected, has made a great game. I just don't see the replay value as being on par with DS3 and certainly not Bloodborne.",8,2020-03-31,PLAYSTATION 4,user

BaakaMeechy,"This game is my Nindo, my ninja way. This was my first fromsoft title I played to completion (4 times for all endings). I feel like a major roadblock to soulsborne, along with the difficulty, is the generally slow pace at which the games take place. Sometimes you need to take out areas one enemy at a time and movement in souls games had been basically the same throughout the franchise. Sekiro dialed speed to 11 and switched guard for parry. As a ninja with a customizable prosthetic tool, a sword, and a lord to save, you quickly leap into action and start kicking major ass. Words fail to describe how good it feels to parry an enemy and then deliver a fatal blow. Characters are cool and the story is more streamlined and easy to follow (at times) than other souls games. Biggest gripe with the game is lack of expansions.",10,2023-12-01,PLAYSTATION 4,user
flying_leaves,"I spent two days with this game. I tried to beat one enemy, an ogre, at least 15 times. It reminded me of Sigrun in God of War, but in that case, there was an easy mode option, which this game doesn't provide. I realised I was just wasting my time - and importantly, having no fun at all. Based on what I saw, I think that the developers deliberately made the bosses almost impossibly difficult to hide the lack of content in the game. Their refusal to include an easy mode in an update seems to confirm this. It occurred to me quite early on that without the difficulty of the fights, the game wouldn't contain much, and this would become very obvious with an easy mode. Compared to other games, the cutscenes are lifeless and the visuals are unimpressive. As for the story, I still don't actually know what I was supposed to be doing, as there wasn't any clear objective. I'm not a programmer, but I assume that the amount of health you lose when you get hit will be defined by a single parameter - a number in a line of code. Likewise for the amount of damage you inflict on an enemy. These parameters are chosen at will by a group of developers in an office somewhere in Japan. So to waste literally days trying to beat a virtual enemy, fighting him again and again and again, would be to become a slave to the whims of those developers. It wouldn't be an achievement - not to me anyway. At the very least, this game was an eye-opener. It shows how a studio can make players think they are playing an amazing game simply by making fights impossibly difficult. Vaas' definition of insanity comes to mind.",0,2023-11-28,PLAYSTATION 4,user

FuriousAegon,"Sekiro : Shadows Die Twice is my second favorite FromSoft game since **** main thing of thing that differs this game from other FromSoft game is actual plot and decent **** plot is simple, but u can also empathize lots of characters like Kuro, Sekiro, Emma , Owl, Isshin ( before his boss appearance ) these all very interesting characters by their lore and impact to the story.Also the story endings of this game are far more dramatic than from other souls **** me gameplay of this game is the best thing that FromSoftware ever produced.Very aggressive, fast, and requires skill from player to successfully parry and remember move set of boss.There‚Äôs only one minus for me in this gameplay - when face a really hard boss like Isshin ( both as Sword Saint and Ashina ), Owl ( Father ), Genichoro , True Monk the one and only 100% way to kill them is to remember their move set and increase their posture by parrying their attacks that you can‚Äôt do without move set knowledge, and in this situation skill won‚Äôt help‚Ä¶There‚Äôs tons of good bosses in this game Isshin (both variations), Owl (Father), Divine Dragon, Guardian Ape, Genichoro Ashina, Lady Butterfly, Demon of Hatred these are the shining expanse of perfect boss **** Father and Isshin Sword Saint are in my top 5 favorite bosses of all **** fight against them is feels dramatic because of the plot and **** example from fight versus Owl Father is really intense because you already fought your father, but now he‚Äôs from the past and even stronger, also music intensives your feelings of fight and you can feel fury of Owl and Sekiro in this **** about Isshin, of course he is the hardest boss in the game, and I spent about 50-60 attempts to beat him in my first play trough, but now I beat him in most cases without taking any **** I mastered this fight, but it was a huge struggle to learn his move set and trying to beat him for 1,5 days. Most of the locations of this game are gorgeous and level-designed **** only location I don‚Äôt like is Sunken Valley it is very boring and poor on content, also comparing with good locations like Senior Temple,Ashina Castle & Outskirts ,Hirata Estate.Also Fountained Palace is the most beautiful location of the game, but it has really stupid enemies like monks that drain your life ; Monks-Knights/Archers/ they are annoying as hell but in other aspects this location is good.After getting platinum and spending around ~150 hours in the game I can clearly say that if you‚Äôve played dark souls or Bloodborne it is worth trying out, you might not enjoy the combat system or lore & story, but I think everyone would enjoy these incredible boss **** as my 2nd favorite FromSoft game and Top 10 in my Favorite Games list i think it deserves 9.5/10.Hesitation is defeat‚Ä¶",9,2022-04-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Santa01003,"A great rhythm game. From software did something monstrous creating Sekiro's combat system, so much so that many games have taken inspiration from or sometimes copied the aforementioned development house. We are talking about the best souls from an objective point of view, certainly the one most based on the player's skill and the most honest towards him(let's be clear, in software games you don't always die through your own fault and the road to the boss of the moment is often frustrating given the heaviness conveyed by the slowness of the character and the long path littered with annoying minions. In this case, however, the grappling hook and the speed of the protagonist make everything more immediate and satisfying). Only on the auditory level did I find some problems, for example in situations where enemies are eavesdropped the sound is unrealistically muffled, considering that you are often just a few meters away from them. All bosses can be learned and you always get to the point of knowing them enough to beat them without a scratch, apart from the Demon of Hatred, that i fuond totally out of place in context of Sekiro. Another flaw found is the input lag, certainly not game breaking but rather limiting at the beginning",9,2023-10-25,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Zski,"To start with my history with Souls games. I never liked any of them, at all, until Elden Ring, which I absolutely loved. I read that the next most accessible game is Sekiro, so after my great experience with Elden Ring, I decided to give this one a shot. I‚Äôll start with the positives. The story/lore is a bit confusing but highly intriguing. Since I now understand how the story works in these games, I can appreciate what is being presented, especially since it‚Äôs a bit more active story telling compared to Elden Ring. The way they weave the story and lore into the atmosphere of the game is excellent, which really plays into the overall presentation of the setting. The graphics are very good, although nothing memorable. Mix that with a soundtrack that does the job exceptionally well despite not being memorable in any way, and it‚Äôs a great feeling game. My issue, as it always was with Souls games, is the combat. I‚Äôm still having the same experience I always had with these games where I feel that the control of the character is just too loose. The slightest movement of the stick makes your character completely pivot all over the place, luckily the lock on mechanic makes it feel a little more grounded, but I hate to say it, the control of the character feels cheap. It almost feels dated, like a PS2 era game. I thought the hookshot and the prosthetic weapons work well and really enhance maneuverability compared to other games I played, but when that‚Äôs combined with the floaty controls, it feels like you have no weight in any of your actions. So I have mixed feelings about it - the maneuverability makes it feel more action based, which ironically sets up the stealth, but the way you‚Äôre forced to use it makes it lame. Maybe I‚Äôm not understanding, but the 1 on 1 fights are fun, it can be fun learning the patterns. Despite dying over and over, those segments were fun enough to give me that feeling where I knew what I did wrong, and immediately go into trying the fight again. But when there are more than one enemy present, the combat completely falls apart. It just feels like you back up a little, isolate an enemy and damage them a little bit until the group catches up, back up a little, isolate an enemy, then rinse wash and repeat. After about 6 hours with the game, I find that it‚Äôs time for me to put the game down. It has its moments, but I find that I spend a lot of mental energy convincing myself that it‚Äôs not that bad. If I spend most of my time with a game convincing myself that I‚Äôm having fun, it‚Äôs not really that fun. I can see how people enjoy it, but it‚Äôs just not for me. I gave it my best, and the weird loose grip of the character and floaty movement combined with decent combat made it hard to feel like I care enough to go on.",6,2023-10-10,PLAYSTATION 4,user

agendafu,"Title: A Soulslike Triumph of Perseverance - 10/10 Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is the epitome of a Soulslike experience, and it revels in the unrelenting suffering that comes with each encounter. FromSoftware, the studio renowned for its challenging and immersive titles, has crafted a masterpiece that embraces the essence of the Soulslike genre, demanding players to endure countless trials and tribulations. As an ardent fan of their previous works, I came to Sekiro with high expectations, and it not only met but far exceeded them. 1. Unforgiving Combat Mastery (10/10) Sekiro's combat system is a relentless and unforgiving test of one's mettle. It's a dance of death that demands precision, timing, and tactical brilliance with each strike. The posture system, a departure from traditional health bars, intensifies the suffering, rewarding players who can perfectly parry, deflect, and break their foes' posture for the exhilarating coup de gr√¢ce. Every enemy is a harsh teacher, a puzzle to be solved with every encounter, where a single misstep can lead to agonizing defeat after agonizing defeat. 2. A World Steeped in Desolation (10/10) Sekiro masterfully crafts an atmospheric rendition of Japan's Sengoku era, invoking a sense of desolation and melancholy. From the crumbling Ashina Castle to the ominous depths of the Sunken Valley, the game's world is painstakingly detailed, hiding secrets around every corner. Level design, a hallmark of FromSoftware, is a labyrinthine masterpiece, intertwining paths that encourage exploration and discovery. The attention to detail immerses players in a world teeming with sorrow and peril. 3. The Agony of Storytelling (10/10) Sekiro's narrative is a gripping journey filled with morally complex characters, where suffering and vengeance are the central themes. The story delves into questions of honor, loyalty, and the harrowing price of retribution. The silent protagonist, Wolf, compels players to wrestle with their emotions, and his relentless journey will haunt players long after the controller is set aside. 4. Aesthetic Torture (10/10) Sekiro's visuals and audio are an exercise in tormenting beauty. Environments are exquisitely rendered, characters pulsate with raw emotion, and the haunting soundtrack, composed by Yuka Kitamura, gnaws at your soul, amplifying the game's somber atmosphere. Sekiro's artistic direction pushes the boundaries of visual and auditory artistry, plunging players into a world where suffering and beauty coexist. 5. Excruciating Boss Encounters (10/10) Sekiro's bosses stand as monuments of anguish and triumph, embodying the very essence of the Soulslike genre. They are punishing and unrelenting, designed to push players to the brink of despair. Each boss requires meticulous strategy and demands patience, making each victory a euphoric release of frustration after numerous, agonizing attempts. Whether facing the towering Guardian Ape, the enigmatic Owl, or the relentless Genichiro, the road to success is paved with suffering, making each triumph that much sweeter. In summary, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is a testament to the Soulslike genre, a relentless trial of skill and perseverance that few games can match. FromSoftware has crafted an experience that revels in the player's suffering, a symphony of agony and ecstasy. If you seek a gaming journey that will test your resolve, Sekiro is the crucible where your determination will be forged anew with every grueling encounter. Surrender to the brutal beauty of this masterpiece, and prepare to die countless times on your path to glory.",10,2023-09-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user

CnPx98,"Must have been a dry year for games for this to get game of the year. It's just got so many hateable aspects for what could have been a much better game. Bossing in this game just isn't that fun. They go on for a boringly long time and it's the same from start to finish. Remnants weren't their at launch at so people just turn them off. This leaves you with empty remnants of people just running round in a circle as if they were trying to work out what it does. You mite get the odd useful one but you'll skip over these because you have to select loads of useless ones to find the useful ones. By then you can just work out where it would take you anyway. Crosses what restore the prosthetic arm are a bootable and not restoring with the bonfire is stupid. Healing items in this game are basically non existent and it relies more on not getting hit at all. Which is fine but getting hit once by a boss is either 1 or 2 hit death. Basically making this game a 0 room for error type deal. Again this would be fine if every boss instance was just a boss but 10 enemies aswell. Some ranged, melee, boss charging at you. But your ranged attack is basically like throwing marshmallows. I've completed a few of From Softs souls games and sekiro is not really souls bourne but it's still difficult. But I find the difficulty in Sekiro more of an unfair kind. Stealth keeps breaking. You get a backstab indicator but il go to press it when it's on and il just them with my sword alerting everyone. Enemies follow you when they didn't see you go there rather then following the route you took. Say I run round a building threw some bushes and grapple onto a tree. They will skip over everything and lock onto where I am. Like how they know that? It's really immersion breaking. Or you kill an enemy 5 miles away in a noisy area and everyone will turn around and look at you? They will walk over their best mates dead corps like meh there goes another one. Why they not go into a search mode? For a game that revolves around stealth there isn't very much stealth options and the stealth is terrible. The skill tree **** and has nothing interesting out of the 10 things on it. The map design feels extremely fake and un-interesting. It's like an extremely long and narrow cliff everywhere you go in this game. Its like 10 steps to the left is 1 side and to the right is the other side. For a from software game there is literally 0 exploration. Sometimes you'll get the odd jump down onto platform area and that's about it. Think in Demon Souls or Dark souls 1 all the shortcuts leading back to the bonfire and it's awesome to see how the map felt like a giant spider web. Nope Sekiro is just 1 narrow path everywhere. Sekiro is great for is the story. But that's to be expected with these devs. And the core combat is pretty good outside of stealth and most bosses. I also love the way how everyone in the world is there for a reason. This is something From have always done that's awesome. No one just ignores you. I just felt the game could have used a little more polish in certain areas but I would imagine Activision being the publishers they had strict deadlines and had to have a meeting about what colour an NPCs clothes were. From Software have never gone back to them since so I'm guessing Bandai Namco is better to work with.",7,2023-08-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user

PJMZdanowski,"Amazing game! My story with Sekiro is complicated. I bought it when it won GOTY but I played for maybe 2 hours and sold the game. It seemed brutal and not well designed. Some time later with PS5 I bought Demon Souls for launch. I played the **** out of it. It's a beautiful remake if you haven't played it. I went through most of the game, I advanced much more then the first time I played it on PS3. I think it because of the fact the loadings are so much faster now, so when you die you don't have to go and make a tea, before you can jump right back. Still did not finish it, because I was distracted by Returnal. OMG Returnal is perfect. Mind bending SF lore and hard fights that made my heart pumping adrenaline like nothing before... and then there was Elden Ring. By that time Returnal made me thirsty for a challange, so Elden Ring was excellent. Zelda like exploration, but better??? How is it even possible!? You stumble on to the lift and you spend next 3 days killing Dragon God who lives under the monster-ant kingdom in a long forgotten underground human civilnization. Amazing! And hard fights! Emotions so powerful, impossible really to describe. Once it ended I had to finish Demon Souls, which suddenly became extremely easy:) Once I got back to it, not only I killed the boss I was stuck on in second try... I basically sprinted through the rest of the game almost without dying. The final boss I got on my first try:) I got gud ;) Then Jedi Knight quickly which gave me a fix of FS... and Kena that contrary to her looks is a challenge with some bosses.... but I needed more... so I bought Dark Souls Trilogy... :D DS1 - cool, but to old... I will probably finish it after Sekiro... where I'm going... But DS3? This is the next level **** Great bosses, better then ER and really good graphics and fluency in 60fps. Loved it! I tried Bloodborne... it's ok but too old and clunky... same with DS2 - clunky as hell, actually looks worse then DS1 remaster... so after DS3 and all it's DLCs I bought Sekiro again, because many people say it's the best FS game... What can I say? iI you read all the way to this worlds and your journey and tastes, at least partially, align... then I think you will be enchanted by it. It's not that hard and you will have a blast with exploration, rythmic combat and cool lore. It's all so nicely packed into so many cool and tight mechanics... and there so cool secrets and suprises along the way... even the smallest details are really cool. Yeah. it's an almost perfect game! As close as game can be... I don't know yet if this is better then DS3... will see:) but the time spent with it, is definetely worth it.",10,2023-07-10,PLAYSTATION 4,user

hazukimio,"Sekiro: Shadow Die Twice is the least soul-like game FromSoftware had developed. Being different from other soul-like games based on defense, counterattack, and dodging enemy skills, Sekiro encourages players to be offensive. With the flawless art design and the pleasure when you collide your blades with enemies, Sekiro is FromSoftware's best interpretation of the charm of Japan's Sengoku period. But at the same time, Sekiro doesn't have as much depth in the combat system like other soul-like game with a wider choice of weapons and genres, such as Dark Souls and Elden Ring. This, along with the overall slightly insufficient volume, is one of Sekiro's few drawbacks. However, I have to admit that these defects could be very personal.

Ginger_Avenger,"OK - It's a departure from the usual by Miyazaki- I get some people's disappointment. I love this game, and it's certainly not perfect, nor is it perhaps as replayable as the Souls games, but I understood from the start that It's an action game, not really an action RPG. Also, concerning one of its most talked about features: maybe I have just improved at this type of game in recent years, but I feel like there is a bit too much exaggeration about the game difficulty- it seems like some people were not adapting to the fight style available, and that might have added to the challenge and frustration. You have the one weapon, a few handfuls of skills, items, and tools, and that's it. It's the same familiar experience from From (see what I did there?) of getting better and surmounting the seemingly impossible, just with only one specific character build and fighting style. I liked the focus on deflect and posture as it allows two ways to defeat enemies, draining their life bar or filling their posture damage bar. If you don't like to deflect, then maybe you will not enjoy this game as much as I did, but it's an oversimplification to say that the game is only about deflecting as that strategy will not really work on some bosses (anyway, there is the usual cheese available for a lot of them). I also generally liked the addition of the stealth mechanics and also grappling hook and more vertical design of many levels. And the world of the game is very beautiful and well designed. Overall, I prefer the non-Souls From Soft games like this and Bloodborne and I didn't try this wanting to play Dark Souls in Sengoku Japan. Sekiro is its own type of game, and gave me mostly great fights and a decent challenge. Like any From Soft game, I feel there are some lower tier boss battles, so there were a couple of true peak and valley moments where a great and fun boss was followed soon after by a mini boss or boss that was head scratching or made obnoxious by an unreliable camera in closed quarters. Bloodborne is still the king of the From games for me, but this game often came close to taking that crown.",9,2023-05-07,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Cyrus666,"Number Of Playthoughs: 4 Platinum Trophy Total Playtime: Nearly 70 hours Where do I begin with this game? I don't know how From Software managed to create this masterpiece. It is easily one of the greatest games I have ever played. Sure the first run was a bit difficult when I was still learning the ropes but after I learned all the tricks it just clicked with me. If people say it is hard and unfair I have to say that they gave up too soon before learning the combat. Soulslike genre isn't for the faint-hearted. One huge difference it has compared to other soulslikes is the fact that you must unlearn most of what you've learned during other soulslikes and approach this game from a new perspective. The new posture mechanic instead of stamina and deflecting mechanic. The only problem I had with the game is that some of the bosses are used more than once during a playthrough. And it gets boring during multiple playthroughs. Overall, it was one hell of an experience. 10/10",10,2023-04-11,PLAYSTATION 4,user

sickfabe06,"I mean, what can I say... Arguably the greatest FromSoftware game ever made, and one of the greatest, if not THE greatest game ever released in the history. The combat system is flawless, very very satisfying, the absence of stamina is a great idea, because it helps you to keep your head fully focused on your enemy, and less focused on yourself. The removal of level-upgrading is the thing that makes this game drive away from the Souls saga, and I personally LOVE IT. Now it's not your character that is getting better, but YOU are actually getting better! The movement system is great and it fits perfectly with the game, because your character can be moved in a very quick manner, and the agility is one of the most important skills that a Shinobi has to have. Also the possibility to resurrect is a fantastic feature in my opinion. And finally, the last boss is probably the best boss I ever fought against. I'm not giving it a 10, because there are still some annoying bosses, some bosses that you need to buff yourself to be able to have a chance to beat, and 1 thing that FromSoftware needs to understand, and I'm not talking only about sekiro, but every souls game: When I am healing, I must be untouchable just for those 2 seconds !!! Bosses often wait for you to heal to attack, because your character is busy doing that animation and they can hit, and you obviously can't do anything to avoid it (and if I'm healing, I do it to gain some hp, not to loose even more",9,2023-01-31,PLAYSTATION 4,user

80sChild,"I don't get the love for this game. It's definitely broken, but its received with praise as a ""challenging FromSoft game"" from gaming's worst developer: Hidetaka Miyazaki. If you think challenge = gimping the player by making enemies op and the player attacks hit like a water balloon, then yes its very ""challenging"". Lets be honest: without the artificial difficulty, the game would probably be 4-8 hours long, its the same **** tactic Miyazaki always uses to squeeze blood from a penny. The media and their sheep-like followers praise his games but look at the achievements on ANY platform: 10-20% completion rate for ANY game he makes. BeSt GaMe EvA! Enemies (all of them) rotate on invisible lazy susans to track you when you use dodge (making dodge pointless). Archers fire arrows that clearly change course (in the air! Lol) to track you. Enemies rarely react to being hit and their attacks can seldom be interrupted. Theres a specific move you can get for ""crowds"", I have yet to use it without an enemy interrupting it (and ignoring the move itself). Old, broken and poorly designed combat system lends to the games ""difficulty"" as you can really only engage in one on one scenarios. Camera system is horrendous is tight areas. Stealth isn't stealthy as enemies are always alerted when you perform a ""stealth"" attack. Its an old, outdated, broken design that is inexplicably excused away as ""challenging"", in almost all From games. More modern, polished games like Ghost of Tsushima allow the player to take on upwards of 20 enemies at once with combat systems that function properly. If you like broken, poorly designed games because they're ""difficult"" where said ""difficulty"" only exists to hide the lack of actual content: This is your game.",0,2022-12-11,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The continual grind, dying over and over doesn't appeal to me. I simply don't have time for it. I can't do it any more.

Ic3_winterhell,"Sekiro es una combinaci√≥n entre shinobi, Onimusha y un Souls, si has jugado esas franquicias imagina una mezcla de ambos y el core de los souls(con todo y su dificultad elevada), aunque tiene mas de los souls que los otros juegos. En cuanto el combate, en este juego es fundamental cubrir y hacer parrys a diferencia de bloodborne o darksouls que puedes abordar las peleas esquivando ataques, cosa que en sekiro solo sirve para un tipo de ataque enemigo. En su contra puedo decir que es mucho menos variado que un darksouls, solo cuentas con un arma en casi todo el juego y tienes una pr√≥tesis que sirven como arma secundaria, pero lo anterior es muy poco a diferencia de todas las combinaciones que podr√≠as hacer en un souls Algo muy positivo de este juego, es que te cuenta la historia de una manera mas clara que los dem√°s juegos de Fromsoftware, al tener un personaje predeterminado, tu personaje no se siente como un hueco de DS si no como un verdadero shinobi con sentimientos e intereses. Lo anterior puede ser positivo o negativo dependiendo de lo que est√©s buscando. En lo que si se lleva un 10 es en la exploraci√≥n, donde al igual que DS1 sus mundos est√°n interceptados y se siente muy bien el ir descubriendo los √≠dolos (Hogueras de descanso) pero va mas all√°, con su sistema de Gancho salto y sigilo, con lo anterior puedes abandonar una pelea si te sientes superado y escapar para despues esconderte (algo como Assasins creed combinado con metal gear). Lo anterior hace que te dientas muy agil por los escenarios y no como en una ratonera como en DS o Bloodborne. En cuanto al sistema de progresi√≥n las cosas son muy distintas a DS, ya que no tienes estad√≠sticas solo puedes subir el nivel de ataque, la salud, el da√±o a la postura y la cantidad y calidad de tus curaciones. Las resistencias al veneno, miedo y dem√°s estad√≠sticas se compensan con consumibles que te dan o puedes comprar y que te suben est√°s resistencias. En General es de aplaudir que Fromsoftware adapta su formula con otros tipos de Gameplays, algo solo Nioh ha podido hacer bien, sin embargo hay decenas de juegos como Lords of the fallen, the surge y dem√°s que han fallado en el intento.

mrwarcriminal,"Ok. WOW! What a fantastic game. There‚Äôs only a few game series I play as soon as they release. Dead Space, God of War, many of the Lego Games & now From Software games. Bloodborne was my first & after that i started playing the backed up games. Dark Souls, DSIII, didn‚Äôt like DSII then Elden Ring & recently Sekiro. At first it‚Äôs incredibly difficult. I played through the game twice before becoming what I would consider to be proficient. If you want to cheese many bosses there are ways but that is cheating yourself out of a lot of satisfaction & fun. The game can be finished w/4 endings. One ending is about 60% if the full game the typical ending is about 95% of the game. There‚Äôs a lot of fighting techniques Sekiro can learn to make fights more difficult, easy, interesting & easy. Attack power is upgraded after defeating major bosses & using the memory to upgrade. So grinding for attack power doesn‚Äôt work. You have to learn the fight. Maybe a skill can help & that can be a grind objective; along w/Sen (gold). A very different From Software game that feels right at home because of the excellent boss, character, level & fight designs. I do think Sekiro is the most difficult From Software game I‚Äôve played but it‚Äôs fair & that‚Äôs most important. Don‚Äôt skip this game & if you do play don‚Äôt give up. I‚Äôm on NG+6 & some fights are still difficult. I still die a couple times or more to some bosses.",9,2022-09-10,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Joyasanactofres,"I love this game. The combat in this game is the most thrilling, invigorating, and engaging combat systems I've ever had the pleasure of seeing. It doesn't feel like a fight but rather a duel with enemies. The bosses are well-designed, high-octane, and brutal - which is what I expect out of Fromsoftware - but they really outdid themselves in this game. Highly recommend.

Timenick,"This game was a huge disappointment for me at launch and it has only gotten worse after I played Elden Ring. Sekiro is japanese Dark Souls but most of the good stuff is gone. - Worst customization of the series, because there isnt any. - Worst gameplay of the series. Fromsoftware can make games with a hundred weapons that all feel great, so if they make a game with just one weapon it would result in absolutely god tier gameplay, right? No. Its just one dimensional Katana bashing all the time and nothing else. Not really better than using a Katana in all their other games. Gets boring after the first few areas. Also it straight up doesnt work when fighting multiple enemies at once and all the other minor problems these games have (bad camera, weird hit boxes etc) are still there. - Worst online of the series because there isnt any as well. No coop, no pvp, nothing. - Worst overall content of the series, most bosses and all mini bosses and even some areas get reused multiple times. 3x Ashina castle, really? This is lazy. All the other Souls games have way more content and Elden Ring is probably ten times bigger than Sekiro. - Besides that its not better than the other games at anything. Bloodborne and DS3 still have the same or even better overall quality than Sekiro and ER and the Demon¬¥s Souls Remake absolutely dunk on it. If Elden Ring is a $60 game Sekiro would be $5. Good that Fromsoftware got away from this misguided garbage.",4,2022-08-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user

BobsityJonesity,"Sekiro has possibly the most fun combat mechanics out of any game I have ever played. There's not a moment of boredom while fighting enemies or bosses, and every hit feels satisfactory. Since the game is a fromsoft title, it takes a while to get adjusted, but the game does a fantastic job at slowly getting one used to the blocking and dodging mechanics. The movement system also combines seamlessly with the rest of the gameplay. The locations are interesting to explore and there are enough set pieces here to emphasize the beauty of the world they created. The bosses in this game too are easily the most consistently great in any game I've ever played. The fighting mechanics allow for interesting and challenging fights which really shine brightest with the final fight. A substantial issue I have however is that there are a decent amount of repeat fights here. almost half the bosses and mini-bosses one fights are repeats with some alterations. Now, while the alterations often do change enough to make the second fights compelling, it still feels odd that in a game this polished there also exists a stunning lack of diversity. But, the high points of this game heavily outweigh the negatives and overall one likely wont be too concerned with the lack of diversity of fights while playing due to the fluid and great feeling gameplay that surrounds it.",9,2022-08-20,PLAYSTATION 4,user
9bb,"Finally from-software tries something new again! This review is from the perspective of a returning souls player that have played ds1 ds3 bloodbourne and demon souls. The new combat is a new welcome addition. The new movement and vertical level designs makes for a new Experience that doesn‚Äôt feel like from soft is treading similitude ground. If you are a returning souls player that wants exactly the same experience you might be put of because it is different. The customized build variety has been traded for a more focused and simply put much better combat system. This is a game that knows what it wants to accomplish and does so very well. I do have a few minor very subjective complaints though. The world feels less very inspired but still a bit less creative and surprising than previous world entries. But this is because it is more reality based and that‚Äôs okay, just personal preference. The pop up tutorial systems are a steep downgrade from previous game tutorials. I will also say that the amount of repeat minibosses are tedious. And that the ability to absorb coins and items although conviniant is very immersion breaking. Also the GODAMM MONKEY DUO FIGHT IS THE WORST IN THE ENTIRE SERIES. I don‚Äôt ever wanna hear anymore complaints about ‚ÄúOh the ds2 duo bosses are the worst‚Äù because goddam this is the worst duo fight ever it does not work and abandons everything this game was built around. 1v1, this was also abit true for games like ds1 but since the combat system was less focused and somewhat less built around 1v1 you could make it justifiable to create 2v1 fights. Not in sekiro though. Still I am very happy to see fromsoft get out of their comfort zone and try something new. Heavily recommended",9,2022-08-06,PLAYSTATION 4,user

I found the game significantly easier than my first time. When you know what you are doing and you hit all of your parries, the game feels amazing. The style is awesome.

amechudo,"A masterpiece! As long as you leave your gaming preconceptions at the door, and open yourself to the combat mechanics that From Software carefully crafted on this title, you will have a blast! Initially, I tried to play this game with my usual approach: keep dodging, have patience, mind your position, and look for an opening to punish your adversary‚Ä¶ And doing this just brought me pain, anger and frustration‚Ä¶ I kept dying and dying and dying. I did not understand what was happening! Sekiro took me out of my comfort zone, and forced me to change the way I usually approach games like this‚Ä¶ I had to be aggressive, set the tempo of the fight, and properly learn and rely on new or rarely used mechanics‚Ä¶ And it was a wonderful experience. It is funny how as soon as you embrace Sekiro‚Äôs combat system, everything clicks. You really feel like a ninja, dominating parries, mikiri counters, and jumps, while also throwing yourself right in the face of bosses and dominating them‚Ä¶ At some point you feel that is the boss the one that should be worried because you are unstoppable! Less flexibility is the price to pay to have such a refined combat experience. Thank you From Software for pushing the genre and bringing such unique experiences for us to enjoy. Have patience, learn the mechanics, and be aggressive‚Ä¶ And you will have a wonderful time with Sekiro.",10,2022-06-16,PLAYSTATION 4,user

They modified the game style that existed in the previous games, and that they went back to in Elden Ring which should tell you something. They gave you a ton of options while roaming the general map but all your boss fights are the same. You are locked into a parry combat style which make boss fights maddeningly long compared to any other souls title because you arent really able to innovate, which is where my disappointment lies. Almost all the boss fights feel the same and are unnecessary long.",3,2022-06-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The combat system is so unique, innovative and brilliantly carried out that for me even the very high difficulty doesn't affect the joy of fighting in a bad way. On the contrary, the difficulty forces you the internalize the art of fighting like a shinobi and adds to the feeling. With this combat system I always felt like I have the abilities to defeat my opponents, I was sure through hard work I will gather the skills to succeed even in the hardest fights. Unlike some bosses in the Dark Souls games, Sekiro always gave me the faith and confidence that I will overcome the challenge I am facing.

Dperks,"I really hated this game at first. I felt that it was extremely difficult and unfair and really hard to just get a grasp of how to play the game. But I kept playing and eventually it clicked and now I'm in love with this game. I like many people came into this expecting a souls like game but instead its more of a character action, stealth game that burrows a lot of ideas from dark souls. Instead of making your own character there only one character Wolf and with the lack of customization to play styles there usually a right way to play the game and because of that I feel this hurts the replay value when compared to the souls games. But its kind of unfair for us to keep comparing this to Dark Souls because this game is trying to be something else and it does a damn good job at it. While things like checkpoints, death mechanics and brutal difficulty are carried over from FromSoft's other games this one has a more stealth and one on one dual focus to it. And while the game is quite difficult it felt really rewarding to master and combat is just really fun once you get the hang of it. Countering is a big part of if you cant learn to counter enemies then your not gonna have a great time. Some enemies require you to counter them if you want to realistically take them down and it can be daunting. I feel like I didn't get the hang of the mikari counter until I fought the final boss so yes it is hard but trust me if you have the patience its worth it. So other then the combat what else did I like about the game well the setting of feudal Japan was a nice change of pace for FromSoft games and overall the game look's really good. The story is actually not that hard to follow unlike many of their other games. That's not to say its not cripted because it still is in many ways but at the very least you will have an idea of what's going on at all times. And I really liked the story of Sekiro exploring new areas and learning more about Ashina was really interesting. And the highlight of the game would have to be the bosses with some very good bosses in this game. There's a lot of mini bosses to but id say most of them are alright but a few definitely throwaway encounters or just really annoying. My favorite bosses would have to be the guardian ape and the divine dragon one for its challenge and the other just because its fun to fight with out being super difficult. Overall Sekiro is really good if I had to criticize it I would say it's maybe a bit to hard in some spots and trying to get all the skills to get the trophy required some annoying grinding and I wish you could upgrade your defensive capabilities in some way other then just getting more HP. But those are small complaints that don't really take away from the overall experience.",9,2022-04-30,PLAYSTATION 4,user

PhillusMaximus,"So I bought this game the first time it came out and wasn't too happy with it. Was already hoping for elden ring at that time and sold it again after an initial playthrough. Rated it at around 6-7. I bought this game again a few weeks ago, put my already made opinions aside and completly let in on the experience. Mainly because I started replaying the souls games after elden rinf and because I saw so many beatiful fight montages, that I wanted to play it again very badly. Now after the second time playing it I got to admit, I did this game so wrong! The story is great (told a bit different than other from titles); gameplay is super flashy, fast and action filled; many new mechanics (some would later find their way in elden ring). What bothered me the most in my initial experience, were the limited customizations (gameplay and character wise) as well as the ridiculously high difficulty. HOWEVER, if you accept that this not dark souls and commit to learning the mechanics of this game, you'll quickly get a hang of it and realize, that the game isn't that hard if you don't try to dodge roll everything. The amount of skills in the game is huge and they look fantastic! Even if you are always a shinobi without option to ""switch your class"", it still changes the way you play immensely. I still think, that a few other katanas (even if it were only skins) or character skins (3 found their way into the game with a free dlc) wouldn't have hurt the game. But overall, this is an incredible game and I would love to see a sequel (or prequel?)",9,2022-04-29,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Not so with Sekiro. The game can definitely be Brutal at times but there was never a moment where I died and blamed it on the game. The combat is so clean and precise that it leaves no doubt that every failure is user error. It's clear what you did wrong and you know what you need to work on. Hang in there.

Dyldom,"Probably my most controversial gaming take of all time is that I think this game is really really poor. I‚Äôm a huge fan of fromsoft games, in fact I‚Äôve played every soulsborne game to completion at least once other than DS2. I really believe this game doesn't deserve to be in the same conversation as Dark souls and especially bloodborne. A lot of elements of this game feels like a step back from its predecessors including those that came out over a decade ago. For example cutscenes that lead into boss fights play every SINGLE time you approach the boss. Not only does this not make narrative sense in the context of the game, but its needlessly frustrating. Fromsoft seemingly recognised this when creating Demon Souls in 2009 and this issue is resolved in that game, so why not here? Other than it‚Äôs verticality, the world is, in my opinion, less interesting in both its design and art direction than the games that came before it bar a small number of locations. The grappling hook which should be an absolute game changer picks and chooses when to work properly, and the option for meaningful customisation in the build of your character is gone completely. The combat, while extremely satisfying and rewarding during 1on1s, falls apart completely when facing more than 1 enemy which might be fine if there isn't a non optional boss encounter based on fighting two bosses at once. This is not an interesting way of scaling difficulty, this is creating a situation that the combat mechanics are not built to handle well in order to make it difficult for the player to progress. I think this game falls short in almost every aspect of its direction, and I‚Äôm adamant it‚Äôs Game of the Year win is some inside industry joke that I‚Äôm not in on.",4,2022-02-19,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Mohamed_Bahr,"This game pushed the boundries of gameplay mechanics to a new high with this parry focused fight system. I moved from almost declaring it not doable first when trying it out, to then become so good at it and enjoy my montage worthy captured replays. This is a new genre of fight system in my opinion mainly because the game almost doesn‚Äôt approve of enemy health depletion by continuous striking. It can only be done through stagger meter depletion by continuous well timed parries. The lack of resources in the game and farming ability is clear but it greatly pours over to the need of getting better at the game rather than rely on charms and enhancement items. It also creatively pours over to the game‚Äôs replayability. Speaking of which, the replayability on this game is also great. I‚Äôm currently on my second play through, and I already see my self going for a third one. I‚Äôm just having so much fun going back to the before hard enemies with my newly gained expertise and beating them with style. I also love the idea of over powering some of them.

tuanchuong789,"Although I still think either Dark Souls 3 or Bloodborne is the best FROMSOFTWARE game so far, Sekiro is still an awesome, solid game and in my opinion, the game has the most satisfying combat system as they got rid of stamina and wanted players to go all out, but the game is still a challenging experience. To me, the game was super hard at first and could have been the most difficult out of all FROMSOFTWARE games, but the more familiar I got with the combat system, the less challenging the game became. Overall, it's a great game",9,2022-02-09,PLAYSTATION 4,user
MetalRobot69,"As a Souls series veteran, I was really surprised how good is the gameplay of this game. It is a lot faster than DS and has a three different types of dodges and those things make de combat system a lot more fun. The ambientation is incredible with gorgeous scenarios (Fountainhead Palace) and the variety of enemies and especially bosses is incredible there are bossies of different types and shapes, and all are very cool to face. The story when I played I really liked but after that, I forgot. It has some good plot twists but is a forgettable story because you don't have the same attachment to the characters as the games with really good stories that work on the characters that build up your attachment over time, like Atreus and Kratos relationship on God of War or the relationship among Arthur and his gang on RDR2. Here in Sekiro, I don't know exactly the protagonist and his Master (Kuro) and the game doesn't build up either, so the plot twists are cool, the story is cool but is forgettable because you don't really like the characters.",9,2022-01-31,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Brotelho,"Sekiro feels like a modern Bushido Blade game with adventure mode. It's unfortunate that those who pre-ordered this game thinking it was like Samurai Souls were disappointed. Sekiro is a fantastic adventure sword fighting game. It doesn't try to dazzle you with easy to perform combos. It doesn't throw heaps of enemies at you to make you feel like a god. Sekiro is a sword fighting game that requires discipline and intentional inputs. Those who think this is just a button mashing fighting game clearly never took the time to learn the mechanics of the game. Sekiro focuses on raw sword fighting. Once you learn the true mechanics of the combat system (once it all starts to ""click"") it truly is something unlike most games out there. Combos are not just handed to you on a plate. You are in control of your own combos. You make those combos on-the-fly while you clash swords with your enemies. Sekiro gives you a utility belt of tools and it's up to you on how you use them. Sekiro ages like fine wine as you continue to play and get better at the mechanics. Long time Souls fans may have forgotten what that feels like. They've forgotten the uphill battle of learning a Souls game. Sekiro is no different. For those will to learn Sekiro's mechanics will be rewarded with a unique combat system that feels incredible, lore that's just deep enough to be thought provoking, and a sense of confidence that's hard to replicate anywhere else. No game is without its faults and Sekiro is no different. Would be great to have a 1-on-1 PvP mode to challenge friends, but without PvP it is still a stellar game for those willing to learn and put in the work.",9,2022-01-13,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Jason0507,This games starts off well with its introductory sequence. However the story ends there and becomes an endless sequence of boss fights. Once you defeat one boss you have to navigate through one small section just to fight another. This formula repeats itself through out the whole game. With little to no story and just rinse and repeat gamplay this game is almost **** game looks amazing but it is just like putting lipstick on a pig. This game tries to mask its flaws with its difficulty. It's very challenging until you determine the attacks of the bosses then it's just a matter of time before you defeat them. It's a poor excuse for a game.,2,2022-01-11,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Blahblahuser,"I usually never rate games a 10 but this game deserves it. I was literally spellbound throughout my journey and I didn‚Äôt want it to end. I have only felt like this for a few games like BotW. Initially yes it did **** before I got the whole parry mechanic, but once it clicked nothing gave me much trouble as in the beginning. The locales and bosses are amazing I am a huge sword fight fan, and this game let me live my fantasy of sword fight to the death. The music works ok for the game even though it‚Äôs not my favorite type of music. There are no builds and no traditional leveling. Skills don‚Äôt do much as such the game is very balanced. It‚Äôs you, your sword and skills. The game honestly doesn‚Äôt require super ridiculous quick reflexes like most claim, but it does require observation. Noticing enemy animation and knowing that one thing the enemy does comes before something else. The only bad negative that I can give is that the camera doesn‚Äôt play nice particularly when you are in an arena that has obstructions like poles and doors. Often times you will end up in one of these places and the camera goes berserk and you trying to find the boss, because anytime you cannot view the boss your lock on targeting turns off. Sometimes I ended up between a door and the boss with no way to see what the hell was going on and difficulty in escaping this situation. Thankfully this doesn‚Äôt happen too often, but it is rather irritating. You will die a lot in your journey but this journey will be worth it.",10,2022-01-05,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Sensou,"Best game ever, definitely my number 1 game of all time. Tried Dark Souls and Bloodborne but just can't feel the excitement that all people have but Sekiro is different. The major factor might be the stamina bar which not exist in Sekiro so no more stamina management which affects the pacing of the gameplay, not a grinding game so I need to completely learn all the enemy pattern and experiment with all the prosthetic tools. The last is a satisfying parry mechanic which is the charm of this game. Story are also wonderful which you unlock and explore about it by yourself instead of the game leads you to the storyline. So, your decision and action will one way or another affect the story. Gameplay is no doubt the best game I've ever played as I've defeated this game 6 times now. Repetition is quite high to get all the story endings and of course to show how much you've improved throughout your gameplay. In conclusion, Sekiro completely change my mind of gaming nowadays in every aspects. Thank you FromSoft for the incredible journey you've created within this game. I know they are making another masterpiece right now which is Elden Ring but I do hope they didn't stop here with Sekiro type of game as I completely loving it.

Raios-Rogue,the hardest best Fromsoftware game ever created with the best narrative story plot awesome endings phenomenal character development awesome NPC the mind of Miyazaki is so creative full with so much fantasy innovation i loved every second of this game this game will make you a much better gamer and hone your skills that transfer into other games as long as you have patience and i am still playing it to this day this game is the hardest game ever made its not for everyone if for those games that are hardcore gamers that want to become god tier gamers its a game that pushes your brain capacity to the limit and the gamers that have the patience to beat this game to give back Kur's charm and play with demon bell and no kuro charm to master this game like me have my most utmost respect i even respect people that are not as good gamers but are stubborn and put effort into beating finishing this game even if they dont want to comeback and play more thats on them they will miss the other endings and secret boss fights. Sekiro is very punishing yer rewarding and requires you to get good at deflecting think of deflecting as rhythm getting your timing correct the combat is very good you have plenty of arts shinobi arts and your shinobi prosthetic arm to work with the combat is fast paced faster than bloodborne be aggresive on your attacks and you will need to have great reflexes being patient having good cordination and great timing dodging properly will get you a long way because later if you decide to futher punish yourself to master the game and improve your skills like me go without Kuro charm and + demon bell that means if you dont deflect perfectly you take damage bosses have so much more damage posture and health as do enemies and they break your posture very fast you gotta master deflecting and doding and using your prosthetic arm and shinobi tools and shinobi arts at the same time sometimes just perfect deflecting wont do you any good in NG + 2 you are already getting killed in one hit and bosses break your posture very fast as long as you dont give up and you have patience to continue dying and playing you will get better at the game you will build muscle memory faster reflexes your senses will sharpen it's a punishing game made for the soulsborne fans its made for the hardcore and god tier gamers which are at the top of skill in gaming this game is mength to test fully what you got it will push you to the limit you will either get better and push past your limit evolving your skills and enjoying how much better your getting and how much better you playing and you will enjoy the entire game or you will become the one thing in gaming disrespect the most a casul gamer that never wants to get stronger and improve and play games on easy or normal difficulty and when he clashes with a game like this he becomes a quiter a btch ass niga that will give up miss out on a phenomenal game and quit and run to play fortnite like a coward staying the same weakling casual scrub they always have **** biggest disappointed is where is our Expansion The Lighting of tomoe i mean thank you Miyazaki for the DLC you gave us with the boss rush and new skills but all of us fromsoftware fans would have loved The lighting of tomoe Expansion i really hope this game gets a sequel because Wuchant Fallen Feathers from The Chinese are already stealing from Sekiro and Bloodborne i would Prefer Sekiro Sequel From Fromsoftware and Miyazaki which are talented Japanese developers rather than having to play A female Sekiro Wuchag The Fallen feathers where they are absolutely stealing all if your sounds and animations UI From Sekiro and Bloodborne.This is a must play game for gamers that seek to attain greater skills by striving to improve to enjoy a great narrative story and a fantastic semi open world filled with so much innovation fantasy and a fatanstic combat system dont give up become stronger acquire strength think of death not as annoyance but as a new begining for you to keep trying and keep getting better.

winzentween,Amazing. Game of the year. Balls to the wall hard. Best souls like. Not for everyone are all accurate disruptions of this brilliant masterpiece. I found it a little short and too hard at times and the optional end area was a little sparse otherwise it be a 10. It looks like dark souls but it is entirely different and you'll have to learn a unique play style and master it to win in this extremely difficult game. But when you master it you'll be rewarded. Also you can cheat in most of the areas where you might become stuck. The story is messy and more about the environmental story telling. But there are multiple endings and hidden areas. The graphics are excellent for ps5 pro though the frame rate really suffers and it would be worth playing on ps5 or pc. The sound and music is perfect. The gameplay is fantastic and the game lasts about 30 to 50 hrs. Though I finished it fully in less time. It's a shorter game than prior souls like. There is no end game content of note though you can replay it. This game is one of the best ever made but you must stick with it. This is not like nioh or ds3 or got.

Lotex,"Pro: - Great story - Great characters - Good pace unless you go the wrong way too early - Good balance between stealth and combat - Great mix of bosses - Replay and Gaunlet option - Great boss variety, although some of them are somewhat recycled Cons: - EXTREMELY steep learning curve - Some enemies just deal obscene amounts of damage and take too much of a beating for being just regular guys - Tracking that is sometimes borderline infuriating (Chained Ogre for example) Overall I REALLY wanted to love the game from the beginning and in a way I did, I just couldn't get into the combat, so I played it a bit until I had to fight Genichiro and then dropped it, picked it up again a year later and dropped it again. This year I finally stayed on top of things, got gud and collected the last platinum for a From Soft game. Due to the missing co-op I'd say it is a great game for people that are either resistant to to frustration, that are good a both Soulsborne and rhythm games as the combat is kind of like a dance or that have a natural talent for anything new as Sekiro WILL force you to adept to this playstyle, unlike Dark Souls you can't hide behind a shield or get away with dodge all the time, you pretty much HAVE to parry/counter/deflect things. One thing I really didn't like all that much was the fact that you often had to seperate adds from their mini bosses which basically means you sneak up to them, kill the add, run away and wait for the boss to reset which is viable, but annoying when you die to them and you will over the span of the game. Some of these mini bosses have like 4 or more adds which gets old really quickly if you die to them.",8,2021-09-16,PLAYSTATION 4,user

And even if you'd found a way to beat a enemy, it would've never varied. It must be fun when you can find ways to improve your skills or strategies with some hints even if the difficulty is super high. Second of all, the voice of characters are awful. It's like the ones of Nintendo 64 or PS1. Non- native persons might not be bothered but for me as Japanese, it's hideous.

Sensou12,"Well well well, the best PS4 game in my opinion. Bought it on June and took me one month to reach Isshin and beat him. Believe me, I hate the game as I keep saying that I will put the game down and forget about it as the difficulty is insanely hard. But decided to spend at least 1 hour with the game per day and all of sudden, for the last 2 week before I finish the game, I put down all my ps4 game and completely just playing Sekiro for 14 days straight. The reason for that is you are not levelling up your character but the game is levelling you up with each boss encounter which feel amazing. Sounds ridiculous but as I keep moving forward, it's just getting better and better. All the parry mechanic like normal parry, mikiri counter, etc is just a small example how the game successfully make you feel badass when you manage to execute it perfectly. Lack of customization? No big deal, I've never been a big fan of dark souls and bloodborne because of that as with Sekiro, the point is you just need to getting better learn every enemy attack pattern, sharpen your reflect and observation skills and I believe even you die a lot, you just keep coming back and said ""Ok, i got it! I'll beat this monster this time"" I'm on my 2nd play-through now and you'll just realize the fact that I just mentioned ""The game is levelling you up"" as I've reached and beaten Owl Ashina in only 3 hours of playing the game which it took me around 20 hours to reach him on my 1st play through and it's still took me around 20-30 tries but now it just took me 2 tries to beat him. CONCLUSION: Worth to try if you start to feel all games nowadays just focus on looking graphically stunning and make you feel overpower. This game is completely different and you'll not regret it (you might at the first few hours but just keep pushing and you'll know it) TIPS: Don't be afraid of dying, dying is part of the game as you might die to learn all the enemy tricks and attack pattern. It's common thing so don't dodge or running away, instead just keep on playing defense and learn all the attack patterns. 2. Don't hesitate when you feel you can attack but don't rush or greedy, keep looking at the enemy attack motion as they tend to look slow but it's a complete trap",10,2021-08-16,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Smallchungus167,"Sekiro adds the posture system and making the constant attacking and pinpoint deflecting a must in every encounter - steel clashes on steel in a rhythmic, mesmerizing, and almost hypnotic manner. Another crucial element that makes this game such an enthralling experience to play is the inclusion of perilous attacks. When the enemy flashes a red kanji symbol, you have a second to determine what they're doing and how you're supposed to react accordingly: will they thrust you? Step on their weapon the moment it launches. Will they perform a sweep? Jump over the sweep and counter them with an overhead attack. Will they attempt to grab you? Dodge towards their back to give yourself a big opening. This system feels daunting at first, but I guarantee it will click with you at some point in the game, and it will feel fantastic to counter perilous attacks, something no other video game has ever done yet.",10,2021-08-07,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Skouyter21,"This is one of the best games I've played in a while. Yes it's difficult to play but the feeling of reward I got from beating bosses who I've been battling for hours(sometimes days) is so satisfying. You have to literally go into this game with the mindset of a professional boxer. There is going to be a lot of rounds to fight(expect to die a LOT)and you'll need to get good at studying your opponents, looking for weaknesses, and exploiting those weaknesses in a careful and timely manner. This game is chess not checkers. You also have to be a glutton for punishment in playing this as well. This isn't one of those games that will ask you if you want to decrease the difficulty because you keep getting manhandled by a boss or mini boss. You died? Too bad. Go back and try again. This game is THAT much of a savage. Those who gave this a 1 star review either thought it would be like something else entirely or just aren't built to tackle a truly challenging game experience.

Knindish46,Amazing game one of my favorites. Combat it beautiful and simple yet never gets tired. Prosthetics are an amazing tool and it seems like every enemy and boss has a specific counter. There are multiple skill trees and each ability you get changes your character a significant amount. Each skill changes the way you play or approach a fight. The environments in the world are amazing and really immerse you in the fantasy world. The enemy variety is very diverse and there are tons of unique enemies and the same applies to bosses. The game is very hard and there is no way to change it. But you can cheese a number of bosses if you want the game to be a little easier and I chose to do that with a couple.,10,2021-08-05,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The atmosphere, sounds, music instills such a sense of connection with the protagonist that he is easily my favourite character. And the sense of reward and achievement is unparalled.

Makejames188,"This game has Tenchu lineage in it's blood and that's a good thing. The combat, while a very challenging and fluid affair is not the only means to take out the enemies presented to you in this huge yet dense action adventure/stealth game. THIS IS NOT DARK SOULS. Just because you have played that series or Bloodborne doesn't not mean the same mechanics and principles apply. This is a stealth action game where running away and finding ambush and vantage point to whittle down the enemies numbers rewards you more than swinging your sword till things die. This game rewards patience alot more than brazen fighting ability. As a lover of the stealth genre it's painful tio watch players stand on the top of a building with a huge vantage point that allows you to scope out the area and plan you attack just jump into the middle of four to five enemies yelling that the game is too hard. There's more than one way to play this game. I'd definitely recommend it to stealth action players and fans , not to casual Souls fans.",10,2021-08-05,PLAYSTATION 4,user

oonabe,"This is the worst ninja/samurai game I've ever played, and yes, I know Sekiro is a shinobi but I put it on that more general genre so I can compare to a wider range of games that have similar settings and contents as this. Sekiro is a game that many people seem to think is hard and many players are proud to beat and speak about it with a big mouth, if there is a term likes souls veteran it's exactly because of that, they think souls games are hard and if they come back alive from that experience it's comparable to a war veteran or something. Well, let me tell you something, these games are not hard at all, their difficulty is mostly faked and the way to beat them often very very simplistic, which is why the games get so popular at the end, because there isn't really much to them, it doesn't really need skills or intelligence to beat any FromSoftware game, it only needs a little bit of patience to find out how they work and when you find out they're a piece of cake. With Sekiro this formula has been taken to the max, the game is not hard at all, it's only inflexible, it only lets you beat it by using a very limited range of moves, but if you have a little patience and learn those (I'm talking about basically four moves, it isn't that much) you can beat the game easily and you can see what a piece of crap and lazy work this game actually is. The game lives from a couple of ohs and ahs moments like some big snake boss or a moneky that keeps fighting after being beheaded and of course also of horde of vehement fans of this company who would buy anything as long as they see the FromSoftware logo on it, if you don't believe go see what they are doing with upcoming Elden Ring, all of them wetting their pants everytime someone sneezes and it sounds similar to the words elden ring, it's just like Justin Bieber hysterical fans at this point. The thing is that this game is so simple that it becomes boring after a couple of boss fights because anyone with a brain can see that no matter the boss design, if it's a samurai on a horse or an old lady or big snake... at the end you always do the same three moves and every fight feels the same. The story is crap, I've seen a lot of FS fans criticizing the story of other games when they're no different from Sekiro's then they don't do the same with this one or even say Sekiro's story is good. Also the NPC's AI is one of the dumbest I've seen since the 90s, just try throwing a shuriken to some enemy who's aware of you, you will see one single animation that you could looping forever if you had endless shuriken - lazy work, as I said. The difficulty is completely faked, most of it is hidden behind a terible input lag (if you compare this game's speed and responsiveness to most japanese games it feels like a bad joke, like someone telling you you have to run very fast and at the same time puts heavy weights on your shoes) and also the long animations. From the moment you push the button to hit with your sword to the moment your sword actually hits there is often a long animation that gives the NPC enough time for an input read and react to what you have pushed without being noticed, unless you have a brain of course, then you only need to use your logic to find out this game is no hard, it's only cheating you in a very cheap way. And the proof of it is the existence of an ""invisible help"" in the game, which as the name says it's not visible, there is nothing like a ghost helping you in battle, it is only that they give you a little bit more of random values in your favor when tricking you in such a blatant way. This game is pure crap and many people might say then why was it game oif the year 2019? Well, did you remember Activision put some money on it? Again, use your logic and don't be fooled by gaming companies like these. Sekiro is the worst game in this genre and anyone with a little bit of intelligence and analytical thinking can see it, don't let vehement fanboys tell you what you have to like or dislike, even when that seems to be the trend in the internet era. Don't even listen at me with this critic play the game but be critical to what you see and be honest to yourself when talking about it, that's what I'm doing here if you like what you hear or not.

gutterra,"In this game, you will be fighting bosses for most of the time - I've reached the final boss by the way. So, what about the combat? Well, you are pretty much glued face to face with your opponent for 80% of the time. Sekiro is a fighting game (with some light stealth segments). There are two genres of games I don't like and never have: sport games and fighting games. Also, there is zero weapon variety which makes the combat even more lackluster. What a pity. Oh well, I'm sure FROM will be back with a great action RPG after this little misstep. On the positive side, the atmosphere is superb and almost have the same qualities as Dark souls and Bloodborne.",7,2021-07-17,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Tenarus,"I am just dissappointed by the game FromSoft delivered here. The voiceacting and graphics are good. But thats really it. The game is full of severe (!) bugs, the movement is very inprecise, buggy and laggy - you can clearly note, that FromSoft used the same engine Ds3 ran on and this engine isn't really suited for Sekiro. I would go that far to state: The movement is in points of bugs, missing physics and in general its ""wonkyness"" the worst I have seen in any game up to this date (and this includes Skyrim!). The balancing is ok (you expect hard enemies from a soulslike game). Most of the enemies are repeats along the way. Enemy-design does not get interesting in the slightest. The bosses are bland as well and not challenging at all. ""Challenge"" only comes from the quantity of enemies, never from quality. Putting enemies right next to savepoints is just a bad decision design-wise; developers should know better and not make this mistake. I pushed myself to do the platinum, hoping the game would get fun at some point. In the end this time was wasted. Sekiro wasnt fun in the beginning and it still wasnt when I was done with the platinum trophy. 2 points for voiceacting and graphics, 1 for new ideas (the arm with integrated hook, ...). But sadly 0 points for controlls, enemy-design and gameplay in general. Edit: I've given the game another shot once again and need to revise my scoring. If the only challenge within a game comes from its badly made controls, I cant give any points for ideas and graphics. Challenge compared to other souls-likes 1/10, execution of controlls 0/10. Overall funfactor of the game 0/10 as well.",0,2021-07-06,PLAYSTATION 4,user
ADEGaming,"Sekiro, well well well. This is my first soulslike game. But hot damn, now I see the reason for the hype. I am now writing this review after I played my first DSR playthrough. They are completely different but share a lot of similarities. Is sekiro really much more difficult than Dark souls? Yes. How? Sekiro is completely a single-player experience. You will not receive any help from the community. Now, if you found a roadblock in Sekiro, this is the kind of game that requires you to use some of your braincells in order to be adaptive and learn from the mistakes of your defeat. The combat is far more superior than Darksouls, the world and aesthetics of Sekiro trumps Darksouls. However, the exploration aspect of Darksouls is far more satisfying. Anyway, Darksouls and Sekiro introduced me to this new genre of games. I hope Elden Ring will be able to deliver.",10,2021-07-05,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Jahuui6148,"Having played all dark souls games as well as Bloodborne I thought I was well prepared for Sekiro. I soon realized i was not. A lot of the mechanics seem similar yet so different. The combat system is stunning. As I never used shields in any souls game, always just grabbing the biggest weapon I could get my hands on I had a hard time getting used to deflecting. Majority of combat is deflecting attacks and boy it is satisfying to get a streak of perfect deflects. Most boss fights are so incredible that I did not mind at all getting my ass smacked over and over. Especially Owl (father), I died to him at least a dozen times yet I enjoyed every single fight. Most bosses have unique movesets and are very challenging yet beatable. Story is very engaging and despite wanting to go for the Shura ending I chose the Purification mostly because of the want to be the ""good guy"". Character dialogues hide a lot of secrets and similarly as in other FromSoft games most of the story is hidden. Most characters, including mini-bosses, have an interesting backstory worth exploring through eavesdrops, item collection and easter eggs. Death is arguably more punishing than in souls. Upon death Sekiro loses half his Sen (money) and a lot of experience. Neither is anyhow possible to regain other than gaining new. The skill system is very intricate however I found only a select few of the skills to be useful. On the other hand the prosthetic tool upgrades were one of my favourite features, however difficult it is to fully upgrade all of the **** best part about Sekiro are the bosses. Never being a fan of big bosses I was very sceptical of the Guardian Ape. I was pleasantly surprised how well done the boss is and I enjoyed it as much as all the swordfights, which are absolutely spectacular. The only bossfights I did not like were the Divine Dragon and The Folding Monkeys. Other that those two, all bosses are a masterpiece.",10,2021-06-30,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Jamie2683,"After doing the game 100% and unlocking every single achievement, i feel like i can finally make a review of it. I will list my pros and cons and then make a small comentary about it: Pros: + Game is very polished, and i did not feel like i was getting BS killed as it happened sometimes with the Dark Souls games. + Combat is more dynamic than any of the Dark Souls, and also more than bloodborne. + It has a story you can follow without reading 400 item descriptions. + ""Bonfires"" at bosses door makes it far more entertaining, as it allows you to fight them full HP and items, so you can play more agro, and it's also a LOT less infuriating when you die. + Graphics are really beautiful. I wish i had a monitor over 1080p to play this. + Defeating some bosses for the first time feels like a real achievement, not crappy ""ez mechanics"" like Storm Ruler on DS3. + Customizable controls! +Had way less "" it im leaving it here"" with this game than with any other fromsoftware title. Cons: - Once you get the parry system, it's more of a walk than anything else to be honest.Combining NG+ and NG++ i only died to bosses 3 times, doing the two longest endings, and one of them was because i ran out of battery on my controller. - It only took me 42 hours to unlock every single achievement and complete 4 runs (from ng to ng+++). - Although you have a lot of prosthetic tools and upgrades, and habilities at your disposal, if you learn to parry almost every single one of them is rendered useless.",10,2021-06-30,PLAYSTATION 4,user

5Naelok,"Playing Sekiro is this bizarre dance between feeling utterly helpless and completely invulnerable. You first encounter a boss and the mops the floor with you. You struggle to stay ahead of his attacks, guzzling potions and cursing as you barely manage to shave off even 25% of a health bar in there before dying. You get smashed down and murdered by the **** again and again. Then it clicks, and you've got it. You know to jump right after the fury attack, back up and then counter when he raises his blade over his left shoulder and that he's wide open if you get behind him after the sword combo. All of a sudden you're blowing through the boss' first form (or maybe two) without taking a hit. I like that feeling. It's damn hard, but I'm not getting better at fights because I leveled up my sword power, I am getting better because I have mastered these immensely complicated patterns and am weaving between them to attain victory.

Uglzorp579,"Sekiro is what happens when you mix Tenchu with Dark Souls. You can sneak and backstab your way through most of the game but when it comes to bosses, you'll have to fight. As someone who was frustrated by certain elements of Dark Souls, I found Sekiro to be far more enjoyable. The biggest improvement is the shrine system (equivalent to the bonfires in DS). Unlike the bonfires in DS, shrines are always placed next to bosses. This greatly reduces the amount of backtracking you have to do whenever you get killed (which will happen a lot). In addition, using a shrine doesn't automatically respawn enemies unless you rest or fast travel. Finally, shrines are far more plentiful than bonfires were in DS. Throw in your grappling hook and rapid move speed and you'll never take long to get where you want to go. The bonfire system in DS always felt like it was designed to waste my time and the shrine system in Sekiro is a huge improvement.",10,2021-06-27,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Britannia11,"This game taught me the very hard way to fight masterly with the katana. Like in real life the katana here is more than just a sword; is has a soul of its own. You have to be one with it, if you want to master this game. In contrast to any Souls or Souls-like game the victory over an oppenent isn't the most rewarding, in Sekiro it is sword combat itself which has one of the best fighting systems I have ever known in a game so far. Thus, the combats against every minor or big boss are an extraordinary immersive and intensive experience. Like in a real sword duel everything ‚Äì or in other words your victory or death - depends on whether you can ‚Äûread‚Äú the movements of your opponents or not; furthermore, if you can handle your katana the perfectly right way, especially to block and parry all of your opponent's attacks in the very right moment. And if you do so, you can decide the duel in your favour in a very brief moment, so that you kill your enemy and will be victorious ‚Ä¶ or you will be dead also in just a few seconds ;). Overall a great game from From Software, which has some similarities to their previous games (Dark Souls 1-3, Bloodborne), but in its way and style it is very unique and outstanding, especially because of its exceptional duels, which will make you tensed up and sweat like in no other game before. Yes, it is quite difficult, but everyone can handle it, who has the patience and passion to try a difficult and severe situation or boss fight over and over again - even if there will be only little progress at times - and is willing to learn from his/her own mistakes.",10,2021-06-27,PLAYSTATION 4,user
TitanOfRage5,"When I heard that Sekiro wasn't going to have character customization, weapon pick ups, armor pickups, and many other features that were in other Dark Souls games. I thought the game was going to be absolutely terrible. after playing it every day for the past few days I can honestly say that I enjoy the game. ya its lacking in those features but what it lacks, it makes up for in story, combat features, and a depth of free movement that makes you feel like a stealthy badass. The game is absolutely breathtaking in its visuals and it amps up what made the Dark Souls franchise so infamous, it takes Dark Souls difficulty pisses on it and ramps it up a notch. You trembled at sister friede well wait for what the Butterfly lady has in store for you! Dark Souls always gave you a difficult first boss to rumble with before you entered the world of bend over and take it.

PA1ker56,Such a great game and so satisfying. Unlearn the dodge/roll technique from Dark Souls/Bloodborne cause it won't help you here as this game requires mainly patience and a lot of deflecting skills. Combat is fluid and bosses are difficult but not impossible. Keep at it and it does get easier as you learn the enemy's moves and learn to utilize your tools properly. Exploration is fun and there are many ways to play the game as you aren't forced into one linear path so you can go off and do side bosses before the main bosses if you wish.

Dr_Unk,"This was the first game from ""From Software"" that I played and HOLY **** that was hard! I would play the game, get frustrated because of the difficulty, and quit. Then every time I turned on my PS4, I felt as if the game was taunting me. So, I ended getting ""GUD"" and was able to beat the game. Despite the difficulty, This is still a great game! Very creative gameplay as well as some very creative boss fights that keep you on your toes. A couple of things I didn't care for was the plot being very dialogue-heavy and the dragonrot. Every time you talked to one of the main NPC's, I felt like it would go on forever, and it got boring real quick. And as for the dragonrot portion, I understand why it's there but I think it could have been done better.

I played a lot of games and I can easily say that this game offers the best combat/fight system to date. It's extremely rewarding and makes you feel like a total badass. Your prosthetic arm gives you a a lot of addition tactics in battle due to the collection of gadgets you can attach to it. Also you can learn unique combos, strikes and skills. So yeah like I said pretty awesome gamplay wise. The story is nothing too spectacular but keeps you motivated. Every region has some sort of verticality for your movement with the grappling hook. Stealth makes many parts a lot easier. I think Dark Souls 1 and Bloodborne have still better regions and atmosphere but thats my opinion. I'd say this game is not as hard as Dark Souls 1 or Bloodborne due to the fact it's way fairer and stealth makes -like I said- almost every part easier except for the bosses ofc .. In addition you almost never die because of some BS. Ye it has a steep learning curve but it's very rewarding. After Bloodborne my favorite Soulsborne like game.

KxngMikk1888,"Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, A 16th century supernatural ARPG from the legendary studio FromSoftware and mastermind Hidetaka Miyazaki, the man that gave us the phenomenal Bloodborne and Dark Souls franchise. Sekiro is based in a fictional version of 16 Century Japan where you play a Shinobi called Sekiro meaning One-Armed Wolf. The game starts with an opening cinematic about the conflict in Ashina coming to an end, You see Sekiro as a child, as a man (Owl) walks up to him and asks the ""Starving Wolf"" to join him, He trains the child ""relentlessly"" to become a master Shinobi. You start the game of in a cell pit as someone throws down the clue to your escape, this first chapter is sort of a way to help you get a feel for the game and it's controls, if your used to the typical Dark Souls gameplay you're going to have to adjust your playstyle as Sekiro is all about posture, at the bottom of the screen your posture is displayed and at the top your enemies, you have to deflect to build up posture, blocking works but not as well, you have a very small time frame to deflect so your reflexes have to be on point as that could lead to death. In previous FromSoftware games dying was the worst thing that could happening, in Sekiro they took a different approach as you can resurrect once after each death, some enemies have this as well, above their health there is a red indicator so you know how many times they can resurrect.",10,2021-06-22,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Sentienl1720,"+ It has the open ended level design of Dark Souls 1, with you being able to take out bosses in the order you want via map branching at a certain point. + The combat is very good. It's the first combat system I've seen that manages to pull off fast swordfighting convincingly while not being a clunky mess or guess work. Some moves are very satisfying to pull off, like Lightning Reversal or Mid-air Deathblows, and the sound effects of deflecting just makes it all more satisfying. + The story has the most branching of any FromSoft game yet (which isn't a lot, admittedly), with some bosses being exclusive to certain choices, and one of them is the first time FromSoft has done something of the sort. + Resource scarcity is done very well, making the consumables you pick up through exploration and mini-boss killing extremely valuable. + All the encounters are designed to encourage players to use consumables instead of just hoarding them. + The big majority of the tools are good or great. + There isn't a single area that makes me think ""I don't wanna go through this annoying again"", unlike all the past FromSoft games. + Final boss forces you to use everything you've learned throughout the game while not feeling unfair. + Trademark Miyazaki-led enemy placement and usage. Unlike Dark Souls 2 and Dark Souls 3's DLC, which had Tanimura's handiwork, this game doesn't bombard you with extremely annoying waves of enemies in closed spaces that you have to bruteforce your way through with no other options or trick to the encounters. - Emblem system is annoying. I honestly wish it'd just replenish when you rested/communed at an idol and didn't require buying them. There are some times where you're banging your head against a boss encounter but you run out of emblems and gold to buy them. The system as-is does not really encourage experimentation a lot. - Most of the soundtrack is trash - which doesn't surprise me considering Yuka Kitamura composed most of it. There are a couple songs that I liked and got me in the mood, but I noticed there was a 2nd composer, and I'm willing to bet they had his hand, just like Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3. - One particular optional boss fight is terrible and ignores 90% of the combat mechanics in the game, which leaves a very bad taste in your mouth. It's a Bloodborne boss in Sekiro. It just doesn't work. - Hitboxes on grabs are (still) totally, now a problem exacerbated by the reduced iframes. Both beast bosses use these fairly often, and if a death results from a bad hitbox it can be pretty triggering. Excellent game.",10,2021-06-22,PLAYSTATION 4,user

BalliSti0X,"Sekiro is a great game that is quiet challenging even if you have beaten the souls series multiple times. The combat is very fast paced and with ""posture"" being a major player with in the system it takes some getting used to coming from two handed great swords. Parrying is another major part of the combat system and you probably wont get very far without it. Each enemy give experience points that can be used to unlock skills. Unlocking skills does make things like sneaking around and using ""Sugars"" and other items to last longer but you can certainly get through the game without spending them. I didn't use the ""special move"" skills much as they took along time to come out and i didn't find the pay off to be worth the risk. You can scroll through your inventory during combat as time is paused which is different to Dark Souls. This makes it so that you can find the item you want and use it without having to run away, scroll through your hot bar and make enough distance so you can use the item all at the same time. All in all, I think Sekiro was fun to play and very satisfying to complete but I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would.

MultiSapman37,"This game is difficult if you are used to playing Dark Souls-ish games as it makes you unlearn a lot of the mechanics from those games. Instead of block/rolling/continuous evasion, this game forces you to go head-on and clash the glorious nippon steel with your foes at full throttle. If you keep your block up, prepare to get punished after getting posture broken. The trick is to learn the enemies attack patterns and deflect his attacks by just blocking the instant his/her damage is about to hit you. All the other while, you need to be aggressive and target their posture meter down to get deathblows. If you consider enemies having just 2 resource bars (health and posture in sekiro instead of health and stamina from souls games), then focusing on posture breaks is what works in Sekiro.

Mobbat5000,"Having played every FromSoftware game, Sekiro is the only one to emphasize the players growth in skill, and mastery of combat. Every boss in the game is not only an obstacle, but a learning opportunity that tests the player to see if they have mastered the skills they have learned and obtained thus far. By the end of the game, the player is faced with an all too familiar challenge that makes the players growth in their first playthrough all the more apparent and rewarding. There is still much to do after the first playthrough, since the game features 4 unique endings, and optional difficulty increases if players wish to further master the game.",10,2021-06-21,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Frozorid19,"I hate Dark Souls. Its particular strain of sadomasochism-passing-for-gameplay has infected so many genres that all it takes for a game with clunky movement and a terrible camera to earn the adulation of credulous imbeciles (recognizable by their rallying cry ""git gud"") is to call itself ""a Souls-like"". Fortunately, Sekiro is not Dark Souls. Yes, the cameraman still attempts to perform an amateur colonoscopy whenever a large enemy backs you into a corner. And yes, even petty bandits (or frail old ladies) can combo you to death off of one mistake. However, the main difference between this game and the entirety of the Dark Souls canon is that combat is actually fun. Fluid movement, a stamina mechanic that rewards aggression, and excellent visual/sound design all make even standard enemies encounters enjoyable. The implementation of a rudimentary (yet serviceable) stealth system means that working your way back to bosses after you die never becomes unmanageably tedious. The bosses themselves are difficult but not unreasonably so (at least during the first playthrough), and while they can all be defeated ""fairly"", Sekiro provides enough tools to mercilessly cheese most of them if the player is willing to experiment. While I do have a variety of criticisms ranging from the quality of the story (""minimalist"" would be putting it generously) to the limited enemy variety (you fight 4 versions of the same miniboss) to consumable scarcity (certain enemies become very annoying or even borderline impossible to defeat without items you cannot obtain easily until late in the game), none of these are serious enough to deny my enthusiastic recommendation.",10,2021-06-19,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Desintegrador75,"I was really hesitant to buy this game. A lot of people said it was harder than DS and I was never good at any of the Souls games, even though I have played them all (except Demon Souls) and beat them. Dark Souls was one of my favorite games, despite all its flaws, frame rate drops, budget cuts and brutal difficulty. For the most part, though, I didn't like it for its difficulty, I liked it for the world it built. Sekiro is definitely more about combat, and (slightly) less about exploration, but combat is much tighter and exciting, and less frustrating. In the end, I found the game very fair, definitely exciting, and hard but certainly not impossible.",10,2021-06-19,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Nozoeok8,"Fast-paced, visceral, and far more realistic than previous souls games. Combat consists of breaking an enemy's posture, which means attacking them, deflecting their attacks, and other special actions. This is the big win of this game. Fighting is about rhythm. Since enemies always have the same move combos, you can detect the rhythm of their attacks while blocking, and the next time you see this, just repeat that rhythm with your deflect button. This would become boring after a while, but the perilous attacks add a little spice to the equation.

The stealth elements of Sekiro allow you to get into many positions for silent assassinations or simply explore the varied environments.

I enjoyed my fair share of Souls games so far, since I fell in love with the series right from the awkwardly silent release of Demon's Souls ‚Äì and yet From Software continues to surprise me again and again. At heart Sekiro plays more like an unique mix of Soulsborne & Dishonored, with obvious parallels to the Tenchu series, yet combat is so ridiculously focused. Every single encounter is designed with rhythm and personality in mind ‚Äì once you learn a bosses pattern, you'll be able to dominate him on every following playthrough.

I only got it because one of my best friends kept recommending it to me, and although I had heard that it was hard, I had no idea how brutal it actually was. Still, I kept at it, and the moment the combat clicked, I instantly saw it in an entirely new light. The combat is fast-paced and exhilarating, and every death is just another lesson. In order to build you up into a Shinobi killing machine, Sekiro first has to break you down repeatedly. And the game scales the difficulty as you go, making sure that there's always a new challenge to throw yourself at. The graphics are absolutely beautiful, and the story is also rich and compelling. Sekrio: Shadows Die Twice is a masterpiece worthy of recognition, and anyone who is up to the challenge should play it.",10,2021-06-16,PLAYSTATION 4,user
TechForcer485,Sekiro is like Guardians of the Galaxy. You have to dance to defeat your enemies. If you dance better than your enemy then you will win. On more serious note here are things I like about this game. Pros - Better than Dark Souls (I played every Dark Souls game) - Harder than Dark Souls. This game is more about timing your attacks. - Best sword combat I have ever seen in a game - Atmospheric. They nailed the feudal Japan feel. - Nice soundtrack - Highly replayable. There are 4 endings. Some endings will make you fight new bosses. - Great boss fights - Very polished and optimized Cons - You are not dancing right if you think there is any. 11/10 Would dance again.,10,2021-06-16,PLAYSTATION 4,user

This game makes you feel like the ultimate beast when everything clicks, I can play over and over again and never get bored,I've beat it like 50-60 times already, did several speedruns, challange runs, boss rushes, beating the game without dying, FromSoftware is truly the GOAT developers, can't wait to see what they do with Elden Ring.",10,2021-06-16,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Austicsaviant69,"+ The art-style fits the Sengoku Japan setting of the game pretty well. + Similar to From's previous games, there are checkpoints you have to search for. + Combat is pretty fun once you understand how it works.

This boss is ) + Multiple endings. + Stealth in this game is fun as opposed to the boring stuff you see in other games. + Fun boss fights. + The game rewards you for exploration. + Japanese voice acting in this game is top-notch. + Lots of varied areas and enemies. You will fight humans, monkeys, monsters and more monkeys. Lots and lots of monkeys. +- The game is very fast-paced. This is alright once you get used to it but might feel too hard while playing the game for the first few hours. +- Some soundtracks were fun to listen to. Some were ""ok"". - While I like challenging games, this game felt too punishing. Getting hit two to four times while fighting bosses means you are dead. Moreover, some attacks are fast and will one-shot you which is something I haven't encountered in From's previous games. One-shots have always been clearly telegraphed in their previous games (remember Lorian's beam in DS3?) but for some reason they did not follow the same rule in this game. - It can take a long time trying to beat some bosses/mini bosses only for you to get killed for getting hit twice.

GRRicky,"I would not say this is better than bloodborne, which is still my favourite PS4game, but I can see why some may think this is the best FromSoft game. The core premise of this game is you, as the player, become better and better. Remember the chilling moment you had when defeating a difficult boss? The rewarding moment in sekiro comes much later; it comes in new game plus. In the multiple playthroughs, you as a player can fully experience how much better you become compares to the first playthrough and how fair (or in fair) the bosses are. For me, that many bosses like the guardian ape and sword saint are so fairly designed that once you really learnt them, you will never struggle against them again. And this feeling of power is so different from other souls games where players over levelling their character or using some insane built, which can sometimes create a sense of emptiness by providing a fake feeling of accomplishment.",9,2021-06-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Delta98,"Having just got the final achievement at NG+4 I have to say it is one of the best games I have played. Being the huge Soulsborne fan I am this was a really refreshing take to the already polished From Software **** game takes place during the Sengoku era of Japanese history in the land of Ashina. You play as shinobi Wolf tied up in a battle over the powers of immortality whilst seeking revenge on the samurai clan who attacked you and kidnapped your lord. In comparison to previous From Software titles, the gameplay is very fast paced with a much higher focus on skill rather than stats. The game strips you of your ability to customize stats, choose between weapons and vary your build and instead creates a much more focused and well polished experience where all elements of gameplay feel much more thought out and planned; the game does not suffer the issue of ""too many weapons"" and instead allows you to vary your play only a bit in terms of combat arts. It is not for everyone. It is a very difficult beast to master and takes a lot of patience and practice. However this all pays off as the experience becomes much more rewarding when you finally master that boss you have been stuck at for hours and instead of just beating him with great stats or luck, you realize that you have learned the boss and become better at the game. This invokes a true feeling of progression and reward that just leveling cannot give. To conclude, the game is not for everyone. If you are looking for a challenging but fair experience that actually takes effort and skill to beat and not just tedious grinding, this might be the game for you. For fans of the Soulsborne series I highly recommend the game, however know that your previous experience will work against you in the start; you will have to re-adapt to this new and amazing experience.",10,2021-06-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Lexnextdex21,"One of the best games i've played so far. As a fan of soulsborne series i must say i love this game! It's without a doubt both easier and harder in different aspects than the previous souls games. The general enemies are easier than they have ever been because you can stealth kill everybody in the level if you choose to but then the mini bosses and actual bosses come along... They aren't the most difficult bosses but they are very challenging and there are very few options to power up and brute force your way through a boss. You can farm xp and money to buy new skills and other things but you can't raise your base stats. If you aren't sure of yourself or willing to improve you could hit a brick wall after a few hours and give up. Combat is very responsive and nearly all the problems like phantom hits, delayed actions after button presses, and unresponsive controls from the souls series have been fixed. On my 1650 at 1080p I get a solid 60fps on a mixture of max and high settings so the game runs well also much better than previous Fromsoft **** soundtrack beautifully complimented each area and encounter. It's one of the most impactful and memorable scores from their library I have played. I'm an explorer and love finding secrets. Trust me, there are tons of those as you progress and you're rewarded for going off the beaten path. So the game will most likely satisfy you about that. I also don't recommend using any guides on your first playthrough and experiencing everything first hand. Try not to get too angry when you sit back and enjoy ancient castles, bamboo forests, acid swamps, mountain side temples, forsaken villages, and more in this journey you're about to take.

You will die. A lot. Way more than twice. Just..a lot. This is not a Soulsborne game. You are not some powerful knight capable of face-tanking every entity you come across. You are a ninja. The game will remind you constantly of this fact. You are free to play as dirty as you know the enemies will. Poison them, set them on fire, stab them in the butt when they are not looking and then Spider-Man away. Who cares! Just kill them before they kill you. If there is anything to take away from my rambling, it is simply this. You are shinobi. You are not a samurai or knight. So don't expect to play as one and you and this game will get along well!

Flound4er,"Playing through Sekiro for the first time was the greatest gaming experience of my life. Never has a game meant so much to me. Like all the Souls, this game is pure immersion--It speaks to you in every detail. And the difficulty drives you deep into the this immersive experience, where you find yourself gritting your teeth, riveted to the screen and fighting with all your might to just stay in it a little longer. To deflect and to dodge and to land just one more hit! Time and again, Sekiro had me falling out of my chair, stunned with the realization of what I must do... Twice! The resurrection mechanic just further enriches the experience, forcing you to become the ultimate shinobi master and and not only beat a boss, but completely to annihilate it... or at the very least to just barely out-live it, surviving and succeeding by the tiniest of margins. What a game! As a Souls fan (both dark souls and various other souls-like games), this game is just a treasure. It excels in areas Dark Souls cannot. Being provided with only one main weapon means makes for a finely tuned PVE combat experience that is much more immersive than the other Souls games... and you don't have any choice about it! You are forced to master these new mechanics, and quickly find yourself grappling around, sprinting, dodging, deflecting, and then destroying enemies and bosses that will leave your breathless with their magnificence. I could say more, but I don't want to spoil it for anyone. I implore you to not watch any videos of anyone else playing this game. No streams, no youtube, no reading about it. Just play the game. You just stumbled upon the greatest 1-player game of all time. Immerse yourself in it. Enjoy the experience.",10,2021-06-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Razee1,"Sekiro is not a Souls game. This can't be stressed enough. Attempt to i-frame dodge through the game and you will get your ass slapped all the way back to Lordran. While it borrows certain elements from Souls, like the checkpoint system or cryptic NPC questlines, it's pretty much its own beast. And what a beast it is. It's one of those good news, bad news situations. Good news: the days when you needed to keep an eye on your stamina for every attack, block or dodge are over. Bad news: that doesn't mean the game is any less challenging. Quite the opposite, actually. Wolfie goes down in two hits tops, and at all times he's either heavily outnumbered or he gets crushed in the health bar measuring contest. And the absence of stats, gear and online co-op means there are no shortcuts. You won't be able to overlevel, no Solaire will come to your aid. It's either nut up or shut up. Luckily, there are ways to put you at a lesser disadvantage. Sekiro features a rudimentary stealth system and enough freedom to thin out your enemies' ranks one by one. Most of the times you can clear entire areas just by being sneaky. Apparently, Sekiro started out as a Tenchu game and I totally believe it, considering how far stealth will get you. But eventually a direct confrontation will be unavoidable. And where Souls games required you to only land that one parry, Sekiro demands that you time your blocks near perfectly several times per exchange. Combat is fast, fluid and demanding enough to make you break a sweat. While the areas are open and generally well-designed, they are not exactly eyecandy. Souls games are known for their sinister beauty, but that is largely absent in Sekiro. Some areas look flat-out rough. Only rarely will you get the urge to stop and soak in the atmosphere. A missed opportunity, really. And while the environments leave room for exploration, the absence of cool gear makes it feel strangely unrewarding. Also, due to the nature of combat you will see the same instakill moves and finishers quite often. A bit of variety would have been nice. Like the player, Sekiro faces its own set of challenges. Developer From Software has been around for over three decades, but only since the release of Demon's Souls the studio has gained a larger recognition in the West. Ever since, most of their games have been Souls games either directly or in spirit. Being widely known as the developer of Souls games came with the issue that they were expected to make nothing but Souls games - a curse, if you will. Sekiro marks the first time in a while that a major From Software title branches out far enough to be called its own thing - and be accepted by a large audience. With that leap of faith out of the way, it'll be exciting to see what they will come up with next.",10,2021-06-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Ukrainec2014,"Sekiro: Shadow Die Twice is one of the worst games I've played. It's so bad it's hard to describe in words. A scanty amount of tricks, no combo attacks, normal dodge and block, crooked camera and physics, terrible game design and incredible unreasonable complexity. I love the Ninja Gaiden series. I also love all hack and slash games, and games with a Japanese flavor. It would seem that I should have liked this game, but this is a terrible shame and a slap in the face for all slasher players. The only thing that should be noted in the game is good graphics and design. Otherwise, this is one of the main disgraces of 2019. In the game, we have only one attack, the same type of katana strike. After hitting the enemy several times, you can finish it off with the same button. AI of enemies is just as bad. If they spot you, they won't leave again until they finish you off. The game is supposedly a stealth action game, but this is unacceptable for this genre. The location design is not intuitive and there are no clues about where to go. There is no location map or visual directions in the game itself. If you want to see some really cool Japanese action game, play Ninja Gaiden, Metal Gear Rising Revengeance, or Killer Is Dead. These games are many times better than the unfairly hyped Sekiro.",1,2021-05-19,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Despresso9,"Sekiro is the type of game that pushes you to your limits, you hate it, but then you realize you've been falling in love with it. It's one of the greatest experiences gaming has to offer, overcoming the impossible, not because of an XP system or leveling up, but because you grew up as a shinobi, your skills got better, you started getting the hang of the game, you became the shinobi. + Awesome OST + Top tier gameplay + Shinobi boy + Difficult + Japanese lore, and setting, LOVE IT! + Long, but not long enough to fill the void that IT will create :( - The monk is using hax I swear - You won't find a game quite like it, so the hollow feeling will last.

Evisicrator13,"After finally beating Sekiro I only feel one emotion, satisfaction. Satisfaction that I pushed through the odds and got ""gud."" This game isn't like a Souls game, in fact its nothing like it. If people say Dark Souls is hard, then Sekiro is unbeatable. After beating Sekiro it really put into perspective how ""easy"" the souls games are. People take for granted how many tools and assist's you get throughout the souls games, magic for being able to cheese bosses, buffs to speed up kills, leveling stats to close the gap, summoning help from other players. All of these tools to help you beat any obstacle thrown at you and people still call those games hard, I was one of them, but after beating Sekiro that has all changed. Sekiro rips away all of those tools to help you succeed and leaves you with only one thing, raw skill. The only way to beat Sekiro is to familiarize yourself with the mechanics and master them. No summons to help you fight the boss, no magic to cheese from far away, just your raw skill and determination. This game will push you to the limit, it will break you over and over again until you either push past your limits, or crumble from defeat. This game will make you relearn all over again how to play, in all honesty you'd be better off playing this game before any other souls games. If you're like me and so many others that have put hundreds of hours into the souls series then you will have an especially hard time with this game. All of those hours perfecting the mechanics and getting in the play-style of playing defensively, staying back and waiting will completely and utterly ruin you with this game. This game will force you to forget all of your previous knowledge and relearn everything. If you don't master the art of deflecting, counterattacking, and taking advantage of enemies you will not be able to finish this game. But once you do master those arts, oh my lord is it satisfying. Finally hitting that moment where you perfectly deflect a bosses entire chain and get the deathblow is one of the most satisfying things I have ever done in a video game. Getting to that point where you completely and utterly destroy a boss with perfect deflects and counterattacks will never cease to make me feel like a badass. This game is a master of making you feel like you are truly good at it, as well as making you feel like you are truly god awful at it. It will test your will, and if you pass, will make you feel like you can take on anything. It's hard, but try to not go into this game thinking its going to be another Dark Souls experience, because you will be sorely mistaken and frustrated. This is not Dark Souls, this is Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and if you don't come to terms with that then you will not enjoy this game. Great game over all though, and the combat is really satisfying, performance is good but not great, try it if you like being actually challenged and tested with all of your skill.",10,2021-05-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user

24Kamspy,"I'd like to get this out there for people like me. I LOVE the Dark Souls series, but I was never any good with the parry. Straight sword and shield tank. Never even tried a parry outside of the Undead Burg I was so bad. Bloodborne wasn't even an option for me (could have been the 22fps). So I finally picked up Sekiro expecting to get demolished, but figured I'd finally try it out. I put it off for so long because I was told it's all about the parry, and I was terrible at Dark Souls parry. But guess what? It's waaay easier. Just the game as a whole. Not in a ""too easy"" way. It's still Dark Souls hard, but the parry system is much more forgiving and I'm actually pretty good at it. The moral of this long post is; if you **** at the parry in Dark Souls and are staying away from Sekiro because of it. Don't.

Ardiffaz22,"Clashing of swords at its finest. It was a bit overwhelming in the very beginning for me (and I've never played a Souls game before) but after some time I got used to the flow. And when you get the rhythm, it becomes the dance. Fast-pacing engaging combat which requires your concentration and punishes you for your every mistake. It plays fair and teaches you to fight perfectly and if you learn your lesson it will be the most satisfying combat ever. Very fluid animations and clashing sounds which become the music. But katana is not your only weapon, you can use tons of tools fit into the prosthetic arm, both offensive and defensive. Or you can ignore them completely and only use your sword. It doesn't have the variety of customization like in an RPG, but what it has, it is made perfect. Yes, it's hard, it requires you to 'git gud', and you will die a lot and suffer. I had so much rage during some of the fights, yet I have never even considered a rage quit. The learning curve of the difficulty is quite balanced: once you start to feel comfy, it gives you another challenge. So you'll never get bored, even after beating the game: you can go for additional NG+ playthroughs and make the game harder (yes, harder). Just give up Kuro's charm and ring the demon bell ;D But besides the combat, this game has some more to offer. The stunning visuals of mountainous Japan, filled with gorgeous castles and temples, detailed armor of human warriors and fascinating creatures, which, as I suspect, are inspired by Japanese mythology. The game on the whole feels very Japanese, but it doesn't require you to know almost anything about their culture beforehand. The story is clear and quite linear, yet you can have 4 different endings. There are not so many characters, but each one of them has a story to tell. Plus some pieces of lore can be found in item descriptions and environment. If you pay attention the lore becomes more deep and complex. Easily one of the best (or even the best) game I've ever played. Well done, FromSoftware.",10,2021-05-14,PLAYSTATION 4,user

A_good_username,"This is the best AND easiest FromSoft game. The story is from good to great at some places and the combat, ohh the combat! It is the most satisfying thing ever. Ever time you pull off a parry you feel like a badass. The level design isn't as Dark Souls 1 for example, but at the mid-point it branches out in 4 different directions to 4 different bosses. To be fair you can't complete a whole section without interacting with another one, but , in my opinion, that just encourages exploration more. The bosses are the best FromSoft has ever created and they are all distinct from each other and feel super satisfying to beat. The game, how ever near perfect it is, lacks multiplayer and a bunch of RPG elements expected in FromSoft games, but I just find the common Dark Souls stile a bit overwhelming, I personally prefer the simplicity that Sekiro offers. To wrap this up I have put around 130+ hours into this game and I love it to bits, it may not have the replay-ability as some other Soulborne stile games, but for me the core combat is fun enough to still be engaging after all this time. Also the free update they added recently has some more endgame content, other than new game + and is the most challenging thing (by far) in the game. This is a 10/10 masterpiece and is worth every cent. Good luck out there and remember to stay strong, Wolf!",10,2021-03-08,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Sure the world is pretty and its big, music is ok but it is the gameplay that will either pull or push the player away. This is probably the only game where I can safely say I am being biased and didn't enjoy the combat and the last boss was a test of my patience. In most other games you have at least a choice on how to deal with enemies, whether it will be different choice of weapons, range combat, different skills, stealth or just simply character / armor builds.... but not in Sekiro.

painava,Got the platinum trophy for this one. The game becomes a lot easier in subsequent play-throughs and acquiring all skills required too much mindless grinding. Super fun to play if not as memorable as Bloodborne or Dark Souls III.,9,2020-12-10,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Jrodmd1,"The best combat rpg game ever made. This game is tough, very tough. But once you slow down and realize that this isn‚Äôt going to be a cake-walk (just because you beat all the other souls-borne games) it becomes what is probably one of the most rewarding experiences in gaming you‚Äôll have. Fromsoft is aware of their fan base and really delivered with this game--a fresh new challenge.",10,2020-12-09,PLAYSTATION 4,user

AQbornking,"What make this game Great? The answer of this question is not that simple. Let discuss the unique factor of it. Just forget about dark souls for a moment. Protagonist starts with very low health, which will increase as you lean forward with the hardness of game and your decisions. This game have several mini bosses, bosses and several ways to slay them. Story of Sekiro is up to the mark too. And gameplay is massive. Items use in this is also make it unique. I have initially complain with the enemy respawn when you rest in sculptor. But that make sense for farming. Like pokemon when you go to the grass and wild pokemon appear or trainer in routes. For gold or level. It deserve 10/10.",10,2020-12-08,PLAYSTATION 4,user

WhiteClad,"This was my first Souls-like game and I have to say it took some time to get used to it. But after all it is the first game that gave me ""gamegasm"" - the indescribable satisfaction from killing a hard boss you've been fighting for a long time. This game really gave me the gaming experience, not just cutscene-watching and killing lame NPCs experience. You can really feel how you progress through the game exclusively because of your skill and not because grinding or, god forbid, lootboxes. Another thing that I like about it more that I did about Dark Souls 3 I played next, is that its fast. In DS3 I would sometimes rage when I got hit because my character was too slow, but in Sekiro I know - I got hit because I was slow. So if you're not afraid of challenge and have patience, this one is a must-have.",10,2020-11-29,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Not like other games, where you just spam the hit button and dodge button and the animation does allkind od things. In this game you have to play smart and cthink about every move.

Siralfon,"Una obra maestra como las que nos tiene acostumbrado from software . Sekiro fue una inovaci√≥n de from software que le coloca a mi parecer como el segundo de la empresa ( Solo por debajo de dark souls ) . El gameplay de sekiro es maravilloso , sistema de combate simple pero desafiante , la mec√°nica del gancho es utilizada en los combates de una manera muy interesante . Cada combate en sekiro se puede hacer de much√≠simas formas diferentes gracias al sigilo y a la verticalidad de los escenarios que nos permite enfrentar el juego de mil formas diferentes . El sigilo de Sekiro es un assasins creed bien hecho . Los enemigos son muy fuertes y puedes enfrentarte a ellos de cara ( no muy recomendado para primerizos ) o con sigilo asesinandolos de 1 golpe . El dise√±o de niveles esta magnificamente logrado , poseen verticalidad y en algunos casos estos cambian . En cuanto a los jefes son variados y muy bien dise√±ados , aparte de que son muy dif√≠ciles y para vencerlos puedes usar la mec√°nica del gancho o las habilidades de la pr√≥tesis . buen trabajo miyazaki :,)",10,2020-11-16,PLAYSTATION 4,user

TheKarterr,"Disclamer: I have plat in DS3 and BB and I know what I'm talking about. 1. Most important part of the game - fighting system was totally ruined. Not because it's not like SoulsBorne games, but because is bad: 1.1. The game forces you to respond in a way IT wants YOU to respond to utilise the mechanics that we supposed to be fun: 3 unblockable attacks and 3 ways to avoid them: jump, dash and ""front-dash repost/parry"". If you don't follow the rules - an attack will get you any way. 1.2. Bad indication- all 3 unblockables indicated the same way. For the ""immediate player reaction"" gameplay it's the worst way to do it. 1.3. Character is slow and not responsive. WTF?! How is that? The animations of taking damage are insanely long comparing to NPCs and bosses. Block animation as well: if you'll try to play the game ""honestly"" - parry just at the exact time once, without spamming the block button- you will fail because of the animations. Don't give me wrong, I love the idea of cool old style samurai 1v1 sword battle with all that sounds of clanking steel, but the way it is done in Sekiro - just ruining all that fantasy due to controls. 2. Plot, lore and setting - flat, no imagination, no mystery, no Japanese fantasy ((( Only the last location was ""special"", you know - something to remember. 3. Useless prosthesis. You just can't use all the gadgets you want all the time you want, because the game forces you to save it - because you have very little amount of amulets that consumes for every usage of every gadget. No build diversity. Hope, that Elden Ring won't have rubbish mechanics and the character will respond to PLAYER'S COMMANDS and not just only to game's rules.",3,2020-11-01,PLAYSTATION 4,user

The final boss and the last optional boss are the best examples. The game is not hard enough, let us make it harder with pure RNG! Good idea, From Software.

jindann,"This game has certainly one of the best graphics. However control wise its really bad, much of the difficulty is made out of bad control and cameras and rigging to kill you in 2 hits. Most of the so called master skills are as well like ****, a lot are completely useless, like having a execution time of 1 sec that you already got hit, think of it in a battle when you execute a skill would anyone wait you for a whole second for you to execute a master skill on them? the best skill in the game is actually basic normal attack that attacks instantly, which is completely stupid, and i dunno why spending a ton of time getting the skill sets for. I know its a tradition from the games of this company, but its just hilarious when the character is shinobi but its actually like a controlling a **** with stamina of a baby. he has to stick his ass as close to an enemy for an execution, otherwise it performs a normal hit and fail, and easily get killed by some pawn. Much of the time dying is from bad controls this game forces on players, losing focus, bad walled cameras, got cornered by multi enemy, or evasions blocked by wall, this is not fun, as much as a lot of players enjoying it, its actually quite a mess. Boss fighting again requires you to remember all his patterns its more of a memory game than action, and they are rigged to kill you in 2 hits most of the time, and mostly the battles are like chicken run fleeing from hits more than real battle. As a seasoned gamer certainly I dont enjoy a game when the control of the character is like a ****, with the stamina of a baby that dies in 2 hits, although its better doing it in game pad but in pc its just lame. the company should learn from action games like metal gear rising or zoe2, where it has much better speed and balance and the battles are certainly a lot more enjoyable than sekiros suffering.",3,2020-09-17,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Awanka,"The most incredible and challenging gameplay I've experienced in some time. Probably the first game that feels like real epic swordfighting. Very hard game. If Bloodborne is a 7 for difficulty, than Sekiro is an 8. The game is so fast-paced, you can die in a seconds with a few wrong moves. Interesting Eastern world setting. It reminded me a lot of the Blade of the Immortal manga, but with a strong supernatural theme. The game can be quite frustrating. This is the first FromSoft game that made me actually question if I actually could defeat certain bosses. When this game is at it's best though, and the perfect parries are ringing and blades are flying about, there is nothing like it. It reminds me of the intro for Ninja Gaiden 1 on the NES.

lonelybluey,"I have never been so addicted to and platinum'ed a game so fast in my entire life. This doesn't stray to far from the typical Soulsborne framework, but then deviates from it so far that it definitely stands on its own among FromSoftware's growing pantheon of classics. Initially I was so taken aback by the deviation that I didn't even get to the first boss. I just put it away and played something else, disappointed that I wasted my money on such an overhyped product, after my journey from Demon Souls all the way back in the PS3 era up to finishing Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne, I felt the itch for a new game from this company was not scratched. I was so disappointed. But I came back to this 3 months later, forced myself through learning the grappling mechanics, the parry move and the posture meter, the sneaking and deathblows, and when all the components clicked together, I was HOOKED. I devoured this game. Didn't play anything else for weeks. Every waking moment was spent thinking on how best to approach a new area, a new enemy, how to get through them with perfect parrys and no **** bosses, the environments, the music. If you can get through the initial hurdle of readjusting from a heavily armored knight, to a moderately armored hunter to finally a nimble shinobi, you owe it to yourself to play this gem.

It was insanely difficult and I couldnt wrap my head around its combat mechanics. Then I somehow stumbled all the way up to a certain boss, got pummeled a dozen times and **** clicked. I blocked, side stepped and jumped over his attacks and delivered punishment in a brutal but beautiful dance of death. I have now completed Sekiro 4 times and it cemented itself as one of my favorite games ever. I'm glad I didnt break that disc after all. Sekiro is From Software's most divisive game yet, but also its most focused. It delivers on everything it sets out to do. It innovates while remaining loyal to its roots and thats hard to achieve. Its also the most cohesive game from japanese developer in terms of its story. Hundreds of wiki pages are this time not required to understand the plot. Most RPG elements are thrown out of the window in favor of fast paced action and skill. I know everyone expected Dark Souls clone, but this aint that.

Graphics are okay, animations and sounds, artistic style and visual effects are awesome, and not too many bosses are frustrating to play against.

Descending23,"The games graphics and music are masterfully crafted, dare I say beautiful at times. Definitely a fresh breath of air from FromSoftware. Intriguing story, authentic swordplay, fun traversal, and unique progression system. I‚Äôve been a fan since Demon‚Äôs Souls for the PS3 all the way to Bloodborne and all the Dark Souls in between. Which is why this truly hurts me that I had to sell the game because I simply wasn‚Äôt having fun with it anymore due to the extreme difficulty. I got all the way up to the old monk and then I finally quit. My passion my enjoyment and and my will gave out. Instead of having an awesome time with this game I was instead looking up on YouTube finding ways to cheese these bosses and having no gratification with the end result, and when I thought the combat finally clicked here I was stuck with another impossible task. Every boss felt like a chore and not a ‚ÄúMount Everest‚Äù to climb... If this game had a mode that made it a little simpler I would re-buy it in a heartbeat. (Theres no online, so who would it really hurt besides egos?) And this is coming from somebody who has the platinum trophy for Bloodborne and put 250 hours into that game alone. So I hope somebody from FromSoftware reads this post and takes into consideration the next time they release a game that they don‚Äôt have to make it as difficult as possible for the game to sell to the point where it alienates most players. I still recognize the beauty of the game but I cannot except the difficulty. Fast forward a month... So I went and bought the game... again. I finally beat it. I gave this a game a 5 before, i'm bumping it up to an 8. I still stand by what I said, but the combat has grown on me. Lack of variety build really hurt this game.

The added stealth mechanics and verticality to the level design give another twist to the Souls formula, and sword fights are hands down the best I‚Äôve ever seen in a game to date. Also, the story is more explicit than in other From‚Äôs games and the boss fights and world design are sensational. It may be too difficult for newcomers and even for veterans of the Soulsborne franchise. Mastering the combat is a continuous proccess, but the level of satisfaction you feel is unmatched.

Mjn88,What a ride! From software has been a such a solid developer in the past and it‚Äôs nothing new here because this game is incredible! I was able to sink in over 40 hours into this game and boy was it fun/frustrating at times. Took me a minute to get the partying down but once I did. Chopping enemies and bosses down like cake was so satisfying! This games story isn‚Äôt anything to write home about but the combat and gameplay is what keeps you locked in and invested. All the bosses were of dark souls quality and I‚Äôm glad this game is very different from what other titles they make. Sekiro has its highs in its gameplay and lows in the story and graphics. I feel they could have done better with the animations and graphical fidelity but the satisfaction of the gameplay loop keeps the player engaged. I loved this game and I would recommend anyone who likes action RPGs and who is looking for a challenge to try it out.,9,2020-07-21,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Untill a certain boss when it did, it was almost like i had an awakening i didnt struggle as much, gameplay became so enjoyable and amazing i coudnt stop playing, the graphics are amazing , the only gripe i have is that the story isnt as ""deep"" as other fromsoft game like bloodborne and ds3, but yhats the thing it shouldnt be, youre playing it in the moment these events happen, the world is still alive, enemies arent hollowed out souls they are humans and while sometimes the ai is a bit abusable it still is enjoyable, not mentioning the replayability, coming from someone who beat the game 6 times i am more that confident saying, every time u play it u can have a different experience since its almost an open world with linear plot if u enjoy high octane gitgud challenging games then this is the game for you.",10,2020-07-19,PLAYSTATION 4,user

You are a shinobi not a samurai yet in almost every boss or mini boss you can't use your shinobi element as a shinobi you should be able to do things to the enemy that are not honorable yet you play as though you are just a guy with a sword and a arm with tools if you could just do more with the stealth it would make the game so much better but it feels like I'm just some guy with a sword with no concept of sneak attacks if it's any sort of major boss,1,2020-07-10,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Vaeu,"Certainly, a different beast from FromSoftware's usual but Sekiro is a fantastic game. The combat is different from souls and so it may be hard to adjust, with a focus on perfect deflections instead of perfect rolls - and of course, positioning too. The movement is fluid and does well to make you feel like a shinobi. The graphics and music are great too, the SFX with the deathblows and deflections sound so satisfying, but the boss music isn't as compelling as the Soulsborne bosses. The characters are intriguing and their stories are more in the open than usual souls game. On balance, Sekiro is a pleasant breath of fresh air from FromSoftware and a marvellously unique experience.",9,2020-07-09,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Storm02,"Sekiro is a game that i tried my hardest to like. Im a huge dark souls and bloodborne fan and i loved the games for their challenge... I just cannot say the same for sekiro. To me, the game feels like assasins creed and dark souls mixed together with clunky and overreactive controlls. Sometimes when i try to grab a ledge thats clearly marked, my character falls down and wall hugs. Jumps are hard to controll and i usually end up overshooting my enemy and getting spotted. The stealth kill mechanic sometimes dosent work and i strike my target instead, eventhough there is a red mark on them. The difficulty is more annoying than hard in my opinion and early game is a chore to play through the first time. If you dont play the way fromsoftware intended, you are not going to have fun, which in my opinion, kills all the fun and creativity in different playstyles. They could have done cool stuff with the setting. You could have been a stealthy ninja that could take out everything quickly or an awesome samurai that would dominate in combat. The lack of different weapons and attires just makes it feel boring imo. Fromsoftware has always let the player be who they wanted to be in their games, which is why i feel that sekiro is a step down from what i liked in their games. I know i have **** on the game for most og this review, now i want to state some positives. First off, beautiful game, love the setting aswell. Story is a bit more straitforward which is nice for newer players. 1v1 combat is awesome! And i truly feel like a badass destroying an inferior foe. Other than that, i really didn't like the game.

Skootly,"I really loved this game and the different combat style that from software created. There were some very frustrating glitches/broken aspects that made the game annoying rather than challenging at time. Some of the ways to dodge attacks make no sense, for example there is an attack from the demon of hate that you need to jump to avoid but jumping makes you pass through the enemy's attack sequence. However, if you completely side-step the attack completely you still take damage. There are a few of these dodges that make no sense and it really does take away from the experience but the game is still challenging and it had me wanting to finish each ending. Highly recommend if you enjoy challenging games and you don't have enough stress in your life.",9,2020-07-03,PLAYSTATION 4,user

ERRORCODE-20,Most Souls fan will view Sekiro in a bubble. The souls bubble. And since it doesnt have many of the rpg mechanics that souls-fans have come to expect they immediately write it off. But Sekiro isnt an RPG nor is it trying to be.,9,2020-07-02,PLAYSTATION 4,user
WarriorZ76,"Sekiro is the new From Software game that captures the essence of the souls-borne games and turns it into something excitingly fresh. GAMEPLAY The gameplay really differentiate from the Dark Soul saga. Elements of it are still there. Such as: The parry and dodge. But now, new additions such as a bigger focus in action and the stealth really change the way you approach the boss fights and the overall enemies. Also, I can't remember how many times I got frustrated because I couldn't defeat a boss. It's a game that requires patience and strategy. STORY I can't really judge the story of the game because it's really hard to understand. And that difficulty is due to the lack of care from the developers on conveying what the story is trying to say. You can understand elements of it and that is enough, which is good. Because you don't have to pay that much attention to the story since the gameplay makes up for it. But, as a person that loves narrative in games, it felt a little frustrating that I couldn't experience a good story. However, the lore of the game is awesome and also compensates the bad storytelling. BOSS FIGHTS The Boss Fights are INCREDIBLE! There was never a moment where I walked out of a boss fight and said: ""This is a bad boss fight."" From Software did a really good job on making each boss unique in it's combo variation and movement. The bosses need to be approached carefully.

Rizzy203,"Sekiro is a solid game that offers a lot of replayability, variety, a fantastic cast of characters & a truly likeable protagonist. Emma is a character with autonomy, who makes her own decisions, Kuro is a child who accepts an energising responsibility, & Genichiro is a Well written, truly tragic villain. The weapons are beautifully crafted & fun. Don‚Äôt be fooled by some players complaining about lack of variety; this game has plenty, as long as you‚Äôre willing to accept some changes. Sekiro wants you to forget what you know & embody Buddha; embrace simplicity. You have one sword & plenty of tools. Experimenting with them early game will help tremendously in the later game. From skills, prosthetics and combat arts, you can create seemingly endless variations of combos and develop a personal style that suits you. Each and every boss has a weakness that is extremely exploitable, with many also requiring patience. The movement is beautiful, the world is engaging and the Sengoku era wrapped in Japanese folklore is both aesthetically and culturally interesting. Sekiro manages to pull of something risky; removing levelling, weaponry/armour found throughout the world & asks the player to embrace a certain degree of simplicity from an aesthetic standpoint. The result is a clean & tight game. Thus, this game effectively clears the clutter of the previous games, trimming the fat and giving us the best parts of Souls. In short, Sekiro embodies the best of the best from previous titles and delivers the goods in a lovely & truly beautiful experience. The variety feels endless, the story is interesting & the characters are well written. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give it a 10, is simply because no game is perfect.",9,2020-06-24,PLAYSTATION 4,user

a-ma-bunny,"I wanna start from beginning. I've played Sekiro on my PC and I really really like that game at the start point. It's teaches you how to play from the battle to battle. Also I really enjoyed an atmosphere in this game because it looks really nice. I've passed about 50% of the game, sold my PC and got PS4. And I would complete it to the end. I've bought Sekiro second time. Played measuredly, slowly, enjoying each part of gameplay. But at the end it was dropped to the bottom as much as it possible in my eyes... I play with Isshin Ashina in the end and I really really wanna the hell out of those developers and creators. It's insane to play that battle with incorrect hit-boxes, 4 (!!!) phases of boss fight (including Genetiro Ashina, because he's fighting in one of phases that also have incorrect hitboxes when lower attack is going and double jump probably shall not work), 3 phases with the final boss and he's fighting with 3 (!!!) different weapons. Ask to the developers. HOW YOU IMAGINE THAT WHEN BOSS INSTANTLY SWITCHING THREE TYPE OF WEPONS WHEN HE'S JUST SWORD MASTER??? It's ridiculous. But it's not the main problem. With incorrect hit-boxes and at least a couple of missed attacks he's just killing you :). When you passed 2 phases well it goes to the hell. I'VE LEARNED HOW TO PLAY WELL BECAUSE I'VE NOT MISSED ALL THE DEATH ATTACKS. But when he don't stop to pushing you it looks really insane consider there is GREAT difference between first two phases. And he attacks with three types of weapons. And in the last phase there are four types of weapons (including lightning strike) + and many of melee attacks combining guns. Hell out that game. Repair god damn incorrect hitboxes!!! Don't you really see that's broken? In confirmation of my words just google that 'YouTube 8t4Qw9R1DnM'. It's my own video that demonstrates how bad hit-boxes works. And you have prosthesis. The most useless thing except of shuriken and **** when you play vs all bosses. But what a problem. When you've spend all spirit emblems LET'S GO AND GRID THAT. :) or just buy (if you have money ofc). And you can boost your hp and increase heal potions count. BUT WHAT A PROBLEM? Damage to you is a percentage. So strange solution. Only potions helps but not all the time. The last water drop I've got. You can ask 'But why that game has many of positive reviews with 10/10'. At the end I've got an achievement with this description 'Research all locations in the game'. And only 35% (nearly I think, maybe it's about 25%) of players reached that achievement. You can't go the end if you've not researched all locations. A curtain. 0/10. Lost my money. I'll try to finish that but now I just wanna delete and forget it as the most scary dream.",0,2020-05-28,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Teixeira,"For a guy who started playing videogames at the eighties with Ninja Gaiden, Sekiro is finally the game that you really feel that you are actually dueling with swords! Nice story and soundtrack, beautiful graphics, awesome gameplay and challenging difficulty (the most difficult Fromsoftware game). Maybe that's why many people rated it a bad game. Rightly deserved the GOTY 2019!!!!",10,2020-05-26,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Catalyst13,"In comparison to other souls-borne games, Sekiro is differently flavoured yet certainly enjoyable. I played immediately after playing Bloodborne and while both are fluid and action-filled, Sekiro stands out as you could almost feel the swords clashing. Few developers make you feel the weight of your character and weapon like From Software do. As many other reviews have stated, you have to unlearn everything the souls-borne games taught you about dodging and learn how to parry. I took a while for me until it clicked, but once it did this fights were enjoyable and challenging. Anyone could kill you if you don't play as the game wants you to play. On the other hand, this is no longer an RPG. Gameplay-wise, there are more elements of an action game like Tomb Raider than an RPG like Dark Souls which is not necessarily bad, but it is certainly quite different than previous games. The story is Ok and the storytelling is direct this time. I didn't need to dig through the forums or youtube to understand what was going on or why I was killing this boss. Graphics are good and the world is beautiful at certain points. Nothing special though. Level design is the standard From Software recipe, interconnected areas that separate the boss fights but the checkpoints are placed in at a more reasonable distance from boss fights which is good since you will die.. a lot. Overall, a great polished experience and enjoyable challenging game. Bloodborne is still my favourite though!",8,2020-05-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Johannus,"I really loved Demon's Souls, all three Dark Souls and Bloodborne, I even finished all of them several times. However, Sekiro was disappointment and generally not joy to play. It does not have good framerate on PS4 Pro, the level design is mediocre, the enemies are boring (most of them are sword bearing humans), the prayer beads mechanics is broken (all leveling up is only for skills, which are mostly worthless). The mechanic hand upgrades are also mostly useless and you are stuck with only one slow sword (except for the mortal blade which cannot be used for swordfight) - it means that you use one fighting style throughout all game and all you have to do is precisely deflect and/or dodge. The game even does not show you properly which critical attack is coming. The grappling hook would be fun if the game would run properly, however it looks like slideshow while jumping. The only improvement is critical attack from behind while crouching, but when you get the necessary skill, it works like in previous games. The overall setting is also mediocre. Nioh was much more fun. From software, sorry, but this game was not worth the time...",5,2020-05-22,PLAYSTATION 4,user
ricjen27,"BE PATIENT - IT IS WORTH IT! Face the learning curve & Sharpen your reflexes. :-) This is a beautiful game in so many ways.. and the fact that learning to play it well takes some time once you do master it, it is so enjoyable and rewarding. My recommendation is take your time, do each area slowly and many times if necessary before passing to the next. You will get better. And when in trouble there are so many walkthroughs out there that you can look at how other people managed and try different approaches. I am not a 'Gamer' and for sure not one of the best players, so It is accessible to anyone who is willing to give it the time. It will pay off because the game surprises again and agin, with surprising poetic moments, and beautiful sceneries.. But yes it is a fighting game.

uncle-scrooge,"Sekiro contains numerous recognizable elements from From Software's previous title, but they have proven themselves once again fully capable of going in other creative directions and coming out on top. Sekiro is a beautiful adventure game that draws you into a world that you are dying(!) to explore. It's without a doubt their most fantastic looking game to date (though purely as a matter of taste I preferred the dark grittiness of Bloodborne), and the fact that Sekiro can use his grappel hook to travel vertically too makes it an entirely different adventure than its ""predecessors"". First, some good stuff The game is gorgeous. It's a breath of fresh air from the darkness of Dark Souls and Bloodborne, and it's inspiring to see the team being able to put their creativity to work in a very different direction. In the past, I've found the Dark Souls storytelling variant to be a bit too difficult to decipher, Bloodborne had a great story that required dedication and research, and Sekiro follows that up with an even more spelled out story, still with lots of room for interpretation. The enemy design is varied, ranging from clumsy swordsmen to magical creatures you want to stop and simply observe for their awesome look and moves, practically screaming for you to research their lore. The sneak mechanics may not offer a whole lot new to gaming in general, but it's still incredibly satisfying to successfully backstab an enemy, especially since some of them can be incredibly difficult if you fight them in a normal way. I like this approach of even the toughest enemies being open to a crushing backstab if that's your style. The fighting style is action-filled and very different from earlier From games, but that also brings me to the more negative points. It's hard to speak of these games without mentioning difficulty. Getting to the end of Sekiro is, of course, a challenge, to say the least. Director Hidetaka Miyazaki has repeatedly stated that they try to make the games ""tough, but fair"", a description that fits the previous titles. And indeed, balancing the feeling of being challenging without being too hard to be fun is not an easy task, and one that most game developers simply sidestep by making their games easy by default or adding difficulty levels. Sekiro doesn't quite find that balance in the way its predecessors did, and there are several reasons for this. 1) No From Software games have ever had an ""easy mode"", but they have still had ways to make the most challenging bosses doable, by letting you invite other players, summoning NPC's or simply grinding a few levels to power up your character. Sekiro doesn't let you do any of these things. If you're stuck, you're stuck. For a casual player like me, it would sometimes mean getting stuck on the same boss for weeks, which is too long for me. 2) DS and Bloodborne allowed for different playing styles, letting you personalize your character in a way that fits how you want to play. Your particular style may make some bosses more difficult, and others easier. Sekiro wants you to play one way, and if you're not up for it... you're going to be frustrated. You better get used to timing your parrying down to milliseconds and learning each and every move of 30-40 bosses. I'll gladly admit this is not my playing style, and I find even regular enemies so frustratingly difficult to beat that I avoid battle whenever I can. The boss fights are... well... just not fun. That's my best way to describe it. They're too difficult to be enjoyed, and there's also my next point... 3) Fights are LONG. I'm currently fighting the last boss of the game, and without spoiling much, I can say it's of course a multi-phase boss. The first two phases are not too difficult, but MAN do they drag out. You can easily spend 20 minutes reaching the third phase, and you'll feel the difficulty being cranked up to ridiculous amounts. So, basically, that's the phase that kills you. Which is all fine and dandy, except that you have to go through those long, tedious first phases EVERY time you try again. This is just an example of something that happens repeatedly throughout the game. Fights go on forever, and then you die from one simple mistake. Learning new skills and prosthetic tools are fun to watch, but only a few of them make any actual significance in battle. In the end, no matter how many skill points you've gathered during your adventures, your ability to time your parries is what determines the outcome. I'm sure some players love that, but... I don't. I found several boss battles to be a chore more than an enjoyment. My advice is... try it. I still loved it, despite my frustrations with the difficulty for my particular playing style. They didn't hit the difficulty balance perfectly in Sekiro in my opinion, but that doesn't take away the fact that it's still a beautifully made game with an interesting story, great overall design and mostly satisfying mechanics",8,2020-05-13,PLAYSTATION 4,user
YourTherapist,"I have been playing for weeks, and I‚Äôm hooked! The game is very difficult and especially hard during the ogre. Most of the bosses don‚Äôt have a ‚Äúweakness‚Äù that you can exploit which in turn makes you more skilled when progressing. Many times you will have to search up how to get better if it gets to hard but normally it doesn‚Äôt really happen. The game really gets hard during the boss fights because they're unforgiving and you will have to come up with counter measures yourself. For some reason every time I die to a boss I always learn more and want to keep trying. Sometimes you will be up against very hard enemy‚Äôs but if you keep trying you‚Äôll eventually get it. One thing about sekiro is that you will have to be very good at the base combat of the game because there aren‚Äôt any really amazing ‚Äúspecial‚Äù abilities that aren‚Äôt used in niche situations. The game will eventually click and will become super fun but before that you‚Äôll just be figuring out the game. When it clicked for me I was fighting Genichiro Ashina and when I finally beat him I just got really good.

doberman7,"Clunky controls, odd hit box and a repetitive mechanic. The hype and controversy made this game famous besides that, this game does not offers anything, its not even a terrible game, something that make you laugh. Don't buy this, its overpriced, his cost should be something about 4 USD, as the unfinished product that it is. Even if you beat a boss, it feels like lucky event, not that you have learn somethingor o geting good on it, its even unffair with the IA, it randomly loses. Those who praise this, its my thinking, feel like they are cool, because its tough, but integral calculus its tougher and that don't make it cool. The fun part its that From Software has left his best work in the past, from here, its like the Tony Hawk series, just going down. If your curious about the product, buy it used and on physical to re-sell it. Another interest thing its that in the case of PS4, the percentage of trophies obtained its really low, 30% its the average of obtantion of many of the trophies, my reasoning its that its not the difficulty, its more that people get bored and prefer to use his time on something else.

Electrohead,"Before starting my review, I want to put into context that I have played and beaten Demon's Souls, every Dark Souls, Bloodborne as well Nioh; and Sekiro is by far the most difficult of these games by quite a large margin. Sekiro takes the 'Souls' formula and puts a twist on it by changing up the focus to add in stealth as well as a more aggressive combat system that's based around parrying and countering, rather than timed dodges. It's a very difficult change to get used to, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes very rewarding. However; Sekiro is the first time that I felt that From Software pushed the envelope too far in terms of difficulty. There are a number of bosses in this game that can feel completely ridiculous to the point where it's no longer fun and becomes impossibly hard. The game also has a bad habit at times of surrounding a mini-boss with tough enemies that are hard to isolate and ends ups feeling difficult because you're facing multiple foes in a combat system designed for one-on-one combat. The game's punishment for dying can be too severe, which is taking away half of your XP and money. Unlike the Souls games, you cannot go back to where you died to regain your loses and are instead at the mercy of the 'Unseen Aid' system which has a 30% chance of taking away the death penalty. This percentage goes down after repeat deaths unless you use a certain consumable item. This sounds like a massive flaw, which at times it is, but the core gameplay and exploration is sublime. When you finally start to 'get' Sekiro, the game becomes incredibly fun and even when you're stuck on a tricky boss you usually have multiple areas to explore. Thankfully, this is well worth your time as exploration is rewarded with items that will make your gameplay experience much smoother. Now more than ever, exploration is rewarding and essential. The stealth system is great too. The game throws you a bone and most mini-bosses can be made much easier by sneaking in a stealth blow, taking away a significant amount of health. This turns some battles into a bit of a puzzle. The challenge becomes finding a way to take out any enemies in sight and finding a safe sneaking path to the boss. When you pull this off it gives you the true feeling of being a shinobi. Sekiro has some of the most ridiculous brick walls you will ever hit in a game, but when you force yourself to learn the game and its intricacies, it becomes massively rewarding. It also has great replay value since 'new game plus' allows you to shoot for different endings and easily speed-run the game and rush to the best parts.",9,2020-05-05,PLAYSTATION 4,user

GaaraDDragon,"Sekiro is an absolutely amazing game. Some of the most responsive gameplay EVER. It's like playing naruto, metal gear and Spiderman at the same time. The eye candy of this game is jaw dropping. Probably the closest FROMSOFT has gotten to AAA appeal. But it doesn't quite reach the level of the trilogy: Demon's Souls, Dark Souls and Bloodborne for one reason: the bosses. They are pedantic, repetitive and frankly feel like ""bullet sponges"". They have insane health bars and deal insane damage. They completely break the flow of the game. And even when I beat them it feels like total fluke instead of skill because of all those random almost insta kill moves the bosses have.

It‚Äôs not made for good players, it‚Äôs made for persistent players, which I love. I actually kinda **** at video games, it took me upwards of 50 tries to beat some bosses, but it feels so rewarding when you do. Also, I think people need to understand that this isn‚Äôt a dark souls game. Stop leaving negative reviews comparing it to dark souls.

Previous games in the series were hard but at least felt like they wanted to be beaten, and they encouraged you to try different ways to defeat a tough challenge. This game does not want to be beaten. It absolutely despises the player and will kill you over and over and over again without a single chance because it just hates you that much. It's unreasonable how absolutely crushing this game is. It's a game that demands you to play it only the way that it wants you to and to be absolutely 100% perfect, and after a while it just stops being fun. This game is not fun. It's a chore, and playing it was probably the most depressing experience I've ever had in 20 years of playing video games. It's handily the worst game From has ever made and it's not even close.

Maurenos,"I thought Nioh was a bad dark souls clone. Well, here we are - Sekiro: controls die thrice. This game was supposed to be based on sharp reflexes, instead you have to either dodge or hide instead of dodging and countering the sword attacks. Also, your character is terribly slow compared to enemies and can be basically killed with 2 attacks. I don't know who thought that using dark souls mechanic in this game would be a good idea. It's not working correctly, so you either mash buttons or attack using some weird techniques. And your shurikens do little or no damage at all - I guess every enemy in the game's world knows how to dodge them. I am really disappointed, considering the fact that the game was heavily advertised. BTW, on ps4 slim, the game has issues with performance from time to time. If you want to play something like dark souls, then this game is not a good recommendation. I suggest spending your money somewhere else.",3,2020-04-17,PLAYSTATION 4,user

tenant_low,"A vapid game with little to offer but difficulty. Of the forty odd hours you spend with it, thirty-six will be spent running up against against bosses over and over again. This is why you can‚Äôt summon and there isn‚Äôt any kind of difficulty moderation - skip the bosses and there is basically nothing here. The difficulty is raised beyond reasonability in order to pad out the play time and compensate for the absence of meaningful content in the narrative, worldbuilding, or systems. A shallow story, a boring world, just a string of pointlessly hard bosses. The systems are almost entirely useless and not worth exploring. The combat mechanics are misguided - posture bar recovery creates this constant feeling of lost progress: you can sustain perfection for long stretches, only to watch all your effort negated when an enemy backsteps. Imagine a Dark Souls game where all bosses have auto-potion. That's basically Sekiro. Would I feel this way if the game was not FromSoft? If I didn‚Äôt go in expecting a Souls game? If this were, say, a Metal Gear Rising Revengeance sequel? Yes, and on the contrary, I would not have committed so much time to the game had I not gone in expecting greater depth as the game went on.

The other issue is that disk version of this game **** on Xbox One. It slows down all the time, and the loading screens take 30s, and each cutscene takes 15s to load. It's not optimized for Xbox One.

Tu giochi con un pagliaccino che ha armi assurde ma devi infliggere triliardi di danni a una vecchia per farle male, loro con un pugno ti stendono. Hanno moveset ridicoli con finestre per colpirli al millisecondo. La dinamica della malattia per le morti e le resurrezioni (mal di drago) √® completamente inutile. L'ho finito perch√© mi √® stato detto che era bello ma a mani basse √® il peggior soulslike mai visto. √à quasi un offesa considerarlo tale. Gli oggetti prostetici, il ninjustsu.. insomma tutte le abilit√† ald fuori dell'attacco normale solo completamente futili eccetto le castagnole, le altre non avrete tempo di usarle contro i boss casomai non le utilizzate veramente con una finestra PERFETTA. Nei ""fal√≤"" ci sono dei men√π ancora pi√π aberranti come ""migliora potenza d'attacco"" dopp che battete un boss. Opzione completamente inutile. Sistema di leveling esiste? Si, per comperare le abilit√† che (vi ricordo) sono INUTILI. Ergo dovete solo affrontare in maniera ripetitiva boss noiosi, con una storia noiosa per chiss√† quante volte di fila finch√© non imparate il suo moveset per poi andare avanti e ripete questa meccanica. Sarebbe stato bello implementare le parate e le schivata aumentando l'importanza della postura, una volta abbassata la postura si sarebbe potuto infliggere il colpo di grazia all'avversario. Invece no, la postura √® pressoch√© inutile. Voi la recuperate in anni anche da fermi, i boss in attimi e la velocit√† di recupero loro scala con la loro salute, ergoper abbattere una loro fase dovrete (nel 90% dei casi) toglierli comunque tutta la salute rendendo INUTILE la loro barra della postura.

Nerevarinho,"Tutorial was good, it was a good balance between story and fight. Then you are thrown into a stretched out map filled with annoying enemies. Grapple Hook feature makes no sense, since you have to explore the map on the floor for finding important items. So the Map is designed to grapple hook all over the place like in Arkham City, without sense, just to sell a feature. Enemies are not fun to kill, combat makes not fun, you barely see the stun meter of the enemies, and your lifebar goes down too quickly. When multiple enemies attack, it gets hectic and escape may end on a cliff death. I have not the pacience to pull every enemy at once and do the same combat moves all over again. After monotone fight through the level until reaching a miniboss, i decided to upgrade myself somehow, after all, my experience bar had level 2. But how to become more powerful? I thought lets try at the upgrade guy at the starting zone. Due to a found amulet, the upgrade guy throws me into a new level without my permission, and the level is designed the same, a very long level with annoying enemies to chore through. It was so annoying, at some point ran through, reaching a white-invisible wall, the game forced to do this annoying combat. If the combat was at least more fluid and responsive, I may have forced me through. Also other stuff annoyed me, like press-and-hold-X to loot the money from enemies with a magic magnet (from enemies that may also be far away due to hectic multiple-enemies combat). Or the repetitive combat music, I could not hear it anymore.",5,2023-05-26,XBOX ONE,user

Deltapivo,"This game is almost the pinnacle of From Software's game design. Its combat has a simple premise, but a steep learning curve. It deviates from traditional souls combat in the sense that you are not evading attacks and looking for openings to strike, you are parrying attacks (and evading or countering specific attacks) and attacking when possible for your objective is to either bring the enemy hp to 0 (which is only a viable strategy for a few enemies/bosses) or, most of the time, fill up their posture bar, which depletes over time if you are not constantly engaging with the enemy by parrying or attacking. This creates a flow to the combat that is rarely seen in other games; it is as if you were dancing with the enemy. There are also tools (called prosthetic tools) that you can use to aid you in combat. They make certain situations easier and create more diversity for the combat. But one can argue that this is a indirect form of easy mode (in which case I agree), since it can facilitate some fights by a considerable margin. The bosses are, for the most part, excellent. A good part of this game's bosses forces you to nearly perfect the game's combat in order to beat them, but throughout the game there are several mini-bosses that serves as means of practicing the combat, so that you, when you reach a proper boss fight, at least know how to approach the fight and how to evolve while trying to beat the boss: The game teaches you how to play, and helps you set a foundation on how to perfect the combat. The game progression is linear until a certain point; it's not as open as Dark Souls 1 neither as streamlined as Dark Souls 3. The game's music isn't really memorable, and since it has to fit into a japanese setting it doesn't have much variety. But the music is well composed and it's certainly fitting for the game. Most bosses in the game have more than one hp bar, and this somewhat applies to you, the player. After dying, you can resurrect, albeit with only half hp. This serves as a good second chance, in case you died for a futile reason (this happens to all of us playing From Software's games), and a good mechanic overall to extend the flow of gameplay and not interrupt it so often. The levels have a lot of verticality. This allows the player to make extended use of the grappling hook, a mechanic that was never present in a From Software game before. You will traverse cliffs and rooftops with the grappling hook, it extends the exploration of the levels and present you a way of avoiding combat or using the environment in your favor to aid you in combat, e.g., jumping from a rooftop and performing a deathblow. The stealth can be seen as another mechanic that facilitates the game, since, if performed correctly, won't make you engage with the enemies and will allow you to perform deathblows, i.e., you will kill them instantly. In some scenarios, stealth is highly recommended, e.g., an area with a mini boss surrounded by enemies, where you would kill the enemies first by means of stealth and then engage with the mini boss. Unfortunately, there isn't much incentive to kill the enemies throughout the game, you can simply run through the level until you reach the next idol (this game's version of bonfires), and repeat the process until you reach a boss or another objective. The story isn't cinematic and subversive as other games, but it also isn't told in the same way as other From Software's games. The story is more latent than in other From's games, you will be able to understand at least most of the plot. The story is good, sufficient for a game like this while presenting the player with pivotal choices and some twists. Overall this game is great, incredible even. It has one of the best combat systems I've ever seen in a game, excelent boss fights (for the most part), a very good story and a beautifully crafted world. Although it has it's shortcomings, the good certainly outweights the bad. But I wouldn't recommend this game for everyone, it is challenging, VERY challenging. One can find it easier than other From's titles, but objectively speaking, it is the hardest From Software game, and the one with the steepest learning curve. But if you are up for a challenge, this is a very rewarding game.",9,2023-04-04,XBOX ONE,user
ZackH25,"For me although a great game it is somewhat overrated. Firstly the areas, the bosses/ mini bosses and most the enemies are very well designed. My favourite boss has to be the Genichro boss fight as it was quite epic, a fair challenge if prepped well and when summoned lighting it was very exciting. The level design was also great. The main problem is with combat. Combat is good but it forces you to only play in a few ways. This is because it only lets you use one main weapon plus a few items. So there is less customisation and ways to play in this game compared to other souls game. I know they were trying to make you learn deflecting but more ways to win and beat the game would have been better",8,2023-03-28,XBOX ONE,user

Second is the Position of the checkpoints, sometimes there like a whole city with no checkpoint and sometimes there‚Äòs like one house between theme. Anything else is just great. The graphics are even for 2022 very **** story i not great, but not bad too. The combat system is the best i know, every fight feels great, of course it‚Äòs not such flexible cause you have just one main weapon, but that not so important cause the developers did it to make a perfect balanced weapon which is just ultra fun to play with. Some people say because there‚Äòs only one weapon which you cant upgrade it don‚Äòt feel rewarding but most things you find have a reason why they are ingame. Most fun are the bosses many people say they are to difficult but they‚Äòre just bad (and the first game from from software I played is elden ring which many peoply say is a ÀãeasyÀã from software game and sekiro has arround the same difficulty) it just feel like a dance he hits, you parry, you hits he parry, sounds very boring but feel such great.

uncleblazer,"this is the best game i've ever played. not going to be for everyone since it isn't a traditional souls game and it can be very hard at times. the combat is top tier, very deep and a lot of ways to play with the different tools and arts. game story is great, i really like all the endings, you have to do some digging to get a lot of context for the story but i found it worth it. has some of the best boss fights. the human bosses are good but a couple of the beast bosses are amazing. game looks and sounds great. voice actors for english and japanese are awesome they did really good work. add sekiro dlc or sequel to the long list of things fromsoftware needs to be working on.",10,2023-01-03,XBOX ONE,user

pmart004,"Um jogo sensacional, dif√≠cil e que n√£o √© para crian√ßas! O jogo possui 2 pontos fortes na minha opini√£o: - A hist√≥ria: o t√≠tulo n√£o possui tantas cutscenes quanto outros jogos costumam ter. √â necess√°rio prestar muita aten√ß√£o aos di√°logos com NPCs espalhados pelo mundo, pois s√£o eles que te dar√£o pistas - mas n√£o muitos detalhes - do que se deve fazer a seguir. A narrativa desta forma se torna mais desafiadora e exige muita aten√ß√£o do jogador. - Progress√£o: o combate √© simples, mas ao mesmo tempo complicado. O t√≠tulo possui uma pegada de progress√£o diferente. Em boa parte dos jogos de a√ß√£o e aventura, o jogador evolui o personagem, subindo seu n√≠vel e conquistando equipamentos e habilidades que o tornam naturalmente mais forte que seus inimigos, muitas vezes eliminando a dificuldade nas batalhas. Entretanto, Sekiro, apesar de possuir uma progress√£o semelhante na conquista de XP de personagem e novas habilidades, o ponto forte n√£o √© esse! A experi√™ncia mais relevante no jogo, √© a que voc√™ (pessoa) ganha como jogador! O que quero dizer com isso, √© que ao jogar e morrer diversas vezes, batalhar contra inimigos extraordin√°rios, voc√™ ganha experi√™ncia pessoal, que faz mais diferen√ßa do que a experi√™ncia adquirida pelo seu personagem! Experimente dominar a gest√£o da sua Postura e a repelir ataques com defesa no √∫ltimo instante ou o contra-ataque Mikiri no caso de investidas, e sua gameplay ser√° t√£o mais rica, que seus equipamentos e t√©cnicas ser√£o quase irrelevantes! Num bom sentido, dominar o que h√° de mais b√°sico no jogo √© mais importante do que adquirir habilidades e equipamentos melhores. O mitovo da nova n√£o ser 10, √© que a vers√£o do jogo que √© executada no Xbox Series S √© a mesma do Xbox One Base, enquanto a que roda no Xbox Series X √© a mesma do Xbox One X (com melhorias e otimiza√ß√µes). Vai uma sugest√£o: seria perfeitamente poss√≠vel entregar no Xbox Series S uma vers√£o com Resolu√ß√£o 1080p + 60fps ou 1440p + 60fps. O que enriqueceria imensamente a gameplay dos jogadores! Um jogo como este que exige reflexos e respostas r√°pidas dos jogadores enfraquece em muitos aspectos de divers√£o, imers√£o e satisfa√ß√£o ao jogar.",9,2022-12-29,XBOX ONE,user

Hitjhon,"Primero que nada quisiera empezar diciendo que le juego es simplemente genial. Si ya son fans de Dark Souls no tienen que preocuparse. Este juego tiene la calidad esperada de cualquier juego de la saga Souls. Muy Recomendado. Ahora bien aqu√≠ empiezan los problemas que me parecen que para esta versi√≥n espec√≠ficamente deber√≠an solucionarse ya que al ser el publicador Activision el precio no va a bajar al menos no significativamente. El primer problema es uno de la saga souls en general y en este juego ya me pareci√≥ mas inc√≥modo es definitivamente la c√°mara, a estas alturas no entiendo porque no se ha solucionado. El otro problema que encontr√© es los servidores que a veces simplemente no funcionan y por ende no se puede jugar. Y por √∫ltimo el problema relacionado a la versi√≥n del juego correspondiente a Xbox One es que si se tiene una consola de nueva generaci√≥n como la Series S en mi caso el juego corre 30 FPS que no son para nada suaves parecen que caen pero seg√∫n tengo entendido es otro problemas me parece que lo llaman ritmo de FPS. Y esto se relaciona al problema de que Activision no rebaja sus juegos y que adem√°s sacaron una versi√≥n de ""juego del a√±o"" el a√±o anterior y sinceramente este no es un juego de 60 d√≥lares (la versi√≥n de PC s√≠). As√≠ de sencillo. Con todos los problemas que mencion√© recomendar√≠a comprar en descuento y si es posible una key mucho m√°s rebajada.",7,2021-10-29,XBOX ONE,user

Glad I got it on sale but wish I had read more negative reviews before I bought it, all those tens fooled me. My own fault. Buyer beware, loving Dark Souls doesn't mean you will love this one.

Goated23,"FromSoftware has built this game using the best aspects of the Souls and Bloodborne series. creating a stealth-action experience. In some ways it is more forgiving, such as save points being much closer together, but the game still required split-second reflexes and a fine attention to details. Sekiro‚Äôs level design is much more vertical than Tenchu, so when overwhelmed, there is almost always a way to maneuver out it like a true Ninja would. The stealth elements of Sekiro allow you to get into many positions for silent assassinations or simply explore the varied environments. The trailers never featured much stealth footage, but it is actually very stealth heavy.

Sopshi15456,"Not because I expected it to be bad, but rather how much better it was than initially expected. I enjoyed my fair share of Souls games so far, since I fell in love with the series right from the awkwardly silent release of Demon's Souls ‚Äì and yet From Software continues to surprise me again and again. At heart Sekiro plays more like an unique mix of Soulsborne & Dishonored, with obvious parallels to the Tenchu series, yet combat is so ridiculously focused. Every single encounter is designed with rhythm and personality in mind ‚Äì once you learn a bosses pattern, you'll be able to dominate him on every following playthrough. You don't just get used to the controls, but rather fully embrace their simplicity and focus. Enjoyed the game so much, I felt the need to 100% complete it immediately.",10,2021-06-16,XBOX ONE,user
Xenos56,"Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is the latest game released by Fromsoft, the studio that made its name producing legendary games such as the Dark Souls trilogy and Bloodborne, to massive international acclaim. Sekiro was no slouch in this department either, handily claiming numerous GOTY awards for itself upon its release, further proving that there is still a market for incredibly challenging games. While Sekiro isn‚Äôt for everyone, and it does have its problems, it is a completely unique experience in the heavily saturated Triple-A gaming world, and very well may be worth your time and money.",10,2021-06-16,XBOX ONE,user

Jawstrong16,"I hated this game when I first started it. It was my very first From Software game, and I was not at all prepared for the steep difficulty curve. I only got it because one of my best friends kept recommending it to me, and although I had heard that it was hard, I had no idea how brutal it actually was. Still, I kept at it, and the moment the combat clicked, I instantly saw it in an entirely new light. The combat is fast-paced and exhilarating, and every death is just another lesson. In order to build you up into a Shinobi killing machine, Sekiro first has to break you down repeatedly. And the game scales the difficulty as you go, making sure that there's always a new challenge to throw yourself at. The graphics are absolutely beautiful, and the story is also rich and compelling. Sekrio: Shadows Die Twice is a masterpiece worthy of recognition, and anyone who is up to the challenge should play it.",10,2021-06-16,XBOX ONE,user
TechForcer485,Sekiro is like Guardians of the Galaxy. You have to dance to defeat your enemies. If you dance better than your enemy then you will win. On more serious note here are things I like about this game. Pros - Better than Dark Souls (I played every Dark Souls game) - Harder than Dark Souls. This game is more about timing your attacks. - Best sword combat I have ever seen in a game - Atmospheric. They nailed the feudal Japan feel. - Nice soundtrack - Highly replayable. There are 4 endings. Some endings will make you fight new bosses. - Great boss fights - Very polished and optimized Cons - You are not dancing right if you think there is any. 11/10 Would dance again.,10,2021-06-16,XBOX ONE,user

This game makes you feel like the ultimate beast when everything clicks, I can play over and over again and never get bored,I've beat it like 50-60 times already, did several speedruns, challange runs, boss rushes, beating the game without dying, FromSoftware is truly the GOAT developers, can't wait to see what they do with Elden Ring.",10,2021-06-16,XBOX ONE,user
Austicsaviant69,"+ The art-style fits the Sengoku Japan setting of the game pretty well. + Similar to From's previous games, there are checkpoints you have to search for. + Combat is pretty fun once you understand how it works. (There is a certain boss who will force you to understand how combat works. This boss is ) + Multiple endings. + Stealth in this game is fun as opposed to the boring stuff you see in other games. + Fun boss fights. + The game rewards you for exploration. + Japanese voice acting in this game is top-notch. + Lots of varied areas and enemies. You will fight humans, monkeys, monsters and more monkeys. Lots and lots of monkeys. +- The game is very fast-paced. This is alright once you get used to it but might feel too hard while playing the game for the first few hours. +- Some soundtracks were fun to listen to. Some were ""ok"". - While I like challenging games, this game felt too punishing. Getting hit two to four times while fighting bosses means you are dead. Moreover, some attacks are fast and will one-shot you which is something I haven't encountered in From's previous games. One-shots have always been clearly telegraphed in their previous games (remember Lorian's beam in DS3?) but for some reason they did not follow the same rule in this game. - It can take a long time trying to beat some bosses/mini bosses only for you to get killed for getting hit twice.

This game is an absolute joy to play, and it's an experience from start to finish, while it's a Niche genre I do believe this game is a masterwork and an example to other game developers.

Delta98,"Having just got the final achievement at NG+4 I have to say it is one of the best games I have played. Being the huge Soulsborne fan I am this was a really refreshing take to the already polished From Software **** game takes place during the Sengoku era of Japanese history in the land of Ashina. You play as shinobi Wolf tied up in a battle over the powers of immortality whilst seeking revenge on the samurai clan who attacked you and kidnapped your lord. In comparison to previous From Software titles, the gameplay is very fast paced with a much higher focus on skill rather than stats. The game strips you of your ability to customize stats, choose between weapons and vary your build and instead creates a much more focused and well polished experience where all elements of gameplay feel much more thought out and planned; the game does not suffer the issue of ""too many weapons"" and instead allows you to vary your play only a bit in terms of combat arts. It is not for everyone. It is a very difficult beast to master and takes a lot of patience and practice. However this all pays off as the experience becomes much more rewarding when you finally master that boss you have been stuck at for hours and instead of just beating him with great stats or luck, you realize that you have learned the boss and become better at the game. This invokes a true feeling of progression and reward that just leveling cannot give. To conclude, the game is not for everyone. If you are looking for a challenging but fair experience that actually takes effort and skill to beat and not just tedious grinding, this might be the game for you. For fans of the Soulsborne series I highly recommend the game, however know that your previous experience will work against you in the start; you will have to re-adapt to this new and amazing experience.",10,2021-06-14,XBOX ONE,user

Lexnextdex21,"One of the best games i've played so far. As a fan of soulsborne series i must say i love this game! It's without a doubt both easier and harder in different aspects than the previous souls games. The general enemies are easier than they have ever been because you can stealth kill everybody in the level if you choose to but then the mini bosses and actual bosses come along... They aren't the most difficult bosses but they are very challenging and there are very few options to power up and brute force your way through a boss. You can farm xp and money to buy new skills and other things but you can't raise your base stats. If you aren't sure of yourself or willing to improve you could hit a brick wall after a few hours and give up. Combat is very responsive and nearly all the problems like phantom hits, delayed actions after button presses, and unresponsive controls from the souls series have been fixed. On my 1650 at 1080p I get a solid 60fps on a mixture of max and high settings so the game runs well also much better than previous Fromsoft **** soundtrack beautifully complimented each area and encounter. It's one of the most impactful and memorable scores from their library I have played. I'm an explorer and love finding secrets. Trust me, there are tons of those as you progress and you're rewarded for going off the beaten path. So the game will most likely satisfy you about that. I also don't recommend using any guides on your first playthrough and experiencing everything first hand. Try not to get too angry when you sit back and enjoy ancient castles, bamboo forests, acid swamps, mountain side temples, forsaken villages, and more in this journey you're about to take. Also keep in mind that you will die a lot more than twice.",10,2021-06-14,XBOX ONE,user

Coldrolnal7,"As someone that has poured many, many hours into the previous FromSoft titles, dying repeatedly until I was able to either get lucky or I was able to ""git gud"", I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this is the only real thing Sekiro has in common with those games. You will die. A lot. Way more than twice. Just..a lot. This is not a Soulsborne game. You are not some powerful knight capable of face-tanking every entity you come across. You are a ninja. The game will remind you constantly of this fact. You are free to play as dirty as you know the enemies will. Poison them, set them on fire, stab them in the butt when they are not looking and then Spider-Man away. Who cares! Just kill them before they kill you. If there is anything to take away from my rambling, it is simply this. You are shinobi. You are not a samurai or knight. So don't expect to play as one and you and this game will get along well!

Flound4er,"Playing through Sekiro for the first time was the greatest gaming experience of my life. Never has a game meant so much to me. Like all the Souls, this game is pure immersion--It speaks to you in every detail. And the difficulty drives you deep into the this immersive experience, where you find yourself gritting your teeth, riveted to the screen and fighting with all your might to just stay in it a little longer. To deflect and to dodge and to land just one more hit! Time and again, Sekiro had me falling out of my chair, stunned with the realization of what I must do... Twice! The resurrection mechanic just further enriches the experience, forcing you to become the ultimate shinobi master and and not only beat a boss, but completely to annihilate it... or at the very least to just barely out-live it, surviving and succeeding by the tiniest of margins. What a game! As a Souls fan (both dark souls and various other souls-like games), this game is just a treasure. It excels in areas Dark Souls cannot. Being provided with only one main weapon means makes for a finely tuned PVE combat experience that is much more immersive than the other Souls games... and you don't have any choice about it! You are forced to master these new mechanics, and quickly find yourself grappling around, sprinting, dodging, deflecting, and then destroying enemies and bosses that will leave your breathless with their magnificence. I could say more, but I don't want to spoil it for anyone. I implore you to not watch any videos of anyone else playing this game. No streams, no youtube, no reading about it. Just play the game. You just stumbled upon the greatest 1-player game of all time. Immerse yourself in it. Enjoy the experience.",10,2021-06-14,XBOX ONE,user

Razee1,"Sekiro is not a Souls game. This can't be stressed enough. Attempt to i-frame dodge through the game and you will get your ass slapped all the way back to Lordran. While it borrows certain elements from Souls, like the checkpoint system or cryptic NPC questlines, it's pretty much its own beast. And what a beast it is. It's one of those good news, bad news situations. Good news: the days when you needed to keep an eye on your stamina for every attack, block or dodge are over. Bad news: that doesn't mean the game is any less challenging. Quite the opposite, actually. Wolfie goes down in two hits tops, and at all times he's either heavily outnumbered or he gets crushed in the health bar measuring contest. And the absence of stats, gear and online co-op means there are no shortcuts. You won't be able to overlevel, no Solaire will come to your aid. It's either nut up or shut up. Luckily, there are ways to put you at a lesser disadvantage. Sekiro features a rudimentary stealth system and enough freedom to thin out your enemies' ranks one by one. Most of the times you can clear entire areas just by being sneaky. Apparently, Sekiro started out as a Tenchu game and I totally believe it, considering how far stealth will get you. But eventually a direct confrontation will be unavoidable. And where Souls games required you to only land that one parry, Sekiro demands that you time your blocks near perfectly several times per exchange. Combat is fast, fluid and demanding enough to make you break a sweat. While the areas are open and generally well-designed, they are not exactly eyecandy. Souls games are known for their sinister beauty, but that is largely absent in Sekiro. Some areas look flat-out rough. Only rarely will you get the urge to stop and soak in the atmosphere. A missed opportunity, really. And while the environments leave room for exploration, the absence of cool gear makes it feel strangely unrewarding. Also, due to the nature of combat you will see the same instakill moves and finishers quite often. A bit of variety would have been nice. Like the player, Sekiro faces its own set of challenges. Developer From Software has been around for over three decades, but only since the release of Demon's Souls the studio has gained a larger recognition in the West. Ever since, most of their games have been Souls games either directly or in spirit. Being widely known as the developer of Souls games came with the issue that they were expected to make nothing but Souls games - a curse, if you will. Sekiro marks the first time in a while that a major From Software title branches out far enough to be called its own thing - and be accepted by a large audience. With that leap of faith out of the way, it'll be exciting to see what they will come up with next.",10,2021-06-14,XBOX ONE,user

Evisicrator13,"After finally beating Sekiro I only feel one emotion, satisfaction. Satisfaction that I pushed through the odds and got ""gud."" This game isn't like a Souls game, in fact its nothing like it. If people say Dark Souls is hard, then Sekiro is unbeatable. After beating Sekiro it really put into perspective how ""easy"" the souls games are. People take for granted how many tools and assist's you get throughout the souls games, magic for being able to cheese bosses, buffs to speed up kills, leveling stats to close the gap, summoning help from other players. All of these tools to help you beat any obstacle thrown at you and people still call those games hard, I was one of them, but after beating Sekiro that has all changed. Sekiro rips away all of those tools to help you succeed and leaves you with only one thing, raw skill. The only way to beat Sekiro is to familiarize yourself with the mechanics and master them. No summons to help you fight the boss, no magic to cheese from far away, just your raw skill and determination. This game will push you to the limit, it will break you over and over again until you either push past your limits, or crumble from defeat. This game will make you relearn all over again how to play, in all honesty you'd be better off playing this game before any other souls games. If you're like me and so many others that have put hundreds of hours into the souls series then you will have an especially hard time with this game. All of those hours perfecting the mechanics and getting in the play-style of playing defensively, staying back and waiting will completely and utterly ruin you with this game. This game will force you to forget all of your previous knowledge and relearn everything. If you don't master the art of deflecting, counterattacking, and taking advantage of enemies you will not be able to finish this game. But once you do master those arts, oh my lord is it satisfying. Finally hitting that moment where you perfectly deflect a bosses entire chain and get the deathblow is one of the most satisfying things I have ever done in a video game. Getting to that point where you completely and utterly destroy a boss with perfect deflects and counterattacks will never cease to make me feel like a badass. This game is a master of making you feel like you are truly good at it, as well as making you feel like you are truly god awful at it. It will test your will, and if you pass, will make you feel like you can take on anything. It's hard, but try to not go into this game thinking its going to be another Dark Souls experience, because you will be sorely mistaken and frustrated. This is not Dark Souls, this is Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and if you don't come to terms with that then you will not enjoy this game. Great game over all though, and the combat is really satisfying, performance is good but not great, try it if you like being actually challenged and tested with all of your skill.",10,2021-05-14,XBOX ONE,user

24Kamspy,"I'd like to get this out there for people like me. I LOVE the Dark Souls series, but I was never any good with the parry. Straight sword and shield tank. Never even tried a parry outside of the Undead Burg I was so bad. Bloodborne wasn't even an option for me (could have been the 22fps). So I finally picked up Sekiro expecting to get demolished, but figured I'd finally try it out. I put it off for so long because I was told it's all about the parry, and I was terrible at Dark Souls parry. But guess what? It's waaay easier. Just the game as a whole. Not in a ""too easy"" way. It's still Dark Souls hard, but the parry system is much more forgiving and I'm actually pretty good at it. The moral of this long post is; if you **** at the parry in Dark Souls and are staying away from Sekiro because of it. Don't. It's awesome, and is completely different.",10,2021-05-14,XBOX ONE,user

Ardiffaz22,"Clashing of swords at its finest. It was a bit overwhelming in the very beginning for me (and I've never played a Souls game before) but after some time I got used to the flow. And when you get the rhythm, it becomes the dance. Fast-pacing engaging combat which requires your concentration and punishes you for your every mistake. It plays fair and teaches you to fight perfectly and if you learn your lesson it will be the most satisfying combat ever. Very fluid animations and clashing sounds which become the music. But katana is not your only weapon, you can use tons of tools fit into the prosthetic arm, both offensive and defensive. Or you can ignore them completely and only use your sword. It doesn't have the variety of customization like in an RPG, but what it has, it is made perfect. Yes, it's hard, it requires you to 'git gud', and you will die a lot and suffer. I had so much rage during some of the fights, yet I have never even considered a rage quit. The learning curve of the difficulty is quite balanced: once you start to feel comfy, it gives you another challenge. So you'll never get bored, even after beating the game: you can go for additional NG+ playthroughs and make the game harder (yes, harder). Just give up Kuro's charm and ring the demon bell ;D But besides the combat, this game has some more to offer. The stunning visuals of mountainous Japan, filled with gorgeous castles and temples, detailed armor of human warriors and fascinating creatures, which, as I suspect, are inspired by Japanese mythology. The game on the whole feels very Japanese, but it doesn't require you to know almost anything about their culture beforehand. The story is clear and quite linear, yet you can have 4 different endings. There are not so many characters, but each one of them has a story to tell. Plus some pieces of lore can be found in item descriptions and environment. If you pay attention the lore becomes more deep and complex. Easily one of the best (or even the best) game I've ever played. Well done, FromSoftware.",10,2021-05-14,XBOX ONE,user

Dom007,"As much as I love bloodborne and all other from software games I can't say the same with sekiro. I know they tried something different but this game feels inferior to every other game they've made. Whilst the game does indeed look beautiful and whilst the combat system is as always great. The level design is very linear. Usually I really like linear games but here it feels like just a bit too much. There are two branching paths/areas within the first few hours and it would have been far nicer to have had more of them. The customisation is dreadful. There are no armour sets, swords or weapons to be found in the levels which makes exploring them pointless. The mini bosses are far too frequent and lacking in quality. The fact there's hardly a levelling up system is not good. Not only does it limit the replay value immensely in terms of playing as different builds/classes (something the souls games undoubtably had) it also makes defeating bosses frustrating. There where so many times when I spent hours upon end on bosses only to have no fun or enjoyment whatsoever throughout the encounter. In the case of the souls games if you ever got stuck on a boss you could backtrack to level up or get better equipment or even visit another area. But in the case of sekiro From software just force you into a boss fight and say good luck. This game is no doubt one of the most unenjoyable games I've ever played and it's a shame considering how much I like From softwares previous games.",5,2021-02-13,XBOX ONE,user
cableguy3333,"You want me to what ? parry ? well that's new to me and I dont want to so I wont be playing anymore of this nonsense. Honestly I could give the game a 0 but as huge lover of the developer via the dark souls games I wont. I've completed ds3 and ds1 ng+2 and still counting and I've never parried anything, I tried it once in ds 3 got hit a couple of times to my 1 hit and decided that was dumb so I never did it again, I played using just a sword and no shield unless you count the grass one strapped to my back never to be removed but there you have it, melee you have 3 options, dodge, parry or block and also in my opinion order of effectiveness, Sekiro has one class and one option parry parry parry. So if you like to parry sure you will probably love it, but if parrying is boring to you then stear well clear you will be disappointed, also I find parrying such a ridiculous idea, sure against fellow humans but against giants and such are you having a laugh, i guarantee you parry anything from a giant your end up the other side of the country it's like a truck is driving right at you, do you a) jump out the way or b) try to deflect it with a piece of metal, I don't care how big the lump of metal is you are holding, you wont be holding it for long",5,2021-02-10,XBOX ONE,user

010101010100,"This game has great points and not so great points. I do not see the ""clunky"" controls in anyway. I found the combat to be very responsive and fun. Here's a tiny combat tip: If you swing, right before your sword passes your body, tap deflect, then tap attack again. The stronger base enemies deflect more than they block, so they will ""deflect"" your attack, but your block cuts the animation, so you can hit them while they are lowering their weapon from the deflect, and they can't do anything. The enemies are really strong in this game, but I've actually felt more in power with this game than I have in previous From games. The battles are fast-paced, but in no way does that mean the battles are short. In this game, base enemies take longer to kill than in other From games. The faster you make the battle, the more damage you're likely to take. It sounds counter-intuitive, but I've seen many players sacrificing health just to get a couple strikes on the enemy, just to realize that they didn't do as much damage as they thought they would, and now they have to use a healing item. I love the sheer mobility I have in this game, even without most martial arts skills (mid-air deflect & mid-air combat arts are musts imho). Even enemies in the last area of game (unless shura ending) go down with ease if you can time right (wait like 1/3-1/2 second between swings). I think it may be hard just because people have gotten used to DS3 and Bloodborne (in both games, whoever hits first can just continuously wail on the opponent without very much timing). I hate to say ""get good,"" but take this into account; If you're stuck, as impossible as the game may seem at the time, just think about how many people have gotten past that. it isn't impossible, but it is hard, and it is something to get used to. take your time, stay relaxed. You can get better. The only concerns are the repetitive bosses (there's a lot of bosses/minibosses in this game, it's not too unreasonable, and surprisingly doesn't feel out of place). My other concern is going to be lag. Toward the end of the game, you get to a point where there are a lot of enemies on the screen at a time. I only get lag when i'm surrounded by over 6 enemies and more than 4 opponents firing matchlock rifles/cannons/scattershots at the same time, but the lag is ""bad"". I put that in quotes because it looks horrible, but everything's in slow-mo, so the enemies eat **** lol. This game is also very different from other soulsborne games in the progression of your character. In previous games, you can grind, increase your stats and then beat the boss. However, in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, you have to defeat the boss in order to level up. This game is not played the way most people would think of game. You don't play sekiro because it's just fun running around and fighting some stuff. You play sekiro because you're a tryhard and a glutton for punishment. You want to beat the enemies as badly as they used to beat you. NG+ and you're a miniboss, probably won't even need a single healing item.",9,2020-05-06,XBOX ONE,user

Kingdim,"First, I wanna say that I beat the game, and played over 80 hours. I've done the longest end and beat all the mini boss. This game is great and had a phenomenal **** problem is that half of the time you will feel frustration in this game, essentially due to bad mechanics, camera, input delays, stuck in animation, counter intuitive things, bad controllers, camera delock during boss fight (one mistake you can die).... So this game is not for everybody; it's hard but the problem with the difficulty is that there is another one added : articficial difficulty. Umbalance boss, crazy learning curve and a GIGANTIC gap between exploration phases (very easy..) and bosses. When I finished the game I was released, not happy. I tried again in NG+, but even if I'm playing much better, I am still always frustrated with the same things. in summary : + POSITIVE -great musics -great landscapes -nice moves in the exploration phases -steath mecanic - NEGATIVE -odd camera -deflecting system too hazardous -gameplay not clear -input delay -you have to be fast and lots of time you will be stuck in animations -somes bosses are overpowered -Last boos, not chekpoint after Genichiro (you have to beat him all over again, it's just annoying, beleive me) -artificial difficulty (overpower bosses) -tiny space for some bosses, it's a nightmare (camera, you see nothing, you don't know what is going one etc ..) -when you die you 'll lose half of your exeperience HALF, unless the decease is not there, but even in this case you just have 30% chance to save it, half of your money etc ...

Asnow30,"After playing the amazing Dark Souls 3, I was waiting for this Sekiro more than another game in this year. And it hasn¬¥t disappointed me. This game is the next step in From Software company, reinventing the sucessful mechanics of the previous titles, creating a more dinamic, faster and terribly difficult masterpiece. Talking about the difficulty, I disagree with the people who isn't able to beat the first or the second boss and claim in Twitter, Youtube or any social network that Sekiro must have an easy mode. This game requires you time and pacience to learn the movements of the enemies and improve your attacks if you want to beat all of them. But, the rewards of achieve it is indescribable and takes me to my childhood, when I spent lots of hours trying to win an exigent battle in any old game. GOTY 2019?

MrHugonautilus,"Shinobi, Ninjas, Jutsus, japanische Tempelanlagen‚Ä¶ geht‚Äôs noch besser? ‚ÄûSekiro: Shadows Die Twice‚Äú macht vieles richtig richtig gut. Das Game sieht klasse aus (ich spiele es auf der Xbox One X), hat ein schnelles und knackiges Gameplay, bockschwere Bosse ‚Äì aber auch ein Belohnungssystem, was mich befriedigt. Doch nicht ganz so schnell‚Ä¶ K√ÑMPFEN WIE EIN NINJA Unser einarmiger Held startet nicht ganz so einarmig und verliert in einer Keilerei mit einem Samurai seinen Arm. Fortan ist es ihm jedoch m√∂glich, Shinobi-Prothesen zu nutzen, die n√ºtzliche Gadgets mit sich bringen. Zu Beginn kann man Wurfsterne werfen, kleine Feuerwerke z√ºnden oder eine Axt gegen feindliche Schilde schwingen. Es gibt eine ganze Reihe dieser Prothesen, die man im Laufe des Spiels findet. F√ºr viele Bosse sind die richtigen Prothesen essenziell, um sie zu besiegen (geht auch ohne ‚Äì ist aber ekelhaft schwer). Anders als in den Dark Souls Teilen, versucht man in ‚ÄûSekiro: Shadows Die Twice‚Äú die Haltung des Gegners soweit zu bearbeiten, dass man ihn mit Finisher-Moves richtig eins √ºber die R√ºbe geben kann. Meine gute alte Taktik (in Dark Souls) es mit Riesenschild und Streitkolben erstmal ruhig angehen zu lassen, ist in ‚ÄûSekiro: Shadows Die Twice‚Äú v√∂llig fehl am Platze bzw. nicht m√∂glich. Angriff ist hier die beste Verteidigung und das Gameplay m√∂chte perfektioniert werden. Wer die unterschiedlichen Konterm√∂glichkeiten drauf hat, braucht sich vor keinem Gegner mehr zu f√ºrchten. Einen Punkt, den ich in ‚ÄûSekiro: Shadows Die Twice‚Äú jedoch schmerzlich vermisse, ist das Gearfarming bzw. die Ausr√ºstung an sich. In den Souls-Teilen fand ich genau das total genial, f√ºr jeden Gegnertypen eine andere Waffe nutzen zu k√∂nnen, oder aber meine Ausr√ºstung ab√§ndern zu k√∂nnen (schwere R√ºstung ‚Äì leichte R√ºstung, usw.). Das gibt es schlicht in ‚ÄûSekiro: Shadows Die Twice‚Äú nicht. Auch ein Charakter-Level-System, wie in den Souls-Teilen, ist nicht vorhanden. Man sammelt sehr wohl eine Art ‚ÄúErfahrungspunkte‚Äù und kann dann verschiedenste F√§higkeiten freischalten, aber man levelt nicht direkt den Charakter um st√§rker zu werden. Gameplay ist hier einfach alles! In den Dark-Souls-Teilen kann man sich wunderbar hinter gutem Equip verstecken, wohingegen der einarmige Wolf perfekte Konter- oder Parieraktionen ben√∂tigt. DAS FAZIT ‚Äì GELUNGEN? Unabh√§ngig der fehlenden Ausr√ºstung und der ver√§nderten Charakterentwicklung ist ‚ÄûSekiro: Shadows Die Twice‚Äú ein √ºberragendes Spiel. In Sachen Level- und Bossdesign (mittelalterliches Japan, berittene Samurai, Riesenschlangen usw.), Atmosph√§re (d√ºstere Stimmung und MEGA Soundtrack) und Gameplay (schnell, aggressiv und reaktionsgeladen) legt ‚ÄûFrom Software‚Äú nochmal einen **** Batzen zu und setzt neue Ma√üst√§be. F√ºr Casual-Gamer, die ein Game √° la ‚ÄûAssassins Creed‚Äú erwarten, wird ‚ÄûSekiro: Shadows Die Twice‚Äú definitiv viel zu schwer sein. Man sollte sich bewusst sein, dass es eine hohe Frustationsgrenze braucht, um nicht den ein oder anderen Controller gegen die Wand zu schmettern. Doch wenn der Boss nach dem Xten-Mal dann doch down geht ‚Äì das Gef√ºhl ist einfach klasse! KAUFEN!!!",10,2019-06-03,XBOX ONE,user
tobemayr,"By removing most tactical options concerning armament and character build, the main focus is on the attack-and-deflect combat. The stealth element similar to From Software's previous Tenchuu series makes a weak comeback, and the action/sword combat doesn't have much room for personal expression. Level artwork and setting is atmospheric, storytelling interesting. Overall, a lot of impact is sacrificed at the cost of high replay and practice demand.",7,2019-05-22,XBOX ONE,user
theonlyone21,amazing game story action and gameplay it doesnt deserve hate from salty dark souls bloodborne fans just enjoy it its fun and has cool skills and upgrades that you can use,10,2019-05-18,XBOX ONE,user
Exfan,"First of all game is good studio sadly is published by Activision. Perhaps this is clear sign that it did not make cut to be released by From Software. If you compare this to dark Souls series you will be let down it has sloppy graphics visually game is not impressive, story is little bit too meh that is because lack of character development or ways to play. Combat system is boring as hell same button smashing and with perfect timing you can insta kill opponent Game is just too linear offering really no other way to advance in plot. Bosses are those blockers every one has least 2 stages because you need to either chip away stance or chip away health. You just button smash basic attack any special attacks seem to be useless. Stealth is also option but only for trash mobs bosses you need chip away other health bar/stance. You could say this is just once time experience after playing while it just gathers dust in your game library. Then question it is hard yea i would say but then you could also say if you got extra time to spend playing and do not mind practicing everything is possible. Only question i could say could you use that time better games that actually reward your progress and have multiple ways to finish game. Character stats are just useless most of bosses just 1 shot you anyway so get good or die trying. Game is action game with steep learning curve, challenging, once a life **** time sink.

It requires a lot of thinking on your feet and lateral thinking as it does not hold your hand at all, especially with the game progression, as crucial items and sections can be easily missed. I would give it an 8 out of 10 but my score will sit at a 10 to weigh out the low scores. Just because you are bad at the game doesn't mean that it is a bad game itself.

UncleBusty,"This was my first entry into the Soulborne series as I am fascinated with samurai and ninja and have heard from friends such good things about the soulborne series but I never tried any of them due to opinions of other friends calling them ""only for masochists"". Boy, were they ever so wrong. This game gave me a completely different understanding to the phrase ""Git GuD"". I found myself grinding for an hour on one boss only to have it finally ""click"" in my head and earn a very satisfying shinobi execution. There was no denying. I earned this. This game thoroughly rewards players that stick with it and learn the controls with shinobi arts and prosthetic arts, flashy skills to use mid-combat. These DO NOT make the enemies easier to kill however. Your skill as a player is the only thing that tips the scales in combat. The story is also excellent. It ""really makes you feel"" like a samurai that is slowly turning into shinobi. In conclusion, think about Sekiro as art. Wolf is your paintbrush, the skills are your colors, and the enemies are your canvas.",10,2019-05-03,XBOX ONE,user

nikigoturspine,"Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is an action adventure game that has a strong focus on precision timing combat. In the game you play as a shinobi who must sneak, kill, and run through areas filled with a pretty good variety of enemies and lands that are all beautiful in design and enjoyable in combat. However, calling your character a ninja is kind of a bit of a misnomer, because the game really encourages you to fight head on head and engage in duels, and often disregards its own stealth and tool mechanics for the sake of it. This is because that for many of the stronger enemies and all of the bosses, the best and most efficient way to fight is by fighting them directly and focus on parrying. The entire game revolves around the parry mechanic, and while that is fine and dandy, it does quickly create a dissonance between story and game. This dissonance is pervasive, as the story and mechanics never feel connected, as you are told one thing and proceed in a completely different fashion, which really mars what would otherwise be an absolutely excellent game. in addition, a lot of the characters, plot, and the world have a similar dissonance. (MINOR SPOILER AHEAD) One important side character you meet, (not saying her name so to avoid spoiling too much) one that really you are expected to feel connected to due to how useful she is in the game, will tell you, if you do what is necessary, that she has an affinity for monkeys and has a strong connection to them due to an experience she had when young. Yet if you fight her in one of the endings she fights pretty much like a standard samurai, not like her character would suggest, in a wild monkey like fashion, or through any way that reflects her character. Many figures in the game have this issue, while not all, those that do bother me, and yet again create a dissonance just continues to pervade the game's world. Regardless of how the story and characters don't connect with the game play I find the game to be very enjoyable for anyone looking for a challenging plot driven game that focuses on raw skill and precision over all else, and while the world and story are not as strong as Bloodborne, another fromsoft title, it is definitely a quality piece of entertainment. If you want a new challenge then pick up this unique title today.",8,2019-05-01,XBOX ONE,user

Nataraja,"First and foremost, this is not a game for everyone. This is a game that, more so than other FromSoftware titles, requires you to learn. There are multiple approaches to everything but assuming that the tactics of old will work here will frustrate you. With that said Sekiro is a visual wonder. The environments, mobs, player character and NPCs are amazing works of art. The sense of exploration is very palpable and strongly rewarded. The story is much more straight forward with huge amounts of depth hidden in subtle ways. This is a different way of story telling for this developer and I believe that it is still very effective, with plenty to research and get out of nuances, yet everyone who plays will understand the surface of the story which has not been true for other games with the exception of the exceptional VR game Derracine. Sound is very well done - great music appropriately fit to the games moment to moment action. The Japanese voice acting is impeccable but the English voice over work is, frankly, awful. If you can handle reading subtitles I would strongly suggest it. The English voice work is so bad as to be totally breaking of any immersion you may have in the game. Sound effects and source to reception is very well done. Combat gameplay is unique and very well implemented. It requires the player to develop some baseline skills and once you have it down it becomes thrilling and rewarding to enter combat. Stealth is enjoyable but a bit wonky in places, yet there is no requirement to use stealth, but the game becomes much more difficult if you don't use it. Stealth can change the game significantly as charging head first into areas usually ends up with your death in short order. Sekiro is an unforgiving game. There is a certain baseline of skill acquisition that is expected of the player. If you don't enjoy precision requiring games and prefer button mashing, this will not be the game for you. If you love what FromSoft does, then this is a game you absolutely should play.",9,2019-04-26,XBOX ONE,user
luxton,"Sekiro: Shadows die twice is an amazing game from FromSoftware. Anyone familiar with ‚Äúsoulsbourne‚Äù games will know exactly what to expect, brutality difficult combat, cryptic story, unique art design which isn‚Äôt technically groundbreaking, but still looks fantastic, and obscure mechanics. So what‚Äôs different? One of the biggest differences is that there isn‚Äôt much in the way of customization, no weapon types, only a katana, but you will have access to additional sub weapons known as prosthetics that range from projectiles to a defensive umbrella! All prosthetics have a purpose, although at first some of them might seem ineffective but you‚Äôll soon discover their potential, usually by eavesdropping and reading scrolls for information. The story is more streamlined, simple and not as cryptic as other ‚Äúsoulsbourne‚Äù games, but this not a bad thing, the emphasis in this game is combat! And it‚Äôs so satisfying once you get used to it, and the boss fights are some of the most epic I‚Äôve ever experienced in a game. And if you can persevere without the aid of the internet then you‚Äôll likely experience the most rewarding victories a game can offer! I personally score this game a 9 out of 10, reason being is I wasn‚Äôt particularly keen on the dying mechanic, in ‚Äúsoulsbourne‚Äù games the player has one chance to reclaim their ‚Äúsouls‚Äù or EXP after death, if you die while trying to backtrack to your corpse you‚Äôll lose all EXP. In Sekiro, you‚Äôll have 1 life per run, that is if you die you can immediately resurrect, however if you die a second time you‚Äôll likely lose a large amount of EXP and money, there is a 30% that you won‚Äôt but this percentage does lower the more you die, also NPC will get sick, closing potentially side quests, this penalty can be remedied with an item though. The problem, I found at least, is that this system encourages too much grinding, mini bosses and bosses will certainly kill you, many times, and I found myself on many occasions in areas where there were mini bosses or clearly a boss, and in most cases it is foolish to tackle a boss while possessing a large amount of EXP and money so the most logical thing to do is to spend EXP and money before taking on bosses, but, you might not always have enough EXP to buy skills so it‚Äôs best to go and grind until you have enough EXP to buy something. The 30% chance of not losing anything upon death means nothing when considering the amount of times you will die tackling bosses. Apart from that complaint this game is near flawless! Difficult though, so if you don‚Äôt particularly like hard games then Sekiro might not be for you, but if you enjoy a challenge then I totally recommend this game!",9,2019-04-25,XBOX ONE,user

Fighting the same boss over, and over? Welcome to From Software. No armor? YOU'RE A NINJA! Not as fun as Dark Souls? F**k off, It's not Dark Souls. From Software was trying to tell a nonRPG style game for once, while still retaining the rage levels of difficulty, and i appreciate that.

Most people have spent $60 for less than a few hours of play before it gets unbearably hard and repetitive as you attempt the same boss over and over and over again. EDIT - On the XBOX one X - there is a approximately a .1ms delay between pressing a button on the controller and the action happening in Sekiro. This is far too slow to even have a fair crack at some bosses such as the Ashina elite. If you simply stare at him for the QUE to press, too slow every time. It's totally broken and a huge oversight. Piece of **** game. It's sad really. I'm at the 5th boss and it's boring doing the same fight 30 times. Hard does not mean well designed at all... it's a lazy way to squeeze more out ****.

I found the difficulty annoying in this game, certain enemies very frustrating, and overall this is a serious case of get annoyed or get gud. I was of the latter camp and therefore have personally wasted my money, I gave the game 11 hours and reached madam butterfly before deciding I just wasn't really having fun and if I'm not enjoying an experience it's an experience best ignored.

Just ONE weapon with ONE light attack, no stats, no armors, prosthetic arm with so-so ""tools"" and non-imaginative skill trees. Skills are described via pictures (lol - you don't know what you exactly get and you cannot respec - it's 2019 FromS!

volkermuller55,"Say goodbye to armor, primary weapons, varied and complex builds, emotes and any other roleplaying elements, coop, and pvp. This is not a soulsborne game and fans of the soulsborne franchises should not be misled into believing that the gameplay is similar. Virtually every system has been overhauled, for better or worse. In some ways this title is more friendly to new players than previous ones because you'll never have to look at wall of stats that you'd have to dig around online to make sense of and you won't have the training scars from playing earlier titles. But in another way, it's much more hostile to new players because the difficulty scaling is unprecedented even for a From Software game. Grinding is mostly ineffectual as the only reward you get for grinding is Sen (the primary currency, which can be used to purchase consumables and in some cases prosthetic attachments) and Skill Points, which are used to purchase new acrobatic abilities for your character (only one of which can be slotted at a time). You cannot increase your HP pool or Posture by grinding and you cannot summon friendly NPCs to assist you in boss fights, meaning that when you get stuck on a boss your only option is to continue slamming your head against that wall until you win or quit the game. Many returning FromSoft fans that are hostile to new players, casuals, and the notion of accessibility in game design will see these changes as improvements, however I generally see them as a step backwards. I don't think it's good game design for the basic narrative elements to be inaccessible to many players (even some who are willing to spend countless hours trying to 'git gud'). My single biggest complaint with the game is the reductive nature of the new combat system. Many players seem to feel that the combat system is more complex than ever, but I disagree and I will enumerate my reasons why: Poise has been all but removed from the game, weapon arts have been replaced by acrobatic skills, stamina management was replaced by posture, spirit emblems effectively replaced FP, the prosthetic replaced spell attunement, and the jump mechanic replaced the kick. The vast array of sorceries, miracles, and pyromancies (96 total in dark souls 3) have been replaced by 11 prosthetic attachments. In Dark Souls or Bloodborne there are a wide variety of different play styles and approaches that are equally viable for completing the PVE content. You can be a strong dude with heavy armor, a giant, slow weapon, and tons of poise that just knocks bosses on their asses and manages damage trades. You can use spellcasting as your primary strategy for virtually every boss in the game. You can use a dex character with high mobility and fast weapons that inflict status effects like bleed on enemies. They all do the job, and this fantastic variety makes for excellent replay value (even for the players that aren't interested in challenge runs). That's just not the case in Sekiro. You have one weapon, one basic play style, and bosses only have one or sometimes two different basic strategies that are viable to beat them. To make things worse, many of the acrobatic skills that can be acquired that are supposed to make the player feel like they're making progress and getting deeper gameplay are completely nullified by certain bosses. For example, unblockable thrust weapon attacks and some kicks can be countered with a skill called the mikiri counter and unblockable sweep attacks can be jumped over, followed by a swift kick to the face that deals a lot of posture damage. Certain bosses, like Genichiro Ashina (a required boss for story progression), for example, can completely nullify these abilities and punish the player for trying to take advantage of them. This removes depth from the combat and this tactic the developers use to increase the difficulty of the game is equally artificial as tactics like making a boss' attacks deal so much damage they're all one-shot kills or tripling the HP pool of the boss to make it harder. It certainly feels like the central principal of this game's design was to make it extremely difficult without regard for making the gameplay feel fair, varied, or balanced. These drawbacks are such an intrusive impediment to enjoying the game that they overshadow many pleasant qualities in the game. I like that they tried to challenge returning hardcore players by removing I-frames from dodges. I like the new grappling mechanic and how this frees up the artists who designed the maps to add an entirely new dimension to the areas you play in. The visuals and voice acting are superb, and there appears to be just as much effort put into developing the lore of this game universe as previous titles. There are tons of different boss fights to be had in this game with 15 bosses and 29 Mini-bosses, although some of them are effectively just re-skins. I love FromSoft and their games, but I think this one was simply a step in the wrong direction. 6/10",6,2019-03-29,XBOX ONE,user

Stoys,"This game for me is a huge dissapointment: And not because its not a souls game, but because it lacks what would make this game more fun. If this was a remake or an old game in general it would be a 8/10 cause back then we did not know any better. But in 2019 this is not good enough. The Combat get so repetetive and boring, and even as a souls fan and From Software is my all time favorite developer, i appreciate a difficult game and a rewarding game. This in my opinion lacks the rewarding part. I struggled hard with 2 bosses, and becuase i grew tierd of the mechanics, and that you have alternate paths (wich i normally love) i feel that sometimes you need items to complete a fight, (like the axe for breaking a normal enemy shield) wich i missed. So when i saw the strat video i was so dissapointed on how you kill them, there is only 2 strats for every boss. either defence them tierd or offence the tierd and done! its still hard. but not fun. No stat system, no lvl system, no gear, no primary weapons, no customization, no outfits. same katana in the hole game. shinobi has some new stuff and upgrade ability. but that system is not fun when you only use them for small things. changing a primary weapon will change the whole playstyle of the game, wich would make this game sooo much better. cause then you have vierity. I am so sick of seeing the deathblow. Story i feel actually is kinda good, its a little bit back and forth but i like it. I dont like the graphics in the game, the colors and everything does not look 2019. I get they are going for that old feeling, and back to their roots. But im not impressed. What bugs me the most is the good feedback they are getting. cause normal people have alot of bad to say about this game. and its still a 9/10 all over the board! and i never saw people complaining this way about god of war. and it has better score. but god of war should have 18/10 compared to this game! (im not comparing them, im just saying) From software does NOT have a huge fanbase cause their game is soo different and hard, But they have their best and most dedicated fan base. and i think they should listen to us. They did not have to do alot to make this game a 9/10 for me. its just those things that i feel is missing, breaks the entire game into something thats repetetive, boring after 5 hours and what i feel is not rewarding! even though i get new stuff, i just feel thats a progress i need to complete the game. its not a holy **** this is cool factor! anyway i hope people like it in a way cause from needs support to make their next games. but i dont wanna encourage this game making behavior that happend with sekiro!",4,2019-03-25,XBOX ONE,user
AwfulThings,"Imagine Dark Souls meets Shadows of Mordor. That's essentially what you have here. There is a HUGE emphasis on one-shot kills in Sekiro. Whether it be stealth based or just out smarting your opponents to get those satisfactory kills. Everything about this game makes me appreciate older itterations of the SoulsBourne series more. Unlike the previous titles, this game will KILL you. In Souls I always thought starting with 5 flasks wasnt enough for healing. Boy, do I wish I had 5 damn flasks this time around. You start with 1. This game teaches you to play smarter more or less and how to time attacks. The boss design is among the best in the series (personally Bloodborne has the best design imo). Especially with the new ""death mark"" in any fight, it makes any encounter truly terrifying. You now know when a boss will one shot you and it adds for an all new level of infuriating gameplay. We all know these games are hard, they're not for the lighthearted. But goddamn, the feeling you get for finally overcoming a boss you've been stuck on for hours is the best feeling in the world. You push on to the next area (get immediately destroyed) and keep pushing on.

Stinger2900,The game feels like a souls game from the very beginning however there are many differences although people who are familiar with the soul series can jump in relatively easily . While most people would see The fact that you play as a preset character and only have one weapon throughout the game as a negative however this is a positive such as you would want to master a specific weapon instead of switching out on the fly. The combat is fast paced and that seems a lot more simpler than the previous outings from from software And the fact that there's an actual story this time is appreciated and the environmental storytelling is still there from the soul series which is greatly appreciated that they can do both. Boss fights are difficult as usual and you will die a lot of course as you would expect. As a person who would want to start in the series of souls born games I Think Sekiro Is an amazing point to start and is amazing game to boot. The graphics look great especially on the xbox 1X however there are some muddy textures here and there and on the 1080P television it looks great So it doesn't really matter what you play on its going to look great. I definitely commend fromsoftware for this great achievement in design and combat in video games.,10,2019-03-23,XBOX ONE,user

sthxdnn,"First of all, let's get this out of the way: Sekiro does a terrible job of teaching you its new skills and complex inventory. You will need to backtrack to the very small and questionable hub often to upgrade prosthetics without really being told so. If you get past the milestone of understanding how the game works, everything starts to get much less frustrating and starts to feel fair. I spent over an hour becoming infuriated with every enemy with bows until I realized my shuriken melted their health; then I felt even more strongly against shields until I found a prosthetic skill that practically one-shots these enemies. I see a lot of soulsborne fanatics like myself hating on the game and I have to assume they were where I was. If you play this game without walkthroughs as I insisted, you are going to have your time cut out for you. However, I strongly recommend you don't do this if you aren't a FromSoft fanboy with masochistic tendencies like I am. Also, be warned that a gung ho approach like I did in DS3 and Bloodborne is not really as viable here. It simply feels much harder than other entries and not like the typical getting used to a game. There are more enemies, they kill you very fast, and the combat is incredibly complex when you aren't thrown into one build. Another great new mechanic is the emphasis on stealth. Although this felt very exploitable because you can stealth kill an enemy and run away, then just come back and do it again (even on ""mini-bosses,"" however, you cannot finish them off this way). Combat is very tactical and deflecting (parrying) and guarding are at least as necessary as striking as dodging is not made available at the start (cannot confirm if available at all). Enemies are nearly impossible to single out; like Bloodborne, but much worse. My biggest gripe is that traversal doesn't feel as good as it could. Jumping up ledges is clunky and some ledges are impossible to vault up simply because the ledge wasn't designed that way even though it's the same height as similar cliffs. I demoed this on PC, but plan on supporting it through Xbox One X when I have the money. The game defaults Japanese on you and while I love playing Japanese games like this, like Yakuza, I found it to be too fast for my reading skills. The English dub sounds great as it stands, but not in comparison to the Japanese. This is a visually striking game and without the old overused engine, becomes very impressive and refreshing. I wouldn't recommend waiting on a sale if you are on the fence about it; just get it and expect it to be different in a good way.",9,2019-03-23,XBOX ONE,user

Xbox_Alive,"Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is a stylish stealth/action adventure that, emphasizes precision and skill based combat. It doesn‚Äôt require full on stealth while still allowing it, and includes break-neck melee combat against threats of massive proportions with a heightened excitement of a new IP. It‚Äôs sincerely imaginative and supports a focused experience that down sizes some of From Software‚Äôs previous senses without losing its new feel and mystery. Sekiro is an amazing new twist on a familiar set of ideas that can stand on its own alongside its predecessors. From the moment I began the game I knew I was in for a AAA giant game that was definitely in the running for Game Of The Year. Sekiro is a truly new expression of the designs philosophy that FromSoftware has spent years refining. Mega-Fans will rejoice in every second of tense combat, rich environments, challenging and puzzle based boss battling, and stealth-killing enemies to glory. This is a boss-battle focused game with a target lock-on and is pretty much ninja gaming perfection. If you‚Äôre into 50-60 hours of intense story telling and over the top balanced gaming, then you have found it. If you haven‚Äôt bought this game yet. Why?

Le grappin, le double saut, l'absence d'endurance... c'est un vrai rafra√Æchissement compar√© aux Souls. Un autre gros changement, qui fait toute la diff√©rence, c'est l'absence de comp√©tences et de changement d'√©quipement.

takanashii,"""Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice"" to gra, kt√≥ra wzbudza mieszane uczucia. FromSoftware jest znane z tworzenia wymagajƒÖcych tytu≈Ç√≥w, a ""Sekiro"" nie jest wyjƒÖtkiem. Jednak w przeciwie≈Ñstwie do serii ""Dark Souls"" czy ""Bloodborne"", ta gra skupia siƒô bardziej na szybkiej i precyzyjnej walce, co jest jednocze≈õnie jej najwiƒôkszƒÖ zaletƒÖ i wadƒÖ.Zalety:Unikalny system walki: ""Sekiro"" wprowadza zupe≈Çnie nowy system walki, kt√≥ry jest bardziej oparty na parowaniu cios√≥w i kontratakach ni≈º na unikaniach i blokowaniu. Jest to ≈õwietne od≈õwie≈ºenie, kt√≥re wymaga od gracza opanowania precyzji i refleksu.Atmosfera i ≈õwiat: Gra osadzona jest w fantastycznej wersji feudalnej Japonii, kt√≥ra jest nie tylko piƒôknie zaprojektowana, ale r√≥wnie≈º pe≈Çna tajemnic i niebezpiecze≈Ñstw. Klimat tej gry jest niepowtarzalny, a styl graficzny idealnie oddaje surowo≈õƒá i piƒôkno epoki samuraj√≥w.Wyzwanie: ""Sekiro"" nie oszczƒôdza gracza. Ka≈ºdy boss i mini-boss to powa≈ºne wyzwanie, kt√≥re wymaga cierpliwo≈õci i precyzji. Dla wielu to bƒôdzie plus, bo satysfakcja z pokonania trudnego przeciwnika jest ogromna.Wady:Brak r√≥≈ºnorodno≈õci w stylu gry: W przeciwie≈Ñstwie do wcze≈õniejszych gier FromSoftware, ""Sekiro"" mocno ogranicza r√≥≈ºnorodno≈õƒá w podej≈õciu do rozgrywki. Nie ma tutaj klas postaci, magii ani mo≈ºliwo≈õci rozwoju w r√≥≈ºnych kierunkach. Gra wymaga od gracza opanowania jednego, konkretnego stylu walki, co mo≈ºe byƒá frustrujƒÖce dla os√≥b, kt√≥re ceniƒÖ sobie wiƒôkszƒÖ swobodƒô w RPG.Fabu≈Ça: Choƒá ≈õwiat jest interesujƒÖcy, fabu≈Ça jest opowiedziana w spos√≥b do≈õƒá oszczƒôdny.

Devitz,"Was thinking about 6, but lets take into consideration all the things that game does wrong: - 0 build variety, thats it. Everyone just mashes the katana, prostetic tools are either OP in certain fights(eg. umbrellas) or, in most cases, completly useless and a waste of symbols. - connected to the above, but you will wear exactly the same sword and exactly the same armor(i mean, there is no armor, there is customization whatsoever) from the 1st to last minute of your gameplay - The story is simple, boring and in game only to have any incentive to push player forward. - Again, NPC quests are unfun, unrewarding and without hesitation - SKIP THEM. Basically the worst side quests system in any game you will ever play(didn't learn a thing from DS3) - music is mediocre at best and in many cases just bland and boring - THE REPETITIVENESS of mini bosses is simply disgraceful, but to also repeat 3 of the main bosses?! Then cut the game price, because most of us pay exactly for that part of your game - epic boss fights. If you ever consider buying this game, never for a full price. - game has 2 very well done zones(and one of them is the last one that, if player chooses the wrong dialogue option, will be completly skipped) - compared to Dark Souls 3 there is basically no variety of trash mobs, again laziness, game not worth the price they're asking for it - pointless mechanics like dragonrot(additional punishment for dying, like game is double kicking you in the ballsack) and unseen aid(pure downgrade from a simple but original and working souls system BASED ON RNG) - hidden boss phases, that was made with pure intention to iritate the players On the plus side: - original and challenging combat system where player actually feels like learning and making progress, even vs simple trash mobs AND REPETITIVE mini bosses. - unique japaneese atmosphere, no need to even check where is the FromSoftware studio from. In this aspect game made with love - game gives more freedom of movement than old souls games, especially vertically thanks to the grappling hook, very satisfying to use - takes very little disc space, did not encounter any technical difficulties, can be run on very old setups - it's hard, but you need to accept death as a learning process and boss mechanics that are meant to make you angry. But if you're into souls-likes, then i consider it a plus - overall combat sounds and animations are juicy, powerful and on point.

Easily has the best combat mechanics out of any game, very punishing at the start however once learned it feels so exhilarating to engage with enemies. The level design is also just amazing, with you revisiting areas and them changing alongside your play through and however far you are in the story. Not to mention Fountainhead Palace and Senpou temple are easily top 5 best visually looking areas out of any fromsoftware game. Not to mention Ashina castle well might be a perfect level with it being compact but being a perfect almost middle level and you can traverse other levels from just exploring Ashina castle. Not to mention revisiting it you can see how it changes with the things that take place in the story and overall just really cool to see, and just feels super immersive. As I said it has the strongest lineup of bosses out of any fromsoft game and the finale is definitely a highlight. One of the toughest bosses out of any game however it plays so well and no death seems undeserved. Not to mention the spectacle of the fight is just unmatched, easily the best fromsoft boss of all time and it‚Äôs really not close in my opinion.

The game excels in delivering solid visuals, a compelling musical score, and an immersive ambiance.

Zski,"To start with my history with Souls games. I never liked any of them, at all, until Elden Ring, which I absolutely loved. I read that the next most accessible game is Sekiro, so after my great experience with Elden Ring, I decided to give this one a shot.I‚Äôll start with the positives. The story/lore is a bit confusing but highly intriguing. Since I now understand how the story works in these games, I can appreciate what is being presented, especially since it‚Äôs a bit more active story telling compared to Elden Ring. The way they weave the story and lore into the atmosphere of the game is excellent, which really plays into the overall presentation of the setting. The graphics are very good, although nothing memorable. Mix that with a soundtrack that does the job exceptionally well despite not being memorable in any way, and it‚Äôs a great feeling **** issue, as it always was with Souls games, is the combat. I‚Äôm still having the same experience I always had with these games where I feel that the control of the character is just too loose. The slightest movement of the stick makes your character completely pivot all over the place, luckily the lock on mechanic makes it feel a little more grounded, but I hate to say it, the control of the character feels cheap. It almost feels dated, like a PS2 era game. I thought the hookshot and the prosthetic weapons work well and really enhance maneuverability compared to other games I played, but when that‚Äôs combined with the floaty controls, it feels like you have no weight in any of your actions. So I have mixed feelings about it - the maneuverability makes it feel more action based, which ironically sets up the stealth, but the way you‚Äôre forced to use it makes it lame. Maybe I‚Äôm not understanding, but the 1 on 1 fights are fun, it can be fun learning the patterns. Despite dying over and over, those segments were fun enough to give me that feeling where I knew what I did wrong, and immediately go into trying the fight again. But when there are more than one enemy present, the combat completely falls apart. It just feels like you back up a little, isolate an enemy and damage them a little bit until the group catches up, back up a little, isolate an enemy, then rinse wash and repeat.After about 6 hours with the game, I find that it‚Äôs time for me to put the game down. It has its moments, but I find that I spend a lot of mental energy convincing myself that it‚Äôs not that bad. If I spend most of my time with a game convincing myself that I‚Äôm having fun, it‚Äôs not really that fun. I can see how people enjoy it, but it‚Äôs just not for me. I gave it my best, and the weird loose grip of the character and floaty movement combined with decent combat made it hard to feel like I care enough to go on.",6,2023-10-11,PC,user

Avey123Avey,"What makes Sekiro my favourite FromSoft game is the more condencsed focus in the combat system. Gone are the RPG mechanics and hundreds of equipment pieces. Instead the game aims to create a superior battle system that still plays to the FromSoft trope of memorizing opponets movements and timings. In most fromsoft games the combat feels very turnbased. You wait for the enemy to complete their strings of attacks and when an opening occurs you make an attack. Even with all of the builds and options most players ultimately fall into this same motion. Sekiro is very much the same however instead of your only defensive option being to dodge roll and block, this game adds a whole host of engaging defensive options. Enemies can have seemingly endless strings and still be a blast to engage with due to how much more fun the combat system is for this kind of gameplay. Additionally this game makes mastering its combat system feel so much more rewarding and satisfying with the constant feedback you are given in combat, each succesful parry brings you closer to victory in a way dodge rolls simply don't. That being said there are some elements of this game that feel as though they are fairly halfbaked. The dragonrot and death system as a whole is pretty meaningless, and the means by which you engage with it are far less meaningful. The soul recovery system in dark souls actually tangibly effects your moment-to-moment descision making, where I feel its easy to forget you lose anything in Sekiro for dying due to the skill tree barely mattering. I feel the game may have been better suited by simply stripping out all rpg mechanics. Overall this is a brillant action game that may disappoint fans expecting something like darks souls. If the part you liked about previous Fromsoft games was the rpg elements and the build theorycrafting, Sekiro may not be for you. If on the other hand you liked mastering enemy strings and tough boss encounters then I cannot reccomend this game strongly enough.",9,2023-08-28,PC,user

By far the most beautiful and colourful world they managed to create (and I played this _after_ Elden Ring), although comparatively to their latest opus magnum, it is certainly small and compact.

Jonny123,"For me this is the worst From Soft title. Still a great game but I didn't enjoy it enough. My main problem with this kind of game was the reactive gameplay that can be repetitive. But I think I might need to play it again at some point and be more aggressive so the problem might be on the user end. My first thought were that this game has quite a few strong points but overall it feels and plays like a lot of work and even when doing good I hardly enjoyed playing it (despite feeling a sense of addiction - in a bad way). Let's start with the strongest points: - solid graphics that really fit the setting - very smooth controls and motion - grappling hook and stealth aspects are fun - interesting posture / swordfighting mechanics - some encounters are quite remarkable (for example the giant ape) I can accept a game being a challenge and forcing you to take it serious. The problem is that too much things related to gameplay in this game feels like it was made to be as annoying as possible on purpose - and is also quite repetitive because the game is forcing you to play in a certain way and do it all over again too many times. Also the game is lacking a lot of basic modern gaming features. I guess the high rating can only be considered fair if you keep in mind this a niche product for a certain audience with a lot of time and willpower that they don't need to put into more important tasks. For anyone else I recommend to play other, more accessible and fun games. In the end I can't fully accept this ""niche argument"" for a good rating though - as there is a huge problem with this approach. I'll give an example: Even if your not a fan of sports games you could still enjoy playing a top sports title. However this game is simply not enjoyable without some masochistic tendencies and the willingness to succumb to ""outdated"" gaming philosophies (hidden mechanics, no proper explanations or directions, no quest logs, no map, no difficulty settings etc). I feel sekiro would have profited a lot from more fun and user friendly / accessibility / comfort elements because the stealth, movement and parry aspects would be a very solid core with a more user friendly design policy. I think this game is slightly overtuned (the character is a bit too fragile) so giving the user a difficulty option would have made it a lot more accessible. So if your not sure about yourself being part of the target audience I would consider skipping this experience. However... if your willing to get into this game and have the means to beat it can be a very intense experience. It gave me some very unique and rewarding experiences but overall felt it wasn't worth all the trouble. I kinda hope for a Sekiro 2 with the option to have a slightly more casual friendly experience. On hindsight Sekiro was overall a too annoying experience so I feel I kinda wasted time on something that was taking a lot and giving too little.",8,2023-07-29,PC,user

There is no rolling to dodge, parrying doesn't work, when you encounter many enemies at once. I don't know what exactly smoked creators of this game, but it was not good.

zSh4dow_,"Full From Software style but for the first time a truly solid and well-functioning game in its mechanics. The combat system is certainly the thing that stands out the most, the posture and deflection system intrinsically changes the gameplay of the game, differentiating it widely from the older Dark Souls or Bloodborne. For the first time, with rare exceptions, I didn't complain about hitboxes, which in their previous works seemed designed by visually impaired people... they probably have hired more capable developers. The game is objectively difficult, deliberately bastard, but surprisingly easy to understand. Many enemies will test you, but once you understand the moveset it will be downhill. And this is obviously in line with the souls-like trend. Much more action and less RPG, even if it comes with some features in line with the genre. Sekiro certainly has less replay value as you won't be able to make any particular builds, the protagonist is a Shinobi and his weapon will remain the same from start to finish.",9,2023-06-02,PC,user

Honest-Review,"The biggest issue I have with Sekiro is that it demands perfection from the player, yet punishes them for even the slightest misstep. The game's combat system is incredibly unforgiving, with enemies dealing massive damage with every hit and the player being forced to dodge and parry with split-second precision. This would be fine if the game's hit detection and controls were up to par, but unfortunately, they are not. Too often, I found myself dying because of bad hit detection or clunky controls. Sometimes, I would dodge an attack only to be hit anyway because the game didn't register my movement correctly. Other times, I would try to jump over an obstacle, only to get stuck on it and take damage from an enemy. These issues are frustrating enough on their own, but when combined with the game's punishing difficulty, they make for an experience that is more aggravating than enjoyable. Furthermore, while the game's story and world-building are certainly impressive, I found that they were often overshadowed by the game's difficulty. Instead of being able to fully immerse myself in the game's lore and characters, I was constantly stressed out about the next fight and whether or not I would be able to survive it. In conclusion, while I can see why some people might enjoy Sekiro's challenging gameplay, I personally find it to be a bad game due to its demanding nature and flawed mechanics. I hope that future games in the same vein will learn from Sekiro's mistakes and provide a more balanced and enjoyable experience for players.",3,2023-04-28,PC,user

skdcraw,"Hesitation is defeat. Frankly, I had high expectations from Sekiro. And it fully met my expectations. First of all, Sekiro is a great looking game. I must say that he used the famous Japanese aesthetic very well. The game seems to have put landscapes at certain points for us to see and say wow. So the scenery is plentiful in the game. But other than that, it's kind of like the same thing. But I'm not saying the whole game is like that, it's like the game feels a bit like we're in the same place. It's not just about having to come to the same place 3 different times. Although they are different places, they look like the same places and are not very characteristic regions. For example, if you show me a picture from Dark Souls, I will immediately tell you where it is. But this game. Especially those roofs. After a while, the whole game feels like you're walking on these roofs. However, this does not mean that there are no different places in the game. There are some beautiful places like Hirata Estate where you go back to the past, Sunken Valley where you fight a snake, and Fountainhead Palace, which has a very nice atmosphere. However, for some reason, the game seemed a little small to me. The sounds of the game are great. Just the deflect sound makes this game great. The sounds of the sword were constantly encouraging me to play more. The music is also wonderful. Although I don't like the ambient music of the regions and I don't find it characteristic, the music of the bosses will definitely be engraved in your mind because they are beautiful (and you die a lot). So how is the story of the game? It's more open than Dark Souls, but just as closed. What does it mean? That is to say, there is no abstract universe that is difficult to understand. There are people, there is war, we are in Japan. So far, it's clear. But the details of the story, what is going on, are still not clearly explained to you. You are asked to collect from right to left. Actually, I'm not against games telling their stories like this. However, after playing games such as God of War, which tells its story in a very beautiful and cinematic way, I started to wonder if this cryptic game narration is a deficiency. My criticism in this regard is as follows: At least, it would be better if the part of the game that tells the main plot of the game was explained to us clearly, if we want to gain more lore information, we can learn them by collecting items from right to left, as DS do. But playing without knowing the main plot ****, or making an extra effort to know it, seems not quite right, but I will not comment on this. Personally, I like such statements, but when we look at it, maybe it's a bit of escapism. I don't know, I'm undecided. So what is this game about? Despite the beautiful stories of the characters in the game, I could not understand the message we should get from this journey, although I do not know how much I understood. So yes, the stories we hear from right to left are beautiful, but is ours also beautiful? We do what a girl says. I later learned that there was an important choice that we had to make in the game and it directly affected the game. But since I didn't understand what it was, I immediately made a simple choice. Gameplay is where Sekiro shines. No matter what anyone says, I don't remember seeing such a good kombat in any game. Plus it's so simple. Attack, block or dodge. Or use one of the prosthetic features. But watching them is not enough to understand how enjoyable they are. You must play. First you have to say, ""This boss is impossible to kill. He won't let me hit him. How do I know if I'm going to jump when the red mark comes out, am I going to counter with Mikiri?"" Half an hour after saying that, when you kill the same Boss without taking damage, you realize that there is no problem with the Boss, and when you learn that you played badly, you realize how easy it is. That's what happens most of the time. The feeling of satisfaction when you act like a surgeon and do everything you need to do is indescribable. And the good thing about it is that you learn that. The game doesn't send you enemies just to beat you like every game, it sends you to hit your head. E hits your head. But then when he finds out and you hit him on the head... It's a great feeling. Actually, that's the whole Dark Souls logic, but Sekiro is a little different. Because this game is not an RPG. You can't get stronger and come back and pass the boss comfortably. You have to act on your own ability. I would like to add a little advice to this part, if you want to improve your game and have more fun, always stand in front of your enemy. Don't run away and hit, just run to get health. Deflect everything and hit at every gap. Even if it is difficult at first, it makes the game more enjoyable and easier after you get used to it.",8,2023-04-26,PC,user

lesiuML,"Despite general opinion Sekiro is not a very hard game. Sekiro required from the player a lot of patience and often a lot of understanding of the game mechanics. With knowledge gained along the way player become more aware of the fighting and parying mechanics and the overall gameplay becomes easier. In my opinion Sekiro is really outstanding, beautiful setting of feudal Japan, detailed locations and well crafted textures are making this game very atmospheric. Every encounter is unique and memorable. Every NPC is joy to listen. Every side story is well written. If you like challenging games or you just think this game looks fun - definitely try to beat it. And if you are stuck just remember that sometimes with just a little bit of help from YouTube everything is possible!",9,2023-04-10,PC,user

Bushido_DZ95,"The most stylish soulslike combat system. Unlike the recent release of ""Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty"", Sekiro clearly shows the animations and the blows themselves. It is a pity that Hidetaka Miyazaki did not develop this combat system further. The game was completed about 8-9 times and every time it was a pleasure to return to the game. The story and atmosphere are good. The most amazing thing is that the music is very boring.. in other Miyazaki games the music is just great and I still listen to many tracks, but in Sekiro there is not a single memorable track.",9,2023-03-12,PC,user
TheW4tchT0wer,"I'll give it a couple points for art design. Combat is terrible when coupled with obvious developer bugs (e.g. controller input lag and dropped/unregistered inputs. Curious how it only happens in From Software games and no others....). Sekiro dials up the From Software 'sunk cost' illogic of its fanbase to 12. 'Just keep at it until you git gud' except the combat is centered around these scripted death animations where the camera goes cinematic and then back to normal every few seconds when fighting a large number of enemies. How about instead, just let me fight all the enemies and kill them like a normal action game without the Alice in Wonderland syndrome? I gave it a few hours to see what the hype was all about. It should be a textbook lesson in poor game design that should be avoided at all costs with its counterpoint being Ninja Gaiden Black about what to strive for in a great action game.",2,2023-03-10,PC,user
dante0615,"This game tells a story about a ninja/shinobi in ancient Japan. If you are bored with other games, sekiro might be your choice. It's extremely hard. Here's my advice before playing, I hope it can help anyone. First, don't use pirated versions but buy one. Although sekiro can be played offline, but online versions of those soulsborne games contain a funny function: you can see other players' shadows, their reaction, and their words for other players. They indicated the right path for you, as well as the locations of some easter eggs and rare items Second, in order to get rid of spoilers, don't search it on youtube or Reddit. Sekiro's story was not amazing but the enemy's design is impressive. The way they appear, and change phases, I'm sure it will shock everyone on their first play. Then, enjoy your fight. Sekiro had a unique ability to resurrection which give you another chance to continue your fight when you failed. However, the game is still super hard. When your character died, you will lose half of your money and exp but your level will be kept. And the power of sekiro is based on taking others' power, so the more times your resurrection, the weaker the NPC will be. They even will be ill so you can't interact with them. Important NPCs such as the businessman's illness won't stop his trade, So the illness won't stop the extension of the main story. If you are afraid of death punishments, you can use a trainer like me. Different from other games, the player grows in the game as well as the character. When you are familiar with the enemy's move, you will enjoy the combat and know the joy of the game. Remeber, hesitation is defeat.",9,2023-03-03,PC,user
TobiCaig19,"Sekiro: Sadows Die Twice es el primer juego de este tipo que he probado, y tengo que decir que ha sido una maravillosa experiencia. Jam√°s hab√≠a jugado un souls pensando que ese tipo de juegos no era para m√≠: morir una y otra vez hasta aprenderte los combos del enemigo y, finalmente derrotarlo; sin embargo, he de decir que ha sido extremadamente satisfactorio. El juego, sobre todo al principio, es muy complicado y a medida que vas avanzando en la historia, la cual es muy digna, y profundizas en el sistema de combate te das cuenta del maravilloso trabajo que ha hecho FromSoftware implementando un sistema de parry que cuando lo ""dominas"" es un aut√©ntico deleite audiovisual. Puntos positivos: Una historia bien escrita que da pie a que haya una futura secuela. Un sistema de combate muy satisfactorio, combinado con el uso de las diferentes herramientas shinobi. Un apartado art√≠stico fabuloso. NG+ para los amantes de un desaf√≠o a√∫n mayor. Puntos negativos: Unos gr√°ficos son mejorables. La c√°mara, que en ocasiones te deja vendido y te cagas en todo. El no poder usar varias habilidades en un mismo combate sin interrumpir la batalla (para cambiar de movimientos tienes que ir al men√∫ y cambiarlo manualmente, cosa que desaprovecha, en mi opini√≥n, la variedad de movientos que te ofrece el juego. No poder luchar contra el miniboss que te apetezca una vez pasado el juego, as√≠ como ocurre con los jefes. En conclusi√≥n, es un antes y un despu√©s en mi experiencia jugando videojuegos.

SrKano,"This game is focused on combat and it's great there. It's hard and perfect. When you learn to fight, you feel powerful. Narrative 8/10 Characters 9/10 Graphics 7/10 World 9/10 Gameplay 10/10 - The combat is perfect. Hard, but perfect. Usually, when you play a game you feel that you are stronger than normal enemies and weaker than bosses. In Sekiro you feel equal to all of them. All the enemies can kill you 1vs1. But also, you don't need to run and wait for a window to attack a boss because you are as strong as him. - The gameplay is not based on farming and getting stronger. You can farm but is not going to make a difference. You have to know your enemy and your character. You have to know how to fight. And the sword fights are incredible. - The story and characters are fine, it's clear, linear, and kind of interesting (more if you love the japan culture). - The world is great. It feels like levels that you have to beat, but the game is focused on that so it's okay. The mobility and the possibilities of ""solving"" the levels are amazing.

JPKarma,"Simplesmente uma perfei√ß√£o. Estou completamente apaixonado por este jogo. De in√≠cio, tive muita dificuldade, pois √© uma experi√™ncia bem diferente dos souls-like (apesar de nunca me sentir frustrado por entender que morrer faz parte do jogo, √© um aprendizado, realmente n√£o √© para matar todos os chefes de segunda ou terceira), e por um bom tempo n√£o estava muito animado, mas a partir do ponto que me acostumei com a mec√¢nica, me apaixonei por tudo o que aparecia na minha frente. Em uma segunda jogatina eu confirmei o que j√° imaginava, era tudo culpa minha. Eu n√£o estava jogando bem, mas quando consegui me adaptar, vi que, embora ainda haja uma boa dificuldade, o jogo √© bem justo e te d√° muitos recursos. Particularmente eu n√£o sou de usar buffs e outros itens, mas ent√£o o jogo jogou na minha cara que eu era um shinobi, n√£o um samurai honrado. O lance √© tacar cinzas na cara, pegar por tr√°s, usar esquemas e montar estrat√©gias, e principalmente aprender a ter calma, pois a barra de vida serve praticamente para regular a de postura, e em vez de me desesperae pra causar dano, o ideal √© se defender e evitar dano para que aproveite melhor as brechas do inimigo. O combate desse jogo √© uma das melhores coisas que j√° vi, a explora√ß√£o √© recompendadora, a ordem dos lugares a visitar √© razoavelmente livre, tudo aqui √© lindo e bem constru√≠do, com m√≠nimos detalhes que enriquecem muito o jogo se voc√™ prestar aten√ß√£o.

itsoskej,"Sekiro is the best FromSoftware game to date. We cannot compare Sekiro to any other FromSoftware, or even any other action game in history, because it‚Äôs the other way around. This game is a benchmark that people can use to compare other action games to. FromSoftware certainly took different approach to this game than to any other souls so far. While their games are not well known for STORY, their lore, worldbuilding and environmental storytelling are one of the best in the industry. The different approach we‚Äôre talking about in Sekiro is that FromSoftware picked more straightforward, western storytelling with subtle hints to past events creating the environment that we find ourselves in while playing the game, just enough to understand the situation we‚Äôre in. The mission is pretty simple, doing what our master, Kuro, wants us to do. And he wants us to find a way to severe his immortality. The journey to accomplish that, however, is full of hardships‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶and that is where Sekiro shines the most. The journey, the gameplay is so polished it leaves other action games in dirt, and continues to do so for 3 years at the time of this review. On paper Sekiros combat is pretty simple. Move around, jump, break poise (with help of tools, if needed), deflect/parry and that‚Äôs about it. However to combine everything together and utilize in the most efficient way to get through the bosses is no easy task. In comparison, Dark Souls I is turn-based game. Enemies will not wait for you here, and it‚Äôs either you who loses footing, or them. There‚Äôs plenty ways to be humbled, and the best one, per usual, are the bosses. Every single one of them cutting your brain out to, and then perform operation reconstructing your whole nervous system to achieve Post-traumatic stress disorder every time you hear them reintroducing themselves for 70th time this day when you step into their boss arena. Boss encounters in this videogame are something you come back to leter on, especially with gauntlet of strength that lets you face them every time you think you‚Äôre ready to be bullied by them again and again. This game, in comparison to Dark Souls series, is especially hard, because essentially there is no help outside of getting better at it. There are no summons, there is no cheese (almost), there is no overpowered equipment you can use to make it easier, there is no leveling vigor, strength or dex. You‚Äôre on your, and the credits should be something everyone sees.",9,2023-01-02,PC,user

maluigario,"TL;DR: Blazing fast combat with an emphasis on stealth and parrying in feudal Japan make this a fun, though sometimes frustrating, game. There's a reason SoulsBorne isn't usually called SoulSekiroBorne: This game shares little in terms of core mechanics with any of the other games in FromSoftware's action-adventure lineup. The combat is incredibly fast-paced; none of the skills you learned in the other Souls titles will help you here. You focus more on depleting an enemy's stamina by perfectly parrying their attacks than you worry about depleting their health, as an enemy with an empty stamina guage is left open for a death blow. Sneaking and verticality also feature as core mechanics. One of the big cons in Sekiro is that the emphasis on parrying can make the process of tackling bosses feel more daunting as you try to perfectly learn their attack patterns. While a SoulsBorne game give you dodging, shielding, and parry/riposte as defensive maneuvers, Sekiro's only defense is the parry mechanic. This means advancing the battle requires perfect parries to deplete their stamina; there is almost no way to use hit and run or make a ""heavy-strength build"" that focuses on dealing damage. This can mke the process of learning the bosses attack patterns feel daunting as you keep dying, and you can't ""panic parry"" your way to victory. The other drawback compared to other SoulsBorne titles is the lack of replayability. The game has a New Game+, but playing the game again offers little variation upon return. There are no ""new builds"" for you to try; you have your one weapon, and you invest your upgrades on Shinobi Tools you mostly won't use and Shinobi Arts that I personally got almost no use out of. Even with its drawbacks, Sekiro is a stand-out title. The combat is fun and a nice change of pace from FromSoft's other titles. It's a breath of fresh air that's absolutely worth your time.",8,2022-12-07,PC,user

Crimson9,"In Sekiro, From Software trades variety in gameplay for a laser focus on one style of gameplay and adds as much depth and polish to it as possible. Add to this the extremely good bosses and enemy encounters and the end result is hands down the best combat in any game. This combat has already influenced many other games and is the new gold standard for sword fighting. In other departments, the game is good but not exceptional. The level design, lore, atmosphere, and nonlinearity are good but don't reach anywhere near DS1 levels.

MagicManEivor,"This is a really, really good game. And here's why. The combat, unlike what everyone says, is fast paced, tense and never gets boring thanks to a barrage of interesting bosses and enemy types. As you unlock new skills, new tools, new ninjitu and shinobi arts, you get a lot more freedom in how you approach the game. The game feels good to play with great controls and an expanded movement. You can jump like you're on Saturn and sneak kill a guy, then run up to a mini boss and get him from the back for an easy 1 phase down. The graphics are great. I'm not usually into realistic graphics, I usually prefer a unique artstyle to feel different but I think it works here. The enemies all look and feel different and thanks to that the ways to approach are different too. The world varies in look and feel and is really immersive. The story is also great. I love easy to follow stories that have tons of lore behind them and this game didn't disappoint. It tells a rich story that I fell in love with. Now, onto the bad. The camera is really good anywhere, apart from bosses in small, enclosed areas. The bosses get reused often with one or two different attacks. And the worst thing about this game, and most fs games (from what I heard about) is that they expect you to know what to do. I felt like searching up a guide is nessecary in many parts. Otherwise a 10 out of 10. But this makes it a 9 for me.",9,2022-07-27,PC,user
CoolBR,"As a Souls series veteran, I was really surprised by how good is the gameplay of this game. It is a lot faster than DS and has three different types of dodges and those features make de combat system a lot more fun. The ambientation is incredible with gorgeous scenarios (Fountainhead Palace) and the variety of enemies and especially bosses is incredible there are bossies of different types and shapes, and all are very cool to face. The story when I played I really liked but after that, I forgot. It has some good plot twists but is a forgettable story because you don't have the same attachment to the characters as the games with really good stories that work on the characters that build up your attachment over time, like Atreus and Kratos relationship on God of War or the relationship among Arthur and his gang on RDR2. Here in Sekiro, I don't know exactly the protagonist and his Master (Kuro) and the game doesn't build up either, so the plot twists are cool, the story is cool but is forgettable because you don't really like the characters.",9,2022-07-08,PC,user

ErayTellezi,"M√ºthi≈ü, combat tatmini olarak oynadƒ±klarƒ±mƒ±n en iyilerinden birisi ve kesinlikle oynadƒ±ƒüƒ±m en zor oyun. Final boss'u yenmem 7 saatimi aldƒ± ve ancak cheese'leyerek, namert√ße d√∂v√º≈üerek kesebildim. Ancak bundan √∂nce oynadƒ±ƒüƒ±m tek soulslike oyun olan Bloodborne'la kƒ±yaslayacak olursak bazƒ± eksileri yok deƒüil. En b√ºy√ºk eksisi atmosferi. Bloodborne oynarken adƒ±m ba≈üƒ± nasƒ±l ilgin√ß yaratƒ±klar kar≈üƒ±ma √ßƒ±kacak, ne bi√ßim mekanlara gireceƒüiz diye korka korka ve b√ºy√ºk bir merak i√ßerisinde oynuyordum. Sekiro'nun elbette b√∂yle bir amacƒ± yok ama beni kendisine hayran bƒ±rakacak bir atmosfer sunamadƒ±. Oyunun ana d√∂v√º≈ü mekaniƒüi parry. D√º≈üman saldƒ±rƒ±larƒ±nƒ± son anda kƒ±lƒ±cƒ±nƒ±zla blocklayarak dayanƒ±klƒ±lƒ±ƒüƒ±nƒ± bitirmeye √ßalƒ±≈üƒ±yorsunuz. Dayanƒ±klƒ±lƒ±ƒüƒ± bitince de tek yiyor zaten. D√º≈üman ve onlarƒ±n saldƒ±rƒ± ≈üemalarƒ±nƒ±n √ße≈üitliliƒüi g√∂z √∂n√ºne alƒ±ndƒ±ƒüƒ±nda bu i≈ü o kadar da kolay deƒüil. Parry'yi erken yaparsanƒ±z sizin dayanƒ±klƒ±lƒ±ƒüƒ±nƒ±z normalden √ßok daha fazla gidiyor. Ge√ß kalƒ±rsanƒ±z da canƒ±nƒ±z. Parry Bloodborne'da √ßok opsiyoneldi ve yapmasƒ± ger√ßekten zordu, boss sava≈ülarƒ±nda neredeyse hi√ßbir i≈üe yaramƒ±yordu. Parry yapmadan Bloodborne √ßok rahat biter ancak Sekiro'da m√ºmk√ºn deƒüil, oyunun direk temel d√∂v√º≈ü mekaniƒüi. Ki bir savunma hareketinin temel d√∂v√º≈ü mekaniƒüi olmasƒ± biraz ilgin√ß. Ancak ger√ßekten de Sekiro'da savunma yaparak d√º≈ümanlarƒ±nƒ±zƒ± yeniyorsunuz. Neredeyse her zaman d√º≈ümanlarƒ±nƒ±zƒ±n canlarƒ±ndan √∂nce dayanƒ±klƒ±lƒ±klarƒ± bitiyor. Oyunda sadece bir tane temel silahƒ±mƒ±z var. Protez kolunuzu benim gibi sƒ±klƒ±kla kullanmƒ±yorsanƒ±z bu durumun d√∂v√º≈ülerin tekd√ºze ge√ßmesine neden olduƒüunu d√º≈ü√ºnebilirsiniz ama deƒüil. Zira Bloodborne'un da y√ºzde 80'ini tek kƒ±lƒ±√ßla oynadƒ±m ve bunun gibi onun da d√º≈üman ve o d√º≈ümanlarƒ±n pattern √ße≈üitliliƒüi vardƒ±. Bu sayede tek kƒ±lƒ±√ßla oynamanƒ±n eksisi hi√ß hissedilmiyor. Kaldƒ± ki protez kolla yapƒ±labilen bir√ßok ≈üey var. Bunlarƒ± dilediƒüiniz gibi √ße≈üitli kullanabilirsiniz. Bunun yanƒ±nda yetenek puanƒ±yla geli≈üen, oynayƒ±≈üƒ±nƒ±zƒ± o kadar derinden etkilemese de bir ka√ß √ße≈üitlilik saƒülayan skilleriniz var. Bunlarƒ± protez kolla beraber kullanabileceƒüiniz combo'lar yaratabiliyorsunuz. Oyunda √ßok sayƒ±da boss ve mini boss var. Miniboss'larƒ±n √ßoƒüu ve boss'larƒ±n da 1-2 tanesi kendisini tekrar ediyor. Ancak bunun bir sorun olduƒüunu s√∂yleyemem. √ñzellikle seven ashina spears mini boss'unun beni √ßoƒüu ana boss'tan daha √ßok zorladƒ±ƒüƒ±nƒ± s√∂ylemeliyim. En √ßok zorlandƒ±ƒüƒ±m boss'lar ise isshin sword saint ve guardian ape oldu. Son boss'u elbet keseceƒüim belliydi, sonu√ßta oraya kadar gelmi≈üim bƒ±rakmak olmaz ama guardian ape'te bir ara rage quit attƒ±m ve hile a√ßmayƒ± d√º≈ü√ºnd√ºm. Bari etrafƒ± gezeyim dedim ve mortal blade'i buldum. Ger√ßekten onurumu ****. √ñlmek ve onun cezalandƒ±rƒ±lmasƒ±nda da farklƒ±lƒ±klar var. Bir kere tekrar doƒüabiliyorsunuz. Bunun yanƒ±nda can iksirleriniz kendiliƒüinden yenileniyor. Bu da Bloodborne'daki gibi tekrar tekrar √∂ld√ºƒü√ºn√ºz boss sava≈ülarƒ±na ara verip can iksiri satƒ±n almaya yetecek para biriktirmek i√ßin grind yapmanƒ±zƒ± engelliyor. Ancak Sekiro'da √∂lmek paranƒ±zƒ±n ve tecr√ºbe puanƒ±nƒ±zƒ±n bir kƒ±smƒ±nƒ±n temelli gitmesi anlamƒ±na geliyor. Bir de √∂ld√ºk√ße hastalƒ±k yayƒ±lƒ±yor ve hastalanan npc'lerle konu≈üamƒ±yorsunuz. Sekiro, Bloodborne'a g√∂re bir tƒ±k daha fazla hikaye anlatƒ±yor. Kim kimdir, amacƒ± nedir biraz daha anlƒ±yorsunuz ama normal oyunlardaki gibi apa√ßƒ±klƒ±k yine yok. Sekiro en zoruydu dedim ama o kadar da emin deƒüilim. Ne olursa olsun bu oyunda kendini korumanƒ±n birden √ßok y√∂ntemi var. Hi√ßbir ≈üey yapamasan block'luyorsun. Bir de bu oyuna alƒ±≈ümak Bloodborne'dan daha kolay geldi bana. ƒ∞kinci souls oyunum olduƒüundan ya da parry mantƒ±ƒüƒ± √ßok benzer olan Ghost of Tsushima'yƒ± yeni oynadƒ±ƒüƒ±mdan olabilir. Neyse sonu√ßta bir zamanlar hayatta oynayamam dediƒüim iki oyunu bitirdim. Keyifliydi. Bloodborne'da eksikliƒüini √ßok hissettiƒüim √∂ld√ºrd√ºƒü√ºn boss'larla tekrar kapƒ±≈üma √∂zelliƒüi Sekiro'da var ama tekrar d√∂v√º≈ümek istediƒüim bir boss (biri hari√ß) olmadƒ±. Bence boss sava≈üƒ± epikliƒüi bloodborne'da daha iyi. Sekiro'da genelde kendi boyutumuzda insanlarƒ± d√∂v√ºyoruz √ß√ºnk√º.",9,2022-06-04,PC,user

Jabbawockee,"I've yet to play all From Soft titles, but out of the ones I have had a chance to play, Sekiro is my favorite. Its gameplay is sufficiently different from the Souls games through its emphasis on parrying that it forced me to ""git gud"" all over again, even after just coming off Dark Souls III. I find the setting, story and word design more appealing in Sekiro than the normal lack of color found in the other Souls games. While some found the more linear design of Sekiro to be a detriment, I found it easier to engage with than the overly-complex RPG elements of the other titles, making it seem, at least to me, that the bosses and encounters were more approachable and curated - which significantly cut down on the grind game that was somewhat prominent other titles.",9,2022-05-06,PC,user

Tux89,"Absolute masterpiece. I bought Sekiro after playing Elden Ring, wondering if their other games are possibly as good as Elden Ring. It was quite a shock when I realised Elden Ring is the ""bad game"". Not in general, but in this context for sure. Sekiro beats Elden Ring in nearly every regard (that matters to me personally), with better controls, fast, but skillful combat, unique interesting bosses and refined difficulty - no, in this game you don't get to overlevel and cheese your way to the ending, this is actual ""git gud"" game :D. And this is not meant to be punishment to the player, this is actually what makes the game rewarding. The feeling after beating last boss in Sekiro and beating last boss in Elden Ring is incomparable. Even outside of this scope, where I mostly compare Sekiro to the latest From Software game, Sekiro still dominates. I played UNHEALTHY amount of games in my life and few I'd rate as high as this one.",10,2022-03-24,PC,user

Somy,"Sekiro is legitimately one of the most unique and breathtaking experiences I have ever had in gaming, full stop. The setting of Sengoku-era Japan is quite uniquely-presented, and it almost felt like this was FromSoft's ode to their home country with how much love they put into the design of the areas. The atmosphere is simply amazing. The combat is the most unique that I've seen, and it differs dramatically from other FromSoft games as well as most games on the market. Instead of whittling down a massive health bar, Sekiro demands precise aggression to break the opponent's poise. Fights feel extremely skill-based, and bosses that feel impossible at first try can be a breeze once you figure out how to defeat them. The combat is very focused on human enemies, however, and while the game attempts to deviate from them with certain beast-like enemies, I felt that they didn't quite fit into the combat system. Overall, everything about Sekiro is absolutely stunning; its setting, its music, its atmosphere, and its combat. The story may be somewhat cryptic but there's a sense of sheer awe that's difficult to describe that holds true throughout the entire game. It's personally one of my top games of all time, and I think everybody who has the ability to experience it has to do it in their lifetime.",10,2022-03-04,PC,user

GizMoIgor,"Sekiro: Shadows Die twice is a great game. The game is almost perfect, and although it may have a few flaws I enjoyed my full 43 hours of experience in this game. First of all the story and the theme of the Sengoku era is absolutely amazing. Although this may not be souls-like game in 100%, this game is definitely a challenge, and if you are a Dark Souls player, you will need to completely change your instincts and attidute towards some enemies. The game is based on parring and blocking instead of dodging, and in my opinion it's a great change. The game may seem like it has very little mechanics and options in it at the start. But there are a lot of skills, techniques and gadgets which make it so that you can experiment in a lot of ways. As I mentioned before the game is not so easy, but it's also not notoriously difficult. The play time is well balanced, so that it is not too short nor too long with average time to beat the game about 30 hours. If you are a player that likes challenges as well as swordsman fights with the dodge mechanic excluded, making it a whole new experience then this is the game for you.",9,2022-02-11,PC,user
namelessrequiem,"8/10, it is a very fun but the over reliance on deflecting turns me off a bit",8,2022-02-08,PC,user
hhac,"My first written review **** so this will be horrible The gameplay was really fun, I love high octane, fast-paced gameplay and this certainly did deliver. Although I only figured out the combat system, on the 25% mark and after that, everything was smooth sailing, I barely struggled on bosses or mini-bosses. the only thing I was really bad at was beast bosses/mini-bosses, especially the demon of hatred. That boss was the hardest thing I have ever done in a video game, though that might change. I didn't struggle with the final boss that much like everyone else did, I was at 19 vitality, and I believe 13 attack power. I'm confident in saying that I am GOOD at deflecting. Part is thanks to the Genichiro fight, I struggled with it probably the most at first just cause it was so early in the game and after I became more aggressive with my deflects and didn't step dodge everything like in the other soul's games I pretty much immediately won the fight. And also, the gameplay is different from soulsborne games, different enough to not be a soulsborne game but a souls-like, it has different mechanics like prosthetics and ninjutsu, special moves, and other stuff and I really liked every one of the mechanic Really solid gameplay this game has to offer. Top-notch The story, ah yes the story. This will contain spoilers so beware if you at all care about them. I enjoyed the story, the story wasn't deep and ""edgy"" as dark souls story, and you didn't have to search that deep to get the gist of it but none the less it was really enjoyable. I love storytelling where you have to find it yourself, on your own time. But the surface-level story was also really good. I really love how midgame and endgame the main area Ashina outskirts and Ashina castle get changed from a city to a brunt down battlefield There is a total of 4 endings, on my first playthrough, I chose the immortal severance ending, the ending where you break the iron code, kill your father and sever the ties of immorality by killing Kuro, which was really moving and sad, cause im a big dunce and didn't catch on that I will have to kill Kuro, if I knew, I still would've followed the ending cause I thought it was the right thing to do. Before I completed the game I thought there would be two endings, maybe one secret one but I was too committed to the ending I aimed for. I have played this game only once, and I don't know what happens in the other ending but I heard that the return ending is the ""good"" ending or more accurately the best ending. I have a dilemma with fighting/killing human opponents. For example, I really didn't want to kill the owl, I was hoping there was a mercy option but after I had to kill him he said something along the lines of, ""well-done son/wolf"" and that was very moving to me, same goes for Lady butterfly, I didn't know she was wolfs mentor while fighting her but when she said ""you've grown wolf"" in the last moments of her life I felt like **** A really solid story. What else, oh yeah the visuals. I don't have a good pc, but since sekiro and every fromsoftware game is well optimized ""despite having so many areas rendered"". I could run it on medium-high settings, and despite not playing on max setting, the game looks **** incredible, probably because I have never played a 2019 triple a game. I was watching a gameplay video of sekiro and they played on I believe max settings it looked incredible, like so good, especially the lighting. And now, my final point the difficulty, the main marketing of souls-like games. And sekiro is hard, really hard just like any other soul like, but most of it is fair difficulty and also fun challenges. There is one mini-boss that I absolutely despise and cannot refight him ever and that's headless, I don't think the fight is fun it's cheap mechanics and overall the terror abnormality is a pain in the ass, just like the other variants of it in the souls borne franchise. Almost every single move your opponent makes is perfectly telegraphed and you know what to do, but sometimes if you panic you button mash and get gravely injured. I don't really know how to end this review but I have to say, this game is good, really good. Not my favorite but up there in my top 10. id give it an 85/100.",9,2022-02-05,PC,user

Sam_Unger,"I think this is the only videogame that deserves the ""must play"" tag I've played all the from software games, but this is the only game that made me feel like no game I've ver played, like I'm the boss in the fight, like I'm...A shura.I've played all God of War saga, all Metal Gear Saga, all The Witcher saga, Zelda, Max Payne, Gta, Red dead, The Elder Scrolls, Fallout 3, AC games, far cry, Bioshock trilogy... None of those games are like this masterpiece, this is the most genuine gaming experience I've ever had on my life",9,2022-01-12,PC,user
Starychok,"Despite I've played all of souls-likes, I couldn't understand this game. Game is difficult in not a good meaning at all. Character progression is almost absent, a lot of skills, most of which are useless, no variety in weapons/builds or anything (just secondary helpers, but this is nothing), battle mechanics are totally about timing and repeating, except of scripted boss-fights, level of fun - below zero. As for me, this game doesn't deserve to be a part of phenomenal souls series. Still game levels are really beautiful, so 3 of 10.",3,2022-01-11,PC,user
D1V,"Great swordplay, the human bosses are the best. Can be pretty difficult at times as expected from a fromsoftware's game, but most bosses have a weakness you can use to make you gameplay easier even with average mechanics, for example fire crackers can make the warrior on a horse boss pretty easy, and the game gives a hint about it as well. Some people say that they would not recommend it to someone new to soulsborn games, but think it might be the perfect first game. The setting isn't dark and pressuring, which I enjoyed and a player doesn't get overwhelmed with a **** tone of stats and possible builds. The graphics are pretty good the performance is good as well",9,2022-01-08,PC,user

GoyangDufus,"Sekiro is a one of a kind game. I came into this knowing that it would kick my ass. And it kicked my ass really hard the first time around. I even gave up after 10 hours of being stuck in the first area. However, the difficulty is what kept me in this game and kept me motivated. The gameplay in this game is absolutely amazing. The rhythmic gameplay rewards skill more than anything. Once you master it you can go around the game feeling like a god. The level design is great and the bosses are great.",10,2021-12-30,PC,user
teratoma666,"The best swordfight combat system that currently exists on the market. Because of the complexity of it, we might never see another game that tries to use it to this extent, but hopefully we get more games that borrows aspects of it like Fallen Order did. The world and atmosphere are also great with very down to earth feeling. Unlike most AAA games, it doesn't have a bombastic blockbuster presentation from western developers or overly bubbly and/or dramatic delivery like it's from Asia. It's a unique masterpiece that solidified FromSoft as true masters of game design, world building and atmosphere.",10,2021-12-23,PC,user
Watson0l0,"The game is much more difficult than other solus likes, for some it may be too much (me!)). Various hitbox, camera and animation issues still persist, as well as completely unbalanced enemies.",7,2021-12-23,PC,user
Mehrshad_MB,"No wonder why Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice won the Game of the Year Award. It's an excellent game with great story, graphics, gameplay and environment. The variety of enemies and bosses were incredible. There are lots of complains here about combat system; I agree with some of them, the combat system is truly limited. Dodging is almost useless and the only option to defend seems to be parrying... I mean the game is already difficult, why would you limit the combat mechanics to make it even more difficult? I wish the game had some customizing options for armor, swords and etc. Therefore, in my opinion, although Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice absolutely deserved the GOTY award, but I think it could be way better than this, if some features were added.

NfeKteD,"In Sekiro, if you go with your head thinking that you are playing DarkSouls or BloodBorne, you will be very angry. Unlike the company's games, this one is not based on dodging attacks, but defending and reflecting the blows. However, the essence still remains the same, be patient until you find a loophole for 1 or 2 attacks every 30 seconds to a few minutes. The most different thing is not choosing your stats, like strength and etc because everything is done automatically, so if you don't want to keep thinking about these build things it's great. The setting, and bosses, are extremely striking too. Only complaint is the huge delay to get experience at the end of the game, if you want to get all skills you will probably find yourself farming experience in the same place for hours and hours. The game at first seems much more difficult than it seems, however, when you understand how the game works (towards the end, or in an NG+) it ends up becoming a ""walk in the park with grandma"" once you understand all mechanics.",9,2021-11-22,PC,user

jarvitom,"Its hard but this game needs to be conquered and mastered. I could do all the achievements and felt a great joy, the best feeling is when you kill that hard end boss with just your last life and feel that euphoric feeling. - level design and world is 10/10 - the storyline could have been a bit more deeper - bit annoying that you have to fight bosses multiple times, could have just come up with like 3 new ones - gameplay, combat, being a ninja simulator is fantastic - some prosthetics are never used, some goes for combat arts, could have been better if they are balanced a bit more - opened a completely new sub-genre within soulslike games",9,2021-11-15,PC,user

SilverOrlov,"I love and hate this game at the same time)) Nice and interesting story. Deep atmosphere. The concept with immortality, the consequences of resurrection, different types of immortality - generally delighted. I've seen stories like this in the books, but I haven't played one myself. The combat system makes you suffer wildly at the beginning. To sweat in the middle, even on simple enemies. And to fight like a real warrior with a katana in the end... but with bosses and mini-bosses, it's a little more difficult. They are all interesting and varied, but after Nioh, there is a deeper variety missing, not just different two samurai with different move-sets for example. Therefore, I was happy to fight the dead and monsters in this game. This is a very unconventional game in terms of gameplay. We can say that this is some kind of experiment, or ""test of the pen"" in new mechanics. The fighting in this game is a real test of reaction and attentiveness. You can pick the enemy for a long time and persistently. Most likely he will kill you, but it can be that you can win too. However, the main feature of battles here allows you to parry attacks, knocking down concentration and killing him by inflicting only one hit in health - a fatal hit(or two on bosses). ... And now what annoyed me or pissed me off: 1) Oscars for the most bugged bosses of all time(After so much time, many bosses can be beaten to death by corny revealing weaknesses of... developers and testers, and not the bosses themselves). Some of them were repaired, but the most - still can be used. 2) I do not know if this is a bug or such an idea, but a couple of times I have come across a wildly illogical thing, like, for example, a Shichimen in a palace hits with his beam through a mountain!!! to the other side of the water stream. 3) Periodically, the fixing on the enemy/target flies cancel. It's not f***g cool when, in the middle of a fight, you simply lose a fixed target and instead of going around him in a big arc, you suddenly start running towards his strong attack. 4) Very often the enemy ignores the **** when starting his attack. And no, it's not an enemy with resist to ****, because they work more often on that enemy, but this often happened. 5) A mini-boss ninja the sewers(where game started) - It's just disgusting spitting at the players to make a dexterous and fast mini-boss in an extremely meager room with almost opaque walls, which many players complained about in the Internet. 6) In a game with enemies as fast as diarrhea - the player swings with his attacks extremely slowly. In my subjective opinion, this done on purpose, because why the hell does a character run at the enemy to strike with a sword, and instead, pompously and slowly turns around himself, swings and only then strikes with a katana?! 7) ALWAYS! gets up after ""stealth action"". ALWAYS! And this is very dumb... every time you have to squat again. Constantly hit on the sit button if there are more then 2-3 enemies near you. 8) The game is full of rifles and arrows, but the player has no f***g one of them. I understand that the cornerstone of the game is swordsmanship and parrying, but it looks corny stupid. The character is a ninja, and they have always used everything that can be used to kill. Ok, let's not touch the noisy rifles, but the bows! ...No! ... just almost useless shurikens. 9) About useless things: among the consumables, there are also a lot of useless ones. For example, I used ceramic pieces only twice in the game, because they either fly somewhere to the side, or even close to the enemy do not give any reaction... I will call candies useless not because of their effects, but because for a short time, having only three pieces for a boss fight is not having them at all. 10) There is not enough variety in weapons, items, some talismans, and so on. Some of the skills and prostheses are almost useless in comparison with others, which makes the game even more ""narrow"" in this regard. 11) I liked the graphics in general, but I understand the criticism from people that it looks a little outdated for the year the game was released. 12) Curved hit-boxes. This does not happen often, but periodically and always makes the character a strong trip because this game is hard - the enemy can strike into the void next to you and you will receive damage. Even if the distance is EXACTLY far. ... I definitely liked the game, but damn it, all these disadvantages spoiled the impression very much. If everything would have been done normally, I am almost sure that the hardness of the game would have been perceived a little softer and more enjoyable for me.",8,2021-09-13,PC,user

OberiousLocke,"TLDR - Bloodborne, but they took out everything that made Bloodborne work, and set it in Japan, and also modelled it around the most finicky combat tactics from the Soulsborne series (namely parrying, which for some bizarre reason the fanboys try to argue is not actually a core, essential part of the gameplay loop despite being exactly that) FromSoft has continued their degeneration from tough-but-fair (Demon's Souls, mostly. Dark Souls 1, 95%) to Tough-and-****-the-player. The game plays nicely when it works, but unless you're a major masochist with hyperactive reflexes, I can't recommend it. Full text - Sekiro just doesn't do enough right to reach that same point of enjoyment. Your health is too low to start with, to the point where the first non-tutorial boss (Chained Ogre) can very easily knock off 50-75% of your health, roughly, meaning that if you take a single hit from your average enemy prior, he will kill you in one hit. Even if you live, you have a high chance of being flung off the map, which gets rid of the last of your health, making your respawn token's worthless. This is exacerbated when you reach Shinobi Hunter Eshin of Misen, who can take you from full health to dead faster than you can blink, you are given the opprotunity to pick up the Mikiri Counter combat skill, however it is damn near impossible to get it to work in the moment. This is both made worse by the fact that any attacks that result in a synced animation (grab attacks for instance) have some serious phantom range, to the point where you can dodge directly behind the Chained Ogre's lunging grab attack, and still get grabbed as the ogre yeets himself 180 degrees and grabs you anyway, the same thing can happen with Enshin. In no particular order I personally experienced multiple instances of being knocked out of the air by attacks that very clearly did not hit me and being grabbed out of the air by attacks that very clearly did not connect. I could go on about other things, about how the game can't tell if it's trying to be a fast paced action game or a stealth game, how the combat just doesn't match the game and it's difficulty in conjunction with your pitiful amounts of help, the game itself being generally misleading out or outright deceitful, like how it makes it clear early one that dodging is key, yet with most even basic enemies in the game, dodging is no guarentee that the enemy won't just spin in place like a top and hit you anyway. I could go on about how fighting more than one enemy at a time, which will happen very early on in the Hirata estate becausethe fact that enemies can see for miles is an absolute train wreck, or about how everything happens so quickly in a game that demands caution and precision making the game a miserable experience for those without the reflexes of a coked-up squirrel. In short, like Dark Souls 3, it suffers from Bloodborne syndrome, albeit to an outrageously higher degree. Fast paced combat that has no place in the game, lacking all the systems that made it work such as the Rally system. There IS an upgrade in the first technique scroll that allows to recover health on a deathblow, but that isn't going to help you because you generally don't get that many deathblows when it would be the most useful (i.e boss fights), and knowing the pitiful amount of health you get at the start, it probably would be uselss anyway. Hopefully by the time Elden Ring comes around, Miyazaki and co. will finally be over the hyper actively difficult game play that plagued Sekiro and Dark Souls 3 to a drastically lesser extent, and realize that it's just not fun having your skull caved in by relentless, artificial difficulty of homing attacks, low health at the start, and dying in 2-3 hits, and parry centered combat despite the fanboys screeching otherwise. If you're a horrendous Sadomasochist, I can see you getting mileage out of this. Otherwise, I really cannot bring myself to recommend this like I would FromSoft's previous work.",1,2021-08-09,PC,user

Smallchungus167,"Sekiro adds the posture system and making the constant attacking and pinpoint deflecting a must in every encounter - steel clashes on steel in a rhythmic, mesmerizing, and almost hypnotic manner. Another crucial element that makes this game such an enthralling experience to play is the inclusion of perilous attacks. When the enemy flashes a red kanji symbol, you have a second to determine what they're doing and how you're supposed to react accordingly: will they thrust you? Step on their weapon the moment it launches. Will they perform a sweep? Jump over the sweep and counter them with an overhead attack. Will they attempt to grab you? Dodge towards their back to give yourself a big opening. This system feels daunting at first, but I guarantee it will click with you at some point in the game, and it will feel fantastic to counter perilous attacks, something no other video game has ever done yet.",10,2021-08-07,PC,user

Skouyter21,"This is one of the best games I've played in a while. Yes it's difficult to play but the feeling of reward I got from beating bosses who I've been battling for hours(sometimes days) is so satisfying. You have to literally go into this game with the mindset of a professional boxer. There is going to be a lot of rounds to fight(expect to die a LOT)and you'll need to get good at studying your opponents, looking for weaknesses, and exploiting those weaknesses in a careful and timely manner. This game is chess not checkers. You also have to be a glutton for punishment in playing this as well. This isn't one of those games that will ask you if you want to decrease the difficulty because you keep getting manhandled by a boss or mini boss. You died? Too bad. Go back and try again. This game is THAT much of a savage. Those who gave this a 1 star review either thought it would be like something else entirely or just aren't built to tackle a truly challenging game experience.

Knindish46,Amazing game one of my favorites. Combat it beautiful and simple yet never gets tired. Prosthetics are an amazing tool and it seems like every enemy and boss has a specific counter. There are multiple skill trees and each ability you get changes your character a significant amount. Each skill changes the way you play or approach a fight. The environments in the world are amazing and really immerse you in the fantasy world. The enemy variety is very diverse and there are tons of unique enemies and the same applies to bosses. The game is very hard and there is no way to change it. But you can cheese a number of bosses if you want the game to be a little easier and I chose to do that with a couple.,10,2021-08-05,PC,user
Slackjawed390,"This the most authentic depiction of shinobi or ninja, well at least better than naruto. The game demands just one thing, attention and reflexes. In dark souls or BB your success depended on builds but here its just you and your katana. Thats all you need to master. The atmosphere, sounds, music instills such a sense of connection with the protagonist that he is easily my favourite character. And the sense of reward and achievement is unparalled. Just a lot better than souls though much tougher. Only con includes an insane learning curve . And yeah game is meant to be completed 7 times or at least 4 times.",10,2021-08-05,PC,user

Peterthefile692,"The first time was so hard I used a guide to cheese the game. Second time I actually played the game after having some experience, it's challenging: until you get the hang of the bosses moves and counter often. 3rd play through is easy: you'll have mastered countering and see how repetitive the bosses are. 4th play through was a spreed run for me. 5th run I got bored of being OP.

Makejames188,"This game has Tenchu lineage in it's blood and that's a good thing. The combat, while a very challenging and fluid affair is not the only means to take out the enemies presented to you in this huge yet dense action adventure/stealth game. THIS IS NOT DARK SOULS. Just because you have played that series or Bloodborne doesn't not mean the same mechanics and principles apply. This is a stealth action game where running away and finding ambush and vantage point to whittle down the enemies numbers rewards you more than swinging your sword till things die. This game rewards patience alot more than brazen fighting ability. As a lover of the stealth genre it's painful tio watch players stand on the top of a building with a huge vantage point that allows you to scope out the area and plan you attack just jump into the middle of four to five enemies yelling that the game is too hard. There's more than one way to play this game. I'd definitely recommend it to stealth action players and fans , not to casual Souls fans.",10,2021-08-05,PC,user

You keep grinding, keep getting hit, keep losing and dying until you figure out all the patterns, all moves and you can see how much better you become.

Jahuui6148,"Having played all dark souls games as well as Bloodborne I thought I was well prepared for Sekiro. I soon realized i was not. A lot of the mechanics seem similar yet so different. The combat system is stunning. As I never used shields in any souls game, always just grabbing the biggest weapon I could get my hands on I had a hard time getting used to deflecting. Majority of combat is deflecting attacks and boy it is satisfying to get a streak of perfect deflects. Most boss fights are so incredible that I did not mind at all getting my ass smacked over and over. Especially Owl (father), I died to him at least a dozen times yet I enjoyed every single fight. Most bosses have unique movesets and are very challenging yet beatable. Story is very engaging and despite wanting to go for the Shura ending I chose the Purification mostly because of the want to be the ""good guy"". Character dialogues hide a lot of secrets and similarly as in other FromSoft games most of the story is hidden. Most characters, including mini-bosses, have an interesting backstory worth exploring through eavesdrops, item collection and easter eggs. Death is arguably more punishing than in souls. Upon death Sekiro loses half his Sen (money) and a lot of experience. Neither is anyhow possible to regain other than gaining new. The skill system is very intricate however I found only a select few of the skills to be useful. On the other hand the prosthetic tool upgrades were one of my favourite features, however difficult it is to fully upgrade all of the **** best part about Sekiro are the bosses. Never being a fan of big bosses I was very sceptical of the Guardian Ape. I was pleasantly surprised how well done the boss is and I enjoyed it as much as all the swordfights, which are absolutely spectacular. The only bossfights I did not like were the Divine Dragon and The Folding Monkeys. Other that those two, all bosses are a masterpiece.",10,2021-06-30,PC,user

Jamie2683,"After doing the game 100% and unlocking every single achievement, i feel like i can finally make a review of it. I will list my pros and cons and then make a small comentary about it: Pros: + Game is very polished, and i did not feel like i was getting BS killed as it happened sometimes with the Dark Souls games. + Combat is more dynamic than any of the Dark Souls, and also more than bloodborne. + It has a story you can follow without reading 400 item descriptions. + ""Bonfires"" at bosses door makes it far more entertaining, as it allows you to fight them full HP and items, so you can play more agro, and it's also a LOT less infuriating when you die. + Graphics are really beautiful. I wish i had a monitor over 1080p to play this. + Defeating some bosses for the first time feels like a real achievement, not crappy ""ez mechanics"" like Storm Ruler on DS3. + Customizable controls! +Had way less "" it im leaving it here"" with this game than with any other fromsoftware title. Cons: - Once you get the parry system, it's more of a walk than anything else to be honest.Combining NG+ and NG++ i only died to bosses 3 times, doing the two longest endings, and one of them was because i ran out of battery on my controller. - It only took me 42 hours to unlock every single achievement and complete 4 runs (from ng to ng+++). - Although you have a lot of prosthetic tools and upgrades, and habilities at your disposal, if you learn to parry almost every single one of them is rendered useless.",10,2021-06-30,PC,user

Even as a seasoned Dark Souls Veteran i had some trouble with bosses but once u learn the combat of this game it feels satisfying to play.

5Naelok,"Playing Sekiro is this bizarre dance between feeling utterly helpless and completely invulnerable. You first encounter a boss and the mops the floor with you. You struggle to stay ahead of his attacks, guzzling potions and cursing as you barely manage to shave off even 25% of a health bar in there before dying. You get smashed down and murdered by the **** again and again. Then it clicks, and you've got it. You know to jump right after the fury attack, back up and then counter when he raises his blade over his left shoulder and that he's wide open if you get behind him after the sword combo. All of a sudden you're blowing through the boss' first form (or maybe two) without taking a hit. I like that feeling. It's damn hard, but I'm not getting better at fights because I leveled up my sword power, I am getting better because I have mastered these immensely complicated patterns and am weaving between them to attain victory. For it is in that gap between helplessness and invulnerability where true beauty is to be found.",10,2021-06-27,PC,user
Jinrax7524,This game is great. I came into it expecting something a kin to dark souls and while the gameplay is totally different it has the same feeling which many other souls-likes lack.

Uglzorp579,"Sekiro is what happens when you mix Tenchu with Dark Souls. You can sneak and backstab your way through most of the game but when it comes to bosses, you'll have to fight. As someone who was frustrated by certain elements of Dark Souls, I found Sekiro to be far more enjoyable. The biggest improvement is the shrine system (equivalent to the bonfires in DS). Unlike the bonfires in DS, shrines are always placed next to bosses. This greatly reduces the amount of backtracking you have to do whenever you get killed (which will happen a lot). In addition, using a shrine doesn't automatically respawn enemies unless you rest or fast travel. Finally, shrines are far more plentiful than bonfires were in DS. Throw in your grappling hook and rapid move speed and you'll never take long to get where you want to go. The bonfire system in DS always felt like it was designed to waste my time and the shrine system in Sekiro is a huge improvement.",10,2021-06-27,PC,user
PA1ker56,Such a great game and so satisfying. Unlearn the dodge/roll technique from Dark Souls/Bloodborne cause it won't help you here as this game requires mainly patience and a lot of deflecting skills. Combat is fluid and bosses are difficult but not impossible. Keep at it and it does get easier as you learn the enemy's moves and learn to utilize your tools properly. Exploration is fun and there are many ways to play the game as you aren't forced into one linear path so you can go off and do side bosses before the main bosses if you wish. Overall very fun and definitely one of the best challenging games to come out in a while.,10,2021-06-27,PC,user
Britannia11,"This game taught me the very hard way to fight masterly with the katana. Like in real life the katana here is more than just a sword; is has a soul of its own. You have to be one with it, if you want to master this game. In contrast to any Souls or Souls-like game the victory over an oppenent isn't the most rewarding, in Sekiro it is sword combat itself which has one of the best fighting systems I have ever known in a game so far. Thus, the combats against every minor or big boss are an extraordinary immersive and intensive experience. Like in a real sword duel everything ‚Äì or in other words your victory or death - depends on whether you can ‚Äûread‚Äú the movements of your opponents or not; furthermore, if you can handle your katana the perfectly right way, especially to block and parry all of your opponent's attacks in the very right moment. And if you do so, you can decide the duel in your favour in a very brief moment, so that you kill your enemy and will be victorious ‚Ä¶ or you will be dead also in just a few seconds ;). Overall a great game from From Software, which has some similarities to their previous games (Dark Souls 1-3, Bloodborne), but in its way and style it is very unique and outstanding, especially because of its exceptional duels, which will make you tensed up and sweat like in no other game before. Yes, it is quite difficult, but everyone can handle it, who has the patience and passion to try a difficult and severe situation or boss fight over and over again - even if there will be only little progress at times - and is willing to learn from his/her own mistakes.",10,2021-06-27,PC,user
TitanOfRage5,"When I heard that Sekiro wasn't going to have character customization, weapon pick ups, armor pickups, and many other features that were in other Dark Souls games. I thought the game was going to be absolutely terrible. after playing it every day for the past few days I can honestly say that I enjoy the game. ya its lacking in those features but what it lacks, it makes up for in story, combat features, and a depth of free movement that makes you feel like a stealthy badass. The game is absolutely breathtaking in its visuals and it amps up what made the Dark Souls franchise so infamous, it takes Dark Souls difficulty pisses on it and ramps it up a notch. You trembled at sister friede well wait for what the Butterfly lady has in store for you! Dark Souls always gave you a difficult first boss to rumble with before you entered the world of bend over and take it.

It's like it took all the best parts from all from games and put it into one. no dumb gimmicks like pvp, co-op, or whack rpg elements. it's a pure videogame. anyone that says sekiro is too hard and needs an easy mode is a little **** that should kill themself.

Your prosthetic arm gives you a a lot of addition tactics in battle due to the collection of gadgets you can attach to it. Also you can learn unique combos, strikes and skills. So yeah like I said pretty awesome gamplay wise. The story is nothing too spectacular but keeps you motivated. Every region has some sort of verticality for your movement with the grappling hook. Stealth makes many parts a lot easier. I think Dark Souls 1 and Bloodborne have still better regions and atmosphere but thats my opinion. I'd say this game is not as hard as Dark Souls 1 or Bloodborne due to the fact it's way fairer and stealth makes -like I said- almost every part easier except for the bosses ofc ..

KxngMikk1888,"Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, A 16th century supernatural ARPG from the legendary studio FromSoftware and mastermind Hidetaka Miyazaki, the man that gave us the phenomenal Bloodborne and Dark Souls franchise. Sekiro is based in a fictional version of 16 Century Japan where you play a Shinobi called Sekiro meaning One-Armed Wolf. The game starts with an opening cinematic about the conflict in Ashina coming to an end, You see Sekiro as a child, as a man (Owl) walks up to him and asks the ""Starving Wolf"" to join him, He trains the child ""relentlessly"" to become a master Shinobi. You start the game of in a cell pit as someone throws down the clue to your escape, this first chapter is sort of a way to help you get a feel for the game and it's controls, if your used to the typical Dark Souls gameplay you're going to have to adjust your playstyle as Sekiro is all about posture, at the bottom of the screen your posture is displayed and at the top your enemies, you have to deflect to build up posture, blocking works but not as well, you have a very small time frame to deflect so your reflexes have to be on point as that could lead to death. In previous FromSoftware games dying was the worst thing that could happening, in Sekiro they took a different approach as you can resurrect once after each death, some enemies have this as well, above their health there is a red indicator so you know how many times they can resurrect.",10,2021-06-22,PC,user
Smallbund25,"The combat is the most rewarding system I have come across to date and it just keeps pulling you in for more.

Some moves are very satisfying to pull off, like Lightning Reversal or Mid-air Deathblows, and the sound effects of deflecting just makes it all more satisfying. + The story has the most branching of any FromSoft game yet (which isn't a lot, admittedly), with some bosses being exclusive to certain choices, and one of them is the first time FromSoft has done something of the sort. + Resource scarcity is done very well, making the consumables you pick up through exploration and mini-boss killing extremely valuable. + All the encounters are designed to encourage players to use consumables instead of just hoarding them. + The big majority of the tools are good or great. + There isn't a single area that makes me think ""I don't wanna go through this annoying again"", unlike all the past FromSoft games. + Final boss forces you to use everything you've learned throughout the game while not feeling unfair. + Trademark Miyazaki-led enemy placement and usage. Unlike Dark Souls 2 and Dark Souls 3's DLC, which had Tanimura's handiwork, this game doesn't bombard you with extremely annoying waves of enemies in closed spaces that you have to bruteforce your way through with no other options or trick to the encounters. - Emblem system is annoying. I honestly wish it'd just replenish when you rested/communed at an idol and didn't require buying them. There are some times where you're banging your head against a boss encounter but you run out of emblems and gold to buy them. The system as-is does not really encourage experimentation a lot. - Most of the soundtrack is trash - which doesn't surprise me considering Yuka Kitamura composed most of it. There are a couple songs that I liked and got me in the mood, but I noticed there was a 2nd composer, and I'm willing to bet they had his hand, just like Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3. - One particular optional boss fight is terrible and ignores 90% of the combat mechanics in the game, which leaves a very bad taste in your mouth. It's a Bloodborne boss in Sekiro. It just doesn't work. - Hitboxes on grabs are (still) totally, now a problem exacerbated by the reduced iframes. Both beast bosses use these fairly often, and if a death results from a bad hitbox it can be pretty triggering. Excellent game.",10,2021-06-22,PC,user
Kikbaze360,"In a nutshell, it's part Souls part Tenchu. This is a fast-paced action-esque Souls-like game with some stealth and less emphasis on customisations and stats. On the other hand, it's a Tenchu with challenging combat plus a lot more boss fights.",10,2021-06-21,PC,user

BalliSti0X,"Sekiro is a great game that is quiet challenging even if you have beaten the souls series multiple times. The combat is very fast paced and with ""posture"" being a major player with in the system it takes some getting used to coming from two handed great swords. Parrying is another major part of the combat system and you probably wont get very far without it. Each enemy give experience points that can be used to unlock skills. Unlocking skills does make things like sneaking around and using ""Sugars"" and other items to last longer but you can certainly get through the game without spending them. I didn't use the ""special move"" skills much as they took along time to come out and i didn't find the pay off to be worth the risk. You can scroll through your inventory during combat as time is paused which is different to Dark Souls. This makes it so that you can find the item you want and use it without having to run away, scroll through your hot bar and make enough distance so you can use the item all at the same time. All in all, I think Sekiro was fun to play and very satisfying to complete but I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. I would still recommend Sekiro but don't go in thinking it's like Dark Souls because you will be disappointed.",10,2021-06-21,PC,user

Them approaching a traditional japanese setting with their own fantasy/folklore elements really delivered a special game, and this time without a convoluted story, easy-to-miss sidequests or absurd game design. They delivered an unforgiving, brutal and fast-paced samurai action tale that also happens to have the best combat and bosses across their titles. Overall, I am extremely pleased with everything, from voice acting (japanese), music, gameplay, graphics, level design, story, game length. If anything, they should work on their lipsync and models, but in the grand scheme of things, I can see why this game earned the GOTY awards it did.

MultiSapman37,"This game is difficult if you are used to playing Dark Souls-ish games as it makes you unlearn a lot of the mechanics from those games. Instead of block/rolling/continuous evasion, this game forces you to go head-on and clash the glorious nippon steel with your foes at full throttle. If you keep your block up, prepare to get punished after getting posture broken. The trick is to learn the enemies attack patterns and deflect his attacks by just blocking the instant his/her damage is about to hit you. All the other while, you need to be aggressive and target their posture meter down to get deathblows. If you consider enemies having just 2 resource bars (health and posture in sekiro instead of health and stamina from souls games), then focusing on posture breaks is what works in Sekiro.

Every boss in the game is not only an obstacle, but a learning opportunity that tests the player to see if they have mastered the skills they have learned and obtained thus far. By the end of the game, the player is faced with an all too familiar challenge that makes the players growth in their first playthrough all the more apparent and rewarding.

Frozorid19,"I hate Dark Souls. Its particular strain of sadomasochism-passing-for-gameplay has infected so many genres that all it takes for a game with clunky movement and a terrible camera to earn the adulation of credulous imbeciles (recognizable by their rallying cry ""git gud"") is to call itself ""a Souls-like"". Fortunately, Sekiro is not Dark Souls. Yes, the cameraman still attempts to perform an amateur colonoscopy whenever a large enemy backs you into a corner. And yes, even petty bandits (or frail old ladies) can combo you to death off of one mistake. However, the main difference between this game and the entirety of the Dark Souls canon is that combat is actually fun. Fluid movement, a stamina mechanic that rewards aggression, and excellent visual/sound design all make even standard enemies encounters enjoyable. The implementation of a rudimentary (yet serviceable) stealth system means that working your way back to bosses after you die never becomes unmanageably tedious. The bosses themselves are difficult but not unreasonably so (at least during the first playthrough), and while they can all be defeated ""fairly"", Sekiro provides enough tools to mercilessly cheese most of them if the player is willing to experiment. While I do have a variety of criticisms ranging from the quality of the story (""minimalist"" would be putting it generously) to the limited enemy variety (you fight 4 versions of the same miniboss) to consumable scarcity (certain enemies become very annoying or even borderline impossible to defeat without items you cannot obtain easily until late in the game), none of these are serious enough to deny my enthusiastic recommendation.",10,2021-06-19,PC,user

For the most part, though, I didn't like it for its difficulty, I liked it for the world it built. Sekiro is definitely more about combat, and (slightly) less about exploration, but combat is much tighter and exciting, and less frustrating. In the end, I found the game very fair, definitely exciting, and hard but certainly not impossible.",10,2021-06-19,PC,user
Nozoeok8,"Fast-paced, visceral, and far more realistic than previous souls games. Combat consists of breaking an enemy's posture, which means attacking them, deflecting their attacks, and other special actions. This is the big win of this game. Fighting is about rhythm. Since enemies always have the same move combos, you can detect the rhythm of their attacks while blocking, and the next time you see this, just repeat that rhythm with your deflect button. This would become boring after a while, but the perilous attacks add a little spice to the equation.

The stealth elements of Sekiro allow you to get into many positions for silent assassinations or simply explore the varied environments. The trailers never featured much stealth footage, but it is actually very stealth heavy. Players could sneak past around 95% of the game, but it would be unwise to miss out on the experience points.",10,2021-06-17,PC,user

Every single encounter is designed with rhythm and personality in mind ‚Äì once you learn a bosses pattern, you'll be able to dominate him on every following playthrough.

I only got it because one of my best friends kept recommending it to me, and although I had heard that it was hard, I had no idea how brutal it actually was. Still, I kept at it, and the moment the combat clicked, I instantly saw it in an entirely new light. The combat is fast-paced and exhilarating, and every death is just another lesson. In order to build you up into a Shinobi killing machine, Sekiro first has to break you down repeatedly. And the game scales the difficulty as you go, making sure that there's always a new challenge to throw yourself at. The graphics are absolutely beautiful, and the story is also rich and compelling. Sekrio: Shadows Die Twice is a masterpiece worthy of recognition, and anyone who is up to the challenge should play it.",10,2021-06-16,PC,user

On more serious note here are things I like about this game. Pros - Better than Dark Souls (I played every Dark Souls game) - Harder than Dark Souls. This game is more about timing your attacks. - Best sword combat I have ever seen in a game - Atmospheric. They nailed the feudal Japan feel. - Nice soundtrack - Highly replayable. There are 4 endings. Some endings will make you fight new bosses. - Great boss fights - Very polished and optimized Cons - You are not dancing right if you think there is any. 11/10 Would dance again.,10,2021-06-16,PC,user

This game makes you feel like the ultimate beast when everything clicks, I can play over and over again and never get bored,I've beat it like 50-60 times already, did several speedruns, challange runs, boss rushes, beating the game without dying, FromSoftware is truly the GOAT developers, can't wait to see what they do with Elden Ring.",10,2021-06-16,PC,user
Austicsaviant69,"+ The art-style fits the Sengoku Japan setting of the game pretty well. + Similar to From's previous games, there are checkpoints you have to search for. + Combat is pretty fun once you understand how it works. (There is a certain boss who will force you to understand how combat works. This boss is ) + Multiple endings. + Stealth in this game is fun as opposed to the boring stuff you see in other games. + Fun boss fights. + The game rewards you for exploration. + Japanese voice acting in this game is top-notch. + Lots of varied areas and enemies. You will fight humans, monkeys, monsters and more monkeys. Lots and lots of monkeys. +- The game is very fast-paced. This is alright once you get used to it but might feel too hard while playing the game for the first few hours. +- Some soundtracks were fun to listen to. Some were ""ok"". - While I like challenging games, this game felt too punishing. Getting hit two to four times while fighting bosses means you are dead. Moreover, some attacks are fast and will one-shot you which is something I haven't encountered in From's previous games. One-shots have always been clearly telegraphed in their previous games (remember Lorian's beam in DS3?) but for some reason they did not follow the same rule in this game. - It can take a long time trying to beat some bosses/mini bosses only for you to get killed for getting hit twice.

Delta98,"Having just got the final achievement at NG+4 I have to say it is one of the best games I have played. Being the huge Soulsborne fan I am this was a really refreshing take to the already polished From Software **** game takes place during the Sengoku era of Japanese history in the land of Ashina. You play as shinobi Wolf tied up in a battle over the powers of immortality whilst seeking revenge on the samurai clan who attacked you and kidnapped your lord. In comparison to previous From Software titles, the gameplay is very fast paced with a much higher focus on skill rather than stats. The game strips you of your ability to customize stats, choose between weapons and vary your build and instead creates a much more focused and well polished experience where all elements of gameplay feel much more thought out and planned; the game does not suffer the issue of ""too many weapons"" and instead allows you to vary your play only a bit in terms of combat arts. It is not for everyone. It is a very difficult beast to master and takes a lot of patience and practice. However this all pays off as the experience becomes much more rewarding when you finally master that boss you have been stuck at for hours and instead of just beating him with great stats or luck, you realize that you have learned the boss and become better at the game. This invokes a true feeling of progression and reward that just leveling cannot give. To conclude, the game is not for everyone. If you are looking for a challenging but fair experience that actually takes effort and skill to beat and not just tedious grinding, this might be the game for you. For fans of the Soulsborne series I highly recommend the game, however know that your previous experience will work against you in the start; you will have to re-adapt to this new and amazing experience.",10,2021-06-14,PC,user

Lexnextdex21,"One of the best games i've played so far. As a fan of soulsborne series i must say i love this game! It's without a doubt both easier and harder in different aspects than the previous souls games. The general enemies are easier than they have ever been because you can stealth kill everybody in the level if you choose to but then the mini bosses and actual bosses come along... They aren't the most difficult bosses but they are very challenging and there are very few options to power up and brute force your way through a boss. You can farm xp and money to buy new skills and other things but you can't raise your base stats. If you aren't sure of yourself or willing to improve you could hit a brick wall after a few hours and give up. Combat is very responsive and nearly all the problems like phantom hits, delayed actions after button presses, and unresponsive controls from the souls series have been fixed. On my 1650 at 1080p I get a solid 60fps on a mixture of max and high settings so the game runs well also much better than previous Fromsoft **** soundtrack beautifully complimented each area and encounter. It's one of the most impactful and memorable scores from their library I have played. I'm an explorer and love finding secrets. Trust me, there are tons of those as you progress and you're rewarded for going off the beaten path. So the game will most likely satisfy you about that. I also don't recommend using any guides on your first playthrough and experiencing everything first hand. Try not to get too angry when you sit back and enjoy ancient castles, bamboo forests, acid swamps, mountain side temples, forsaken villages, and more in this journey you're about to take. Also keep in mind that you will die a lot more than twice.",10,2021-06-14,PC,user

Coldrolnal7,"As someone that has poured many, many hours into the previous FromSoft titles, dying repeatedly until I was able to either get lucky or I was able to ""git gud"", I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this is the only real thing Sekiro has in common with those games. You will die. A lot. Way more than twice. Just..a lot. This is not a Soulsborne game. You are not some powerful knight capable of face-tanking every entity you come across. You are a ninja. The game will remind you constantly of this fact. You are free to play as dirty as you know the enemies will. Poison them, set them on fire, stab them in the butt when they are not looking and then Spider-Man away. Who cares! Just kill them before they kill you. If there is anything to take away from my rambling, it is simply this. You are shinobi. You are not a samurai or knight. So don't expect to play as one and you and this game will get along well!

Flound4er,"Playing through Sekiro for the first time was the greatest gaming experience of my life. Never has a game meant so much to me. Like all the Souls, this game is pure immersion--It speaks to you in every detail. And the difficulty drives you deep into the this immersive experience, where you find yourself gritting your teeth, riveted to the screen and fighting with all your might to just stay in it a little longer. To deflect and to dodge and to land just one more hit! Time and again, Sekiro had me falling out of my chair, stunned with the realization of what I must do... Twice! The resurrection mechanic just further enriches the experience, forcing you to become the ultimate shinobi master and and not only beat a boss, but completely to annihilate it... or at the very least to just barely out-live it, surviving and succeeding by the tiniest of margins. What a game! As a Souls fan (both dark souls and various other souls-like games), this game is just a treasure. It excels in areas Dark Souls cannot. Being provided with only one main weapon means makes for a finely tuned PVE combat experience that is much more immersive than the other Souls games... and you don't have any choice about it! You are forced to master these new mechanics, and quickly find yourself grappling around, sprinting, dodging, deflecting, and then destroying enemies and bosses that will leave your breathless with their magnificence.

Sergantsl1piner,"I normally don't write reviews about games especially critically acclaimed games such as this one. Sekiro, however really deserved something to be said about it. I have never been a fan of the souls series but i respect what they done for gaming and the difficulty they presented so i expected to be frustrated while figuring out the initial learning curve. The first playthrough of this game was one of the most challenging experiences I have ever had in gaming, but when I finally understood the game mechanics and practiced them i truly understood what a work of art it actually is. It reminded of actual fighting and how a split second opening can make or break a battle.",10,2021-06-14,PC,user

What an epic fight that was. Finally beat him and decided to put my excitement into a review. Love this game.",10,2021-06-14,PC,user
Beeps3,"Sekiro has an extremely brutal design philosophy that defies conventional wisdom. When I heard people complaining about the difficulty of the game and how you apparently needed to ""flawless"" bosses/memorize movesets in order to beat them, I instinctively shrugged such complaints off. Similar statements were made about all of the previous games, and they were never true.",10,2021-06-14,PC,user
Razee1,"Sekiro is not a Souls game. This can't be stressed enough. Attempt to i-frame dodge through the game and you will get your ass slapped all the way back to Lordran. While it borrows certain elements from Souls, like the checkpoint system or cryptic NPC questlines, it's pretty much its own beast. And what a beast it is. It's one of those good news, bad news situations. Good news: the days when you needed to keep an eye on your stamina for every attack, block or dodge are over. Bad news: that doesn't mean the game is any less challenging. Quite the opposite, actually. Wolfie goes down in two hits tops, and at all times he's either heavily outnumbered or he gets crushed in the health bar measuring contest. And the absence of stats, gear and online co-op means there are no shortcuts. You won't be able to overlevel, no Solaire will come to your aid. It's either nut up or shut up. Luckily, there are ways to put you at a lesser disadvantage. Sekiro features a rudimentary stealth system and enough freedom to thin out your enemies' ranks one by one. Most of the times you can clear entire areas just by being sneaky. Apparently, Sekiro started out as a Tenchu game and I totally believe it, considering how far stealth will get you. But eventually a direct confrontation will be unavoidable. And where Souls games required you to only land that one parry, Sekiro demands that you time your blocks near perfectly several times per exchange. Combat is fast, fluid and demanding enough to make you break a sweat. While the areas are open and generally well-designed, they are not exactly eyecandy. Souls games are known for their sinister beauty, but that is largely absent in Sekiro. Some areas look flat-out rough. Only rarely will you get the urge to stop and soak in the atmosphere. A missed opportunity, really. And while the environments leave room for exploration, the absence of cool gear makes it feel strangely unrewarding. Also, due to the nature of combat you will see the same instakill moves and finishers quite often. A bit of variety would have been nice. Like the player, Sekiro faces its own set of challenges. Developer From Software has been around for over three decades, but only since the release of Demon's Souls the studio has gained a larger recognition in the West. Ever since, most of their games have been Souls games either directly or in spirit. Being widely known as the developer of Souls games came with the issue that they were expected to make nothing but Souls games - a curse, if you will. Sekiro marks the first time in a while that a major From Software title branches out far enough to be called its own thing - and be accepted by a large audience. With that leap of faith out of the way, it'll be exciting to see what they will come up with next.",10,2021-06-14,PC,user

It's one of the greatest experiences gaming has to offer, overcoming the impossible, not because of an XP system or leveling up, but because you grew up as a shinobi, your skills got better, you started getting the hang of the game, you became the shinobi. + Awesome OST + Top tier gameplay + Shinobi boy + Difficult + Japanese lore, and setting, LOVE IT! + Long, but not long enough to fill the void that IT will create :( - The monk is using hax I swear - You won't find a game quite like it, so the hollow feeling will last.

Evisicrator13,"After finally beating Sekiro I only feel one emotion, satisfaction. Satisfaction that I pushed through the odds and got ""gud."" This game isn't like a Souls game, in fact its nothing like it. If people say Dark Souls is hard, then Sekiro is unbeatable. After beating Sekiro it really put into perspective how ""easy"" the souls games are. People take for granted how many tools and assist's you get throughout the souls games, magic for being able to cheese bosses, buffs to speed up kills, leveling stats to close the gap, summoning help from other players. All of these tools to help you beat any obstacle thrown at you and people still call those games hard, I was one of them, but after beating Sekiro that has all changed. Sekiro rips away all of those tools to help you succeed and leaves you with only one thing, raw skill. The only way to beat Sekiro is to familiarize yourself with the mechanics and master them. No summons to help you fight the boss, no magic to cheese from far away, just your raw skill and determination. This game will push you to the limit, it will break you over and over again until you either push past your limits, or crumble from defeat. This game will make you relearn all over again how to play, in all honesty you'd be better off playing this game before any other souls games. If you're like me and so many others that have put hundreds of hours into the souls series then you will have an especially hard time with this game. All of those hours perfecting the mechanics and getting in the play-style of playing defensively, staying back and waiting will completely and utterly ruin you with this game. This game will force you to forget all of your previous knowledge and relearn everything. If you don't master the art of deflecting, counterattacking, and taking advantage of enemies you will not be able to finish this game. But once you do master those arts, oh my lord is it satisfying. Finally hitting that moment where you perfectly deflect a bosses entire chain and get the deathblow is one of the most satisfying things I have ever done in a video game. Getting to that point where you completely and utterly destroy a boss with perfect deflects and counterattacks will never cease to make me feel like a badass. This game is a master of making you feel like you are truly good at it, as well as making you feel like you are truly god awful at it. It will test your will, and if you pass, will make you feel like you can take on anything. It's hard, but try to not go into this game thinking its going to be another Dark Souls experience, because you will be sorely mistaken and frustrated. This is not Dark Souls, this is Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and if you don't come to terms with that then you will not enjoy this game. Great game over all though, and the combat is really satisfying, performance is good but not great, try it if you like being actually challenged and tested with all of your skill.",10,2021-05-14,PC,user

24Kamspy,"I'd like to get this out there for people like me. I LOVE the Dark Souls series, but I was never any good with the parry. Straight sword and shield tank. Never even tried a parry outside of the Undead Burg I was so bad. Bloodborne wasn't even an option for me (could have been the 22fps). So I finally picked up Sekiro expecting to get demolished, but figured I'd finally try it out. I put it off for so long because I was told it's all about the parry, and I was terrible at Dark Souls parry. But guess what? It's waaay easier. Just the game as a whole. Not in a ""too easy"" way. It's still Dark Souls hard, but the parry system is much more forgiving and I'm actually pretty good at it.

Ardiffaz22,"Clashing of swords at its finest. It was a bit overwhelming in the very beginning for me (and I've never played a Souls game before) but after some time I got used to the flow. And when you get the rhythm, it becomes the dance. Fast-pacing engaging combat which requires your concentration and punishes you for your every mistake. It plays fair and teaches you to fight perfectly and if you learn your lesson it will be the most satisfying combat ever. Very fluid animations and clashing sounds which become the music. But katana is not your only weapon, you can use tons of tools fit into the prosthetic arm, both offensive and defensive. Or you can ignore them completely and only use your sword. It doesn't have the variety of customization like in an RPG, but what it has, it is made perfect. Yes, it's hard, it requires you to 'git gud', and you will die a lot and suffer. I had so much rage during some of the fights, yet I have never even considered a rage quit. The learning curve of the difficulty is quite balanced: once you start to feel comfy, it gives you another challenge. So you'll never get bored, even after beating the game: you can go for additional NG+ playthroughs and make the game harder (yes, harder). Just give up Kuro's charm and ring the demon bell ;D But besides the combat, this game has some more to offer. The stunning visuals of mountainous Japan, filled with gorgeous castles and temples, detailed armor of human warriors and fascinating creatures, which, as I suspect, are inspired by Japanese mythology. The game on the whole feels very Japanese, but it doesn't require you to know almost anything about their culture beforehand. The story is clear and quite linear, yet you can have 4 different endings. There are not so many characters, but each one of them has a story to tell. Plus some pieces of lore can be found in item descriptions and environment. If you pay attention the lore becomes more deep and complex.

MundM,"From Software managed to make yet another master piece! With a unique fresh combat system, that feels similar to Dark Souls and Bloodborne, yet, completely different so that you can't rely on your former muscle memory. This time, combat evolves around parrying your enemies attack to break their posture. The game manages to make you feel truly satisfied when over coming a mini or true boss because you've mastered his move sets and timings. The game feels too hard at times, especially towards the end, but that's only because no other game you've played before requires this kind of input. I needed 4 hours, including grinding for more attack power, until I finally beat the last boss for the first time. Now I kill him almost always on my first attempt. The game offers you subtle ways to make the game harder, in one way with an item that makes enemies hit harder, while also giving more reward, and another way is an item which, when giving away, makes your blocks (or not perfect parries), deal a little damage to you (this one is only unlocked after beating the game once and carries over even to a new save file, I guess so new players won't accidentally make the game harder than it already is). The game could use a bit more polish with some mechanics, like the special abilities and your secondary weapons, for they don't feel all useful and you might only use 2-3 of the available options (there are plenty of skills and secondary weapons, you might stick to a certain set for your play style the whole game through). Nothing negatively mentioned would be worth reducing the points for the whole game is such a great experience that nothing else could compare to it. So far, there's only one game only announced where you play a humanoid monkey, that has the looks as if it will play like Sekiro, so Sekiro holds a candle of being yet another unique master piece from the Dark Souls makers.",10,2021-04-19,PC,user

It has completely consumed my interest and become my favorite FromSoftware title to date. So what changed with my second playthrough? My attention to in game mechanics and accepting parrying as the method of playstyle. This change completely transformed the so called ""harder than souls"" format. I also made an effort to slow down and look through the world environment and discover the advantages of using the right prosthetics. Put simply, I spent more time learning what Sekiro offered rather than trying to play it like Dark Souls. Some of the Boss fights that were impossible in my first playthrough I completed in two attempts. I actually find the game easier than souls now. The lore is unreal in this game, I'm absolutely in love with the story of this game and investing in total immersion to Sekiro is what really starts to propel it forward beyond my first impressions. It has the right balance of fantasy, historical weight, and most importantly a incredible story. I suggest completely doing your homework on the story, it pays dividends. Anyway, others have said what I have. Loving this game, I've completely immersed myself in the lore. I've completely accepting playing Shinobi playstyle reminiscent to Tenchu. I'm so happy I gave this game another opportunity. I'm very happy it stands out nothing like Souls, not quite like Tenchu.

T-Opel,"This was one of the best gaming experiences I have had in a long time. It was also extremely challenging, unforgiving, and frustrating, so much so that I have actually uninstalled the game after about 10 hours, swearing to never play it again. But boy, am I glad I chickened out and started playing again. The combat is extremely satisfying once you get the hang of it, although it is still brutally unforgiving. You will die a lot and that is part of the game. Some bosses are really ridiculously powerful, but you can learn how to fight them effectively without cheesing them. It is possible, there are even people doing no-hit runs. Some tips: * buy coin purses and gain enough experience for a new skill point before every (mini)boss fight * learn how to dodge and parry properly - the timing is crucial and it results in the combat being more satisfying * in some ways Sekiro is a rhythm game, so work on studying the bosses and learning their pattern * and most importantly, do not give up like I nearly did, you would be missing out on an amazing gaming experience!",10,2021-03-14,PC,user
samstrummer90,"Sekiro es un ""Dark Souls"" centrado en una √∫nica build (la de shinobi) ambientado en la edad media japonesa. A la vez que perdemos libertad y jugabilidad a la hora de crear un personaje y definir nuestro estilo de juego, el hecho de que s√≥lo haya una clase jugable permite a los desarrolladores crear una historia, unos enemigos y unas mec√°nicas mucho m√°s complejas que Dark Souls. En mi caso, por ejemplo, jugar a Dark Souls con builds de cuerpo a cuerpo se me da francamente mal mientras que Sekiro es un juego que se me da bastante bien. Esto se debe a que las mec√°nicas de Sekiro son ultra ""fair play"" con el jugador y ponen a nuestra disposici√≥n un arsenal de habilidades, sobre todo defensivas y de sigilo, que nos permiten enfrentarnos a cualquier situaci√≥n. Sekiro es un juego que requiere de muchos m√°s reflejos y habilidad con el mando que Dark Souls pero que ofrece una experiencia de juego √∫nica y muy satisfactoria.

keredd1010,"As most people probably already know, the game is very challenging. If it's your thing to get off by bashing your head against the wall and spending hours (yes literally) fighting the same boss until you figure out the pattern and memorize it, then this game is for you. Took me about 100 hours to complete the game and I'd say about 30% of that was grinding to level up skill and 30% of it was getting my ass kicked over and over again on the boss fights. It took me like an hour to defeat the first mini boss! Spent 8 hours on a couple of bosses each. Of course this goes way quicker if you actually look up tips on how to fight the boss which I would not consider cheating because even after you know what needs to be done, executing it, is quite another story in and of itself. The story was OK but the VO acting was pretty darn good though. I am in NG+ and it seems to have very little replayability IMO. Its no Bloodborne but I would say I like it better than the Dark Souls series which I can't seem to get into as much.

aldojnt,"The game is pretty solid, but I suggest that you go in trying to completely forget everything you know and love about Dark Souls. As a lot of comments here have expressed, you'll be disappointed greatly as things like: building your own character, backtracking and getting stronger, co-op, and even efficiently dodging attacks is just basically not something you'll find here. This game's tough, I'd say the hardest of all Miyazaki games given that most of your meaningful progress is based on whether or not you are able to defeat a VERY strong boss/mini-boss, which **** in a way because I can't talk about this game with my friends because they simply couldn't keep up with the difficulty (and that's perfectly fine, no need to throw that **** cancerous and overused ""Git Gud"" meme). But if you take the time, learn the mechanics, and even realize how many weaknesses the enemies have that can be exploited to your advantage, you'll figure your way through and hopefully have a good time What really rubs me the wrong way with this game though, is that, after so many years, FromSoft still doesn't seem to be willing/capable of fixing the serious camera issues. It's particularly more noticeable with this Purple Ninja mini-boss that you'll find inside a very VERY tight spot. Your camera will go absolutely crazy, even if you stand still, this enemy has the tendency of kicking you pretty far away, into a corner, where you can hardly see ****",8,2021-02-07,PC,user
zoodle,"It's just divine, when I first entered this game, I thought that I could pass this game as well as Dark Souls, but when I entered, I was disappointed, because I was just torn, I sat on the initial warlord(second) for an hour, while knocking down the first phase from above, I reached the giant in the pads and threw. I started to pass the second time, reached Genichiro, passed it, I think finally I killed him and the last phase begins, I just deleted the game. Now I went for the third time and started again and lo and behold, I began to like it, and I really like it. All who whine that it is impassable you just need to adapt and study the enemy's attacks. I write a review right after the murder of Isshin Asin, this was the best boss fight in my entire life, I even somehow remained with 5 flasks of medicine. XD The plot is similar in structure to dark souls, the same unfriendliness, a small narrative of the plot and understanding it through objects. But the most interesting thing is that even a chip with constant rebirths and repetitions of the world. Just great!",10,2021-02-01,PC,user

Poetic item descriptions, detailed and dynamic environments, and an extraordinarily beautiful art style complement the gameplay so well, forming part of the reward of progressing through the game. The story is engaging, dialogue is well-written, and voice acting is excellent - I played with Japanese audio and would recommend it. Boss and level design are outstanding. SEKIRO is very challenging at times but, faced with determination, it is enormous fun. My heart was pounding every time I came close to beating, and eventually did beat, a difficult boss.

Alegotron,"TING CLANG TING CLANG TING CLANG TING CLANG TING CLANG. I like the game, but the sound design is straight up annoying. I find gunfire in war games to sound beefy and relatively low pitch, and even Dark Souls seemed to have a little more bass with their swordplay, maybe because it wasn't sword on sword. But in Sekiro, since parrying is the only way to win and all enemies do until you break the posture is block, TING CLANG TING CLANG TING. The sound is really high pitch and if you're wearing earphones, it gets annoying very fast. I won't fault the game for having less build variety than Souls since this isn't Souls, but TING CLANG TING CLANG TING I get it From it's realistic but it's way too loud for something that's going to happen 24/7 while you play this game. 7 tings out of clang.",7,2021-01-19,PC,user

Narkis,"J'ai eu beaucoup de mal √† me lancer, mais apr√®s 2-3 essais, j'ai enfin r√©ussi √† appr√©cier Sekiro. Un gameplay compl√®tement diff√©rent des Souls, avec la barre de posture et les d√©placements, qui sont pour moi le grand plus de Sekiro. Le grappin, le double saut, l'absence d'endurance... c'est un vrai rafra√Æchissement compar√© aux Souls. Un autre gros changement, qui fait toute la diff√©rence, c'est l'absence de comp√©tences et de changement d'√©quipement. Cela signifie qu'il n'y a pas de build : il faut donc apprendre les boss par c≈ìur. Et si on n'y arrive pas... bah c'est qu'on est nul.

takanashii,"""Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice"" to gra, kt√≥ra wzbudza mieszane uczucia. FromSoftware jest znane z tworzenia wymagajƒÖcych tytu≈Ç√≥w, a ""Sekiro"" nie jest wyjƒÖtkiem.

Devitz,"Was thinking about 6, but lets take into consideration all the things that game does wrong: - 0 build variety, thats it. Everyone just mashes the katana, prostetic tools are either OP in certain fights(eg. umbrellas) or, in most cases, completly useless and a waste of symbols. - connected to the above, but you will wear exactly the same sword and exactly the same armor(i mean, there is no armor, there is customization whatsoever) from the 1st to last minute of your gameplay - The story is simple, boring and in game only to have any incentive to push player forward. - Again, NPC quests are unfun, unrewarding and without hesitation - SKIP THEM. Basically the worst side quests system in any game you will ever play(didn't learn a thing from DS3) - music is mediocre at best and in many cases just bland and boring - THE REPETITIVENESS of mini bosses is simply disgraceful, but to also repeat 3 of the main bosses?! Then cut the game price, because most of us pay exactly for that part of your game - epic boss fights. If you ever consider buying this game, never for a full price. - game has 2 very well done zones(and one of them is the last one that, if player chooses the wrong dialogue option, will be completly skipped) - compared to Dark Souls 3 there is basically no variety of trash mobs, again laziness, game not worth the price they're asking for it - pointless mechanics like dragonrot(additional punishment for dying, like game is double kicking you in the ballsack) and unseen aid(pure downgrade from a simple but original and working souls system BASED ON RNG) - hidden boss phases, that was made with pure intention to iritate the players On the plus side: - original and challenging combat system where player actually feels like learning and making progress, even vs simple trash mobs AND REPETITIVE mini bosses. - unique japaneese atmosphere, no need to even check where is the FromSoftware studio from. In this aspect game made with love - game gives more freedom of movement than old souls games, especially vertically thanks to the grappling hook, very satisfying to use - takes very little disc space, did not encounter any technical difficulties, can be run on very old setups - it's hard, but you need to accept death as a learning process and boss mechanics that are meant to make you angry. But if you're into souls-likes, then i consider it a plus - overall combat sounds and animations are juicy, powerful and on point.

A currency that you lose on death that disappears after subsequent deaths? check. Dying being a major part of the game/story? check. Identical healing system? check. The literal exact gameplay loop from Dark Souls games? check. Extremely similar status effects? check. Identical UI? check. Respawning enemies? check. I can keep going on. I frames, memorizing enemies attacks, everything. Not every single game needs to have it's own personal niche genre.

Mytool101,"Sekiro is the best fromsoft game in my opinion. It has easily the greatest lineup of bosses out of any game not even just fromsoft. Easily has the best combat mechanics out of any game, very punishing at the start however once learned it feels so exhilarating to engage with enemies. The level design is also just amazing, with you revisiting areas and them changing alongside your play through and however far you are in the story. Not to mention Fountainhead Palace and Senpou temple are easily top 5 best visually looking areas out of any fromsoftware game. Not to mention Ashina castle well might be a perfect level with it being compact but being a perfect almost middle level and you can traverse other levels from just exploring Ashina castle. Not to mention revisiting it you can see how it changes with the things that take place in the story and overall just really cool to see, and just feels super immersive. As I said it has the strongest lineup of bosses out of any fromsoft game and the finale is definitely a highlight. One of the toughest bosses out of any game however it plays so well and no death seems undeserved. Not to mention the spectacle of the fight is just unmatched, easily the best fromsoft boss of all time and it‚Äôs really not close in my opinion. This game is definitely a tough game especially in the beginning, however once you get used to the combat you get **** into the game, and the gameplay loop is just so addicting that this game is an easy 10/10",10,2024-05-25,PC,user

Zski,"To start with my history with Souls games. I never liked any of them, at all, until Elden Ring, which I absolutely loved. I read that the next most accessible game is Sekiro, so after my great experience with Elden Ring, I decided to give this one a shot.I‚Äôll start with the positives. The story/lore is a bit confusing but highly intriguing. Since I now understand how the story works in these games, I can appreciate what is being presented, especially since it‚Äôs a bit more active story telling compared to Elden Ring. The way they weave the story and lore into the atmosphere of the game is excellent, which really plays into the overall presentation of the setting. The graphics are very good, although nothing memorable. Mix that with a soundtrack that does the job exceptionally well despite not being memorable in any way, and it‚Äôs a great feeling **** issue, as it always was with Souls games, is the combat. I‚Äôm still having the same experience I always had with these games where I feel that the control of the character is just too loose. The slightest movement of the stick makes your character completely pivot all over the place, luckily the lock on mechanic makes it feel a little more grounded, but I hate to say it, the control of the character feels cheap. It almost feels dated, like a PS2 era game. I thought the hookshot and the prosthetic weapons work well and really enhance maneuverability compared to other games I played, but when that‚Äôs combined with the floaty controls, it feels like you have no weight in any of your actions. So I have mixed feelings about it - the maneuverability makes it feel more action based, which ironically sets up the stealth, but the way you‚Äôre forced to use it makes it lame. Maybe I‚Äôm not understanding, but the 1 on 1 fights are fun, it can be fun learning the patterns. Despite dying over and over, those segments were fun enough to give me that feeling where I knew what I did wrong, and immediately go into trying the fight again. But when there are more than one enemy present, the combat completely falls apart. It just feels like you back up a little, isolate an enemy and damage them a little bit until the group catches up, back up a little, isolate an enemy, then rinse wash and repeat.After about 6 hours with the game, I find that it‚Äôs time for me to put the game down. It has its moments, but I find that I spend a lot of mental energy convincing myself that it‚Äôs not that bad. If I spend most of my time with a game convincing myself that I‚Äôm having fun, it‚Äôs not really that fun. I can see how people enjoy it, but it‚Äôs just not for me. I gave it my best, and the weird loose grip of the character and floaty movement combined with decent combat made it hard to feel like I care enough to go on.",6,2023-10-11,PC,user

Avey123Avey,"What makes Sekiro my favourite FromSoft game is the more condencsed focus in the combat system. Gone are the RPG mechanics and hundreds of equipment pieces. Instead the game aims to create a superior battle system that still plays to the FromSoft trope of memorizing opponets movements and timings. In most fromsoft games the combat feels very turnbased. You wait for the enemy to complete their strings of attacks and when an opening occurs you make an attack. Even with all of the builds and options most players ultimately fall into this same motion. Sekiro is very much the same however instead of your only defensive option being to dodge roll and block, this game adds a whole host of engaging defensive options. Enemies can have seemingly endless strings and still be a blast to engage with due to how much more fun the combat system is for this kind of gameplay. Additionally this game makes mastering its combat system feel so much more rewarding and satisfying with the constant feedback you are given in combat, each succesful parry brings you closer to victory in a way dodge rolls simply don't. That being said there are some elements of this game that feel as though they are fairly halfbaked. The dragonrot and death system as a whole is pretty meaningless, and the means by which you engage with it are far less meaningful. The soul recovery system in dark souls actually tangibly effects your moment-to-moment descision making, where I feel its easy to forget you lose anything in Sekiro for dying due to the skill tree barely mattering. I feel the game may have been better suited by simply stripping out all rpg mechanics. Overall this is a brillant action game that may disappoint fans expecting something like darks souls. If the part you liked about previous Fromsoft games was the rpg elements and the build theorycrafting, Sekiro may not be for you. If on the other hand you liked mastering enemy strings and tough boss encounters then I cannot reccomend this game strongly enough.",9,2023-08-28,PC,user

erfunfazli,"The game has no specific story. I really don't like any design in the game from the characters designs and most of locations. Also the main protagonist is not cool. Fighting gameplay is not bad but after sometime it gets boring especially in boss fights, most of bosses are very similar it seems they have copied and pasted many bosses. boss fight are awful because you have to play and play many times to defeat them and also they are really boring because you have to dodge and deflect many times and wait for some situation to hit them. The game has no customization and upgrades are really not cool. I give it 6 only because of acceptable fighting gameplay",6,2023-08-08,PC,user
drujd,"Probably the hardest / most hardcore game from Fromsoft I've played (played everything since PS3 Demon's Souls) - especially if your reaction time tends to be higher. But the blood and pain is absolutely worth it! By far the most beautiful and colourful world they managed to create (and I played this _after_ Elden Ring), although comparatively to their latest opus magnum, it is certainly small and compact. Not sure if I am a big fan of the mechanics / combat system, but as a one-time refreshment from the typical Soulsborne formula, it certainly works. Hesitate, and you lose!",9,2023-08-08,PC,user
Jonny123,"For me this is the worst From Soft title. Still a great game but I didn't enjoy it enough. My main problem with this kind of game was the reactive gameplay that can be repetitive. But I think I might need to play it again at some point and be more aggressive so the problem might be on the user end. My first thought were that this game has quite a few strong points but overall it feels and plays like a lot of work and even when doing good I hardly enjoyed playing it (despite feeling a sense of addiction - in a bad way). Let's start with the strongest points: - solid graphics that really fit the setting - very smooth controls and motion - grappling hook and stealth aspects are fun - interesting posture / swordfighting mechanics - some encounters are quite remarkable (for example the giant ape) I can accept a game being a challenge and forcing you to take it serious. The problem is that too much things related to gameplay in this game feels like it was made to be as annoying as possible on purpose - and is also quite repetitive because the game is forcing you to play in a certain way and do it all over again too many times. Also the game is lacking a lot of basic modern gaming features. I guess the high rating can only be considered fair if you keep in mind this a niche product for a certain audience with a lot of time and willpower that they don't need to put into more important tasks. For anyone else I recommend to play other, more accessible and fun games. In the end I can't fully accept this ""niche argument"" for a good rating though - as there is a huge problem with this approach. I'll give an example: Even if your not a fan of sports games you could still enjoy playing a top sports title. However this game is simply not enjoyable without some masochistic tendencies and the willingness to succumb to ""outdated"" gaming philosophies (hidden mechanics, no proper explanations or directions, no quest logs, no map, no difficulty settings etc). I feel sekiro would have profited a lot from more fun and user friendly / accessibility / comfort elements because the stealth, movement and parry aspects would be a very solid core with a more user friendly design policy. I think this game is slightly overtuned (the character is a bit too fragile) so giving the user a difficulty option would have made it a lot more accessible. So if your not sure about yourself being part of the target audience I would consider skipping this experience. However... if your willing to get into this game and have the means to beat it can be a very intense experience. It gave me some very unique and rewarding experiences but overall felt it wasn't worth all the trouble. I kinda hope for a Sekiro 2 with the option to have a slightly more casual friendly experience. On hindsight Sekiro was overall a too annoying experience so I feel I kinda wasted time on something that was taking a lot and giving too little.",8,2023-07-29,PC,user

Boring and repetitive. There is no opportunity in game, where u can upgrade your character to the point, when 5 identic mobs, which are useless alone can chain hit you and you die instantly. There is no rolling to dodge, parrying doesn't work, when you encounter many enemies at once. I don't know what exactly smoked creators of this game, but it was not good.

zSh4dow_,"Full From Software style but for the first time a truly solid and well-functioning game in its mechanics. The combat system is certainly the thing that stands out the most, the posture and deflection system intrinsically changes the gameplay of the game, differentiating it widely from the older Dark Souls or Bloodborne. For the first time, with rare exceptions, I didn't complain about hitboxes, which in their previous works seemed designed by visually impaired people... they probably have hired more capable developers. The game is objectively difficult, deliberately bastard, but surprisingly easy to understand. Many enemies will test you, but once you understand the moveset it will be downhill. And this is obviously in line with the souls-like trend. Much more action and less RPG, even if it comes with some features in line with the genre. Sekiro certainly has less replay value as you won't be able to make any particular builds, the protagonist is a Shinobi and his weapon will remain the same from start to finish.",9,2023-06-02,PC,user

Honest-Review,"The biggest issue I have with Sekiro is that it demands perfection from the player, yet punishes them for even the slightest misstep. The game's combat system is incredibly unforgiving, with enemies dealing massive damage with every hit and the player being forced to dodge and parry with split-second precision. This would be fine if the game's hit detection and controls were up to par, but unfortunately, they are not. Too often, I found myself dying because of bad hit detection or clunky controls. Sometimes, I would dodge an attack only to be hit anyway because the game didn't register my movement correctly. Other times, I would try to jump over an obstacle, only to get stuck on it and take damage from an enemy. These issues are frustrating enough on their own, but when combined with the game's punishing difficulty, they make for an experience that is more aggravating than enjoyable. Furthermore, while the game's story and world-building are certainly impressive, I found that they were often overshadowed by the game's difficulty. Instead of being able to fully immerse myself in the game's lore and characters, I was constantly stressed out about the next fight and whether or not I would be able to survive it. In conclusion, while I can see why some people might enjoy Sekiro's challenging gameplay, I personally find it to be a bad game due to its demanding nature and flawed mechanics. I hope that future games in the same vein will learn from Sekiro's mistakes and provide a more balanced and enjoyable experience for players.",3,2023-04-28,PC,user

skdcraw,"Hesitation is defeat. Frankly, I had high expectations from Sekiro. And it fully met my expectations. First of all, Sekiro is a great looking game. I must say that he used the famous Japanese aesthetic very well. The game seems to have put landscapes at certain points for us to see and say wow. So the scenery is plentiful in the game. But other than that, it's kind of like the same thing. But I'm not saying the whole game is like that, it's like the game feels a bit like we're in the same place. It's not just about having to come to the same place 3 different times. Although they are different places, they look like the same places and are not very characteristic regions. For example, if you show me a picture from Dark Souls, I will immediately tell you where it is. But this game. Especially those roofs. After a while, the whole game feels like you're walking on these roofs. However, this does not mean that there are no different places in the game. There are some beautiful places like Hirata Estate where you go back to the past, Sunken Valley where you fight a snake, and Fountainhead Palace, which has a very nice atmosphere. However, for some reason, the game seemed a little small to me. The sounds of the game are great. Just the deflect sound makes this game great. The sounds of the sword were constantly encouraging me to play more. The music is also wonderful. Although I don't like the ambient music of the regions and I don't find it characteristic, the music of the bosses will definitely be engraved in your mind because they are beautiful (and you die a lot). So how is the story of the game? It's more open than Dark Souls, but just as closed. What does it mean? That is to say, there is no abstract universe that is difficult to understand. There are people, there is war, we are in Japan. So far, it's clear. But the details of the story, what is going on, are still not clearly explained to you. You are asked to collect from right to left. Actually, I'm not against games telling their stories like this. However, after playing games such as God of War, which tells its story in a very beautiful and cinematic way, I started to wonder if this cryptic game narration is a deficiency. My criticism in this regard is as follows: At least, it would be better if the part of the game that tells the main plot of the game was explained to us clearly, if we want to gain more lore information, we can learn them by collecting items from right to left, as DS do. But playing without knowing the main plot ****, or making an extra effort to know it, seems not quite right, but I will not comment on this. Personally, I like such statements, but when we look at it, maybe it's a bit of escapism. I don't know, I'm undecided. So what is this game about? Despite the beautiful stories of the characters in the game, I could not understand the message we should get from this journey, although I do not know how much I understood. So yes, the stories we hear from right to left are beautiful, but is ours also beautiful? We do what a girl says. I later learned that there was an important choice that we had to make in the game and it directly affected the game. But since I didn't understand what it was, I immediately made a simple choice. Gameplay is where Sekiro shines. No matter what anyone says, I don't remember seeing such a good kombat in any game. Plus it's so simple. Attack, block or dodge. Or use one of the prosthetic features. But watching them is not enough to understand how enjoyable they are. You must play. First you have to say, ""This boss is impossible to kill. He won't let me hit him. How do I know if I'm going to jump when the red mark comes out, am I going to counter with Mikiri?"" Half an hour after saying that, when you kill the same Boss without taking damage, you realize that there is no problem with the Boss, and when you learn that you played badly, you realize how easy it is. That's what happens most of the time. The feeling of satisfaction when you act like a surgeon and do everything you need to do is indescribable. And the good thing about it is that you learn that. The game doesn't send you enemies just to beat you like every game, it sends you to hit your head. E hits your head. But then when he finds out and you hit him on the head... It's a great feeling. Actually, that's the whole Dark Souls logic, but Sekiro is a little different. Because this game is not an RPG. You can't get stronger and come back and pass the boss comfortably. You have to act on your own ability. I would like to add a little advice to this part, if you want to improve your game and have more fun, always stand in front of your enemy. Don't run away and hit, just run to get health. Deflect everything and hit at every gap. Even if it is difficult at first, it makes the game more enjoyable and easier after you get used to it.",8,2023-04-26,PC,user

Bushido_DZ95,"The most stylish soulslike combat system. Unlike the recent release of ""Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty"", Sekiro clearly shows the animations and the blows themselves. It is a pity that Hidetaka Miyazaki did not develop this combat system further. The game was completed about 8-9 times and every time it was a pleasure to return to the game. The story and atmosphere are good. The most amazing thing is that the music is very boring.. in other Miyazaki games the music is just great and I still listen to many tracks, but in Sekiro there is not a single memorable track.",9,2023-03-12,PC,user
TheW4tchT0wer,"I'll give it a couple points for art design. Combat is terrible when coupled with obvious developer bugs (e.g. controller input lag and dropped/unregistered inputs. Curious how it only happens in From Software games and no others....). Sekiro dials up the From Software 'sunk cost' illogic of its fanbase to 12. 'Just keep at it until you git gud' except the combat is centered around these scripted death animations where the camera goes cinematic and then back to normal every few seconds when fighting a large number of enemies. How about instead, just let me fight all the enemies and kill them like a normal action game without the Alice in Wonderland syndrome? I gave it a few hours to see what the hype was all about. It should be a textbook lesson in poor game design that should be avoided at all costs with its counterpoint being Ninja Gaiden Black about what to strive for in a great action game.",2,2023-03-10,PC,user
dante0615,"This game tells a story about a ninja/shinobi in ancient Japan. If you are bored with other games, sekiro might be your choice. It's extremely hard. Here's my advice before playing, I hope it can help anyone. First, don't use pirated versions but buy one. Although sekiro can be played offline, but online versions of those soulsborne games contain a funny function: you can see other players' shadows, their reaction, and their words for other players. They indicated the right path for you, as well as the locations of some easter eggs and rare items Second, in order to get rid of spoilers, don't search it on youtube or Reddit. Sekiro's story was not amazing but the enemy's design is impressive. The way they appear, and change phases, I'm sure it will shock everyone on their first play. Then, enjoy your fight. Sekiro had a unique ability to resurrection which give you another chance to continue your fight when you failed. However, the game is still super hard. When your character died, you will lose half of your money and exp but your level will be kept. And the power of sekiro is based on taking others' power, so the more times your resurrection, the weaker the NPC will be. They even will be ill so you can't interact with them. Important NPCs such as the businessman's illness won't stop his trade, So the illness won't stop the extension of the main story. If you are afraid of death punishments, you can use a trainer like me. Different from other games, the player grows in the game as well as the character. When you are familiar with the enemy's move, you will enjoy the combat and know the joy of the game. Remeber, hesitation is defeat.",9,2023-03-03,PC,user
TobiCaig19,"Sekiro: Sadows Die Twice es el primer juego de este tipo que he probado, y tengo que decir que ha sido una maravillosa experiencia. Jam√°s hab√≠a jugado un souls pensando que ese tipo de juegos no era para m√≠: morir una y otra vez hasta aprenderte los combos del enemigo y, finalmente derrotarlo; sin embargo, he de decir que ha sido extremadamente satisfactorio. El juego, sobre todo al principio, es muy complicado y a medida que vas avanzando en la historia, la cual es muy digna, y profundizas en el sistema de combate te das cuenta del maravilloso trabajo que ha hecho FromSoftware implementando un sistema de parry que cuando lo ""dominas"" es un aut√©ntico deleite audiovisual. Puntos positivos: Una historia bien escrita que da pie a que haya una futura secuela. Un sistema de combate muy satisfactorio, combinado con el uso de las diferentes herramientas shinobi. Un apartado art√≠stico fabuloso. NG+ para los amantes de un desaf√≠o a√∫n mayor. Puntos negativos: Unos gr√°ficos son mejorables. La c√°mara, que en ocasiones te deja vendido y te cagas en todo. El no poder usar varias habilidades en un mismo combate sin interrumpir la batalla (para cambiar de movimientos tienes que ir al men√∫ y cambiarlo manualmente, cosa que desaprovecha, en mi opini√≥n, la variedad de movientos que te ofrece el juego. No poder luchar contra el miniboss que te apetezca una vez pasado el juego, as√≠ como ocurre con los jefes. En conclusi√≥n, es un antes y un despu√©s en mi experiencia jugando videojuegos. Esa sensaci√≥n de estar 5h con un boss y vencerlo al fin es sencillamente maravilloso. ¬°BRAVO!",9,2023-03-01,PC,user

Narrative 8/10 Characters 9/10 Graphics 7/10 World 9/10 Gameplay 10/10 - The combat is perfect. Hard, but perfect. Usually, when you play a game you feel that you are stronger than normal enemies and weaker than bosses. In Sekiro you feel equal to all of them. All the enemies can kill you 1vs1. But also, you don't need to run and wait for a window to attack a boss because you are as strong as him. - The gameplay is not based on farming and getting stronger. You can farm but is not going to make a difference. You have to know your enemy and your character. You have to know how to fight. And the sword fights are incredible. - The story and characters are fine, it's clear, linear, and kind of interesting (more if you love the japan culture). - The world is great.

itsoskej,"Sekiro is the best FromSoftware game to date. We cannot compare Sekiro to any other FromSoftware, or even any other action game in history, because it‚Äôs the other way around. This game is a benchmark that people can use to compare other action games to. FromSoftware certainly took different approach to this game than to any other souls so far. While their games are not well known for STORY, their lore, worldbuilding and environmental storytelling are one of the best in the industry. The different approach we‚Äôre talking about in Sekiro is that FromSoftware picked more straightforward, western storytelling with subtle hints to past events creating the environment that we find ourselves in while playing the game, just enough to understand the situation we‚Äôre in. The mission is pretty simple, doing what our master, Kuro, wants us to do. And he wants us to find a way to severe his immortality. The journey to accomplish that, however, is full of hardships‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶and that is where Sekiro shines the most. The journey, the gameplay is so polished it leaves other action games in dirt, and continues to do so for 3 years at the time of this review. On paper Sekiros combat is pretty simple. Move around, jump, break poise (with help of tools, if needed), deflect/parry and that‚Äôs about it. However to combine everything together and utilize in the most efficient way to get through the bosses is no easy task. In comparison, Dark Souls I is turn-based game. Enemies will not wait for you here, and it‚Äôs either you who loses footing, or them. There‚Äôs plenty ways to be humbled, and the best one, per usual, are the bosses. Every single one of them cutting your brain out to, and then perform operation reconstructing your whole nervous system to achieve Post-traumatic stress disorder every time you hear them reintroducing themselves for 70th time this day when you step into their boss arena. Boss encounters in this videogame are something you come back to leter on, especially with gauntlet of strength that lets you face them every time you think you‚Äôre ready to be bullied by them again and again. This game, in comparison to Dark Souls series, is especially hard, because essentially there is no help outside of getting better at it. There are no summons, there is no cheese (almost), there is no overpowered equipment you can use to make it easier, there is no leveling vigor, strength or dex. You‚Äôre on your, and the credits should be something everyone sees.",9,2023-01-02,PC,user

maluigario,"TL;DR: Blazing fast combat with an emphasis on stealth and parrying in feudal Japan make this a fun, though sometimes frustrating, game. There's a reason SoulsBorne isn't usually called SoulSekiroBorne: This game shares little in terms of core mechanics with any of the other games in FromSoftware's action-adventure lineup. The combat is incredibly fast-paced; none of the skills you learned in the other Souls titles will help you here. You focus more on depleting an enemy's stamina by perfectly parrying their attacks than you worry about depleting their health, as an enemy with an empty stamina guage is left open for a death blow. Sneaking and verticality also feature as core mechanics. One of the big cons in Sekiro is that the emphasis on parrying can make the process of tackling bosses feel more daunting as you try to perfectly learn their attack patterns. While a SoulsBorne game give you dodging, shielding, and parry/riposte as defensive maneuvers, Sekiro's only defense is the parry mechanic. This means advancing the battle requires perfect parries to deplete their stamina; there is almost no way to use hit and run or make a ""heavy-strength build"" that focuses on dealing damage. This can mke the process of learning the bosses attack patterns feel daunting as you keep dying, and you can't ""panic parry"" your way to victory. The other drawback compared to other SoulsBorne titles is the lack of replayability. The game has a New Game+, but playing the game again offers little variation upon return. There are no ""new builds"" for you to try; you have your one weapon, and you invest your upgrades on Shinobi Tools you mostly won't use and Shinobi Arts that I personally got almost no use out of. Even with its drawbacks, Sekiro is a stand-out title. The combat is fun and a nice change of pace from FromSoft's other titles. It's a breath of fresh air that's absolutely worth your time.",8,2022-12-07,PC,user

Add to this the extremely good bosses and enemy encounters and the end result is hands down the best combat in any game.

The level design, lore, atmosphere, and nonlinearity are good but don't reach anywhere near DS1 levels.

MagicManEivor,"This is a really, really good game. And here's why. The combat, unlike what everyone says, is fast paced, tense and never gets boring thanks to a barrage of interesting bosses and enemy types. As you unlock new skills, new tools, new ninjitu and shinobi arts, you get a lot more freedom in how you approach the game. The game feels good to play with great controls and an expanded movement. You can jump like you're on Saturn and sneak kill a guy, then run up to a mini boss and get him from the back for an easy 1 phase down. The graphics are great. I'm not usually into realistic graphics, I usually prefer a unique artstyle to feel different but I think it works here. The enemies all look and feel different and thanks to that the ways to approach are different too. The world varies in look and feel and is really immersive. The story is also great. I love easy to follow stories that have tons of lore behind them and this game didn't disappoint. It tells a rich story that I fell in love with. Now, onto the bad. The camera is really good anywhere, apart from bosses in small, enclosed areas. The bosses get reused often with one or two different attacks. And the worst thing about this game, and most fs games (from what I heard about) is that they expect you to know what to do. I felt like searching up a guide is nessecary in many parts.

CoolBR,"As a Souls series veteran, I was really surprised by how good is the gameplay of this game.

The story when I played I really liked but after that, I forgot. It has some good plot twists but is a forgettable story because you don't have the same attachment to the characters as the games with really good stories that work on the characters that build up your attachment over time, like Atreus and Kratos relationship on God of War or the relationship among Arthur and his gang on RDR2. Here in Sekiro, I don't know exactly the protagonist and his Master (Kuro) and the game doesn't build up either, so the plot twists are cool, the story is cool but is forgettable because you don't really like the characters.",9,2022-07-08,PC,user

ErayTellezi,"M√ºthi≈ü, combat tatmini olarak oynadƒ±klarƒ±mƒ±n en iyilerinden birisi ve kesinlikle oynadƒ±ƒüƒ±m en zor oyun. Final boss'u yenmem 7 saatimi aldƒ± ve ancak cheese'leyerek, namert√ße d√∂v√º≈üerek kesebildim. Ancak bundan √∂nce oynadƒ±ƒüƒ±m tek soulslike oyun olan Bloodborne'la kƒ±yaslayacak olursak bazƒ± eksileri yok deƒüil. En b√ºy√ºk eksisi atmosferi. Bloodborne oynarken adƒ±m ba≈üƒ± nasƒ±l ilgin√ß yaratƒ±klar kar≈üƒ±ma √ßƒ±kacak, ne bi√ßim mekanlara gireceƒüiz diye korka korka ve b√ºy√ºk bir merak i√ßerisinde oynuyordum. Sekiro'nun elbette b√∂yle bir amacƒ± yok ama beni kendisine hayran bƒ±rakacak bir atmosfer sunamadƒ±. Oyunun ana d√∂v√º≈ü mekaniƒüi parry. D√º≈üman saldƒ±rƒ±larƒ±nƒ± son anda kƒ±lƒ±cƒ±nƒ±zla blocklayarak dayanƒ±klƒ±lƒ±ƒüƒ±nƒ± bitirmeye √ßalƒ±≈üƒ±yorsunuz. Dayanƒ±klƒ±lƒ±ƒüƒ± bitince de tek yiyor zaten. D√º≈üman ve onlarƒ±n saldƒ±rƒ± ≈üemalarƒ±nƒ±n √ße≈üitliliƒüi g√∂z √∂n√ºne alƒ±ndƒ±ƒüƒ±nda bu i≈ü o kadar da kolay deƒüil. Parry'yi erken yaparsanƒ±z sizin dayanƒ±klƒ±lƒ±ƒüƒ±nƒ±z normalden √ßok daha fazla gidiyor. Ge√ß kalƒ±rsanƒ±z da canƒ±nƒ±z. Parry Bloodborne'da √ßok opsiyoneldi ve yapmasƒ± ger√ßekten zordu, boss sava≈ülarƒ±nda neredeyse hi√ßbir i≈üe yaramƒ±yordu. Parry yapmadan Bloodborne √ßok rahat biter ancak Sekiro'da m√ºmk√ºn deƒüil, oyunun direk temel d√∂v√º≈ü mekaniƒüi. Ki bir savunma hareketinin temel d√∂v√º≈ü mekaniƒüi olmasƒ± biraz ilgin√ß. Ancak ger√ßekten de Sekiro'da savunma yaparak d√º≈ümanlarƒ±nƒ±zƒ± yeniyorsunuz. Neredeyse her zaman d√º≈ümanlarƒ±nƒ±zƒ±n canlarƒ±ndan √∂nce dayanƒ±klƒ±lƒ±klarƒ± bitiyor. Oyunda sadece bir tane temel silahƒ±mƒ±z var. Protez kolunuzu benim gibi sƒ±klƒ±kla kullanmƒ±yorsanƒ±z bu durumun d√∂v√º≈ülerin tekd√ºze ge√ßmesine neden olduƒüunu d√º≈ü√ºnebilirsiniz ama deƒüil. Zira Bloodborne'un da y√ºzde 80'ini tek kƒ±lƒ±√ßla oynadƒ±m ve bunun gibi onun da d√º≈üman ve o d√º≈ümanlarƒ±n pattern √ße≈üitliliƒüi vardƒ±. Bu sayede tek kƒ±lƒ±√ßla oynamanƒ±n eksisi hi√ß hissedilmiyor. Kaldƒ± ki protez kolla yapƒ±labilen bir√ßok ≈üey var. Bunlarƒ± dilediƒüiniz gibi √ße≈üitli kullanabilirsiniz. Bunun yanƒ±nda yetenek puanƒ±yla geli≈üen, oynayƒ±≈üƒ±nƒ±zƒ± o kadar derinden etkilemese de bir ka√ß √ße≈üitlilik saƒülayan skilleriniz var. Bunlarƒ± protez kolla beraber kullanabileceƒüiniz combo'lar yaratabiliyorsunuz. Oyunda √ßok sayƒ±da boss ve mini boss var. Miniboss'larƒ±n √ßoƒüu ve boss'larƒ±n da 1-2 tanesi kendisini tekrar ediyor. Ancak bunun bir sorun olduƒüunu s√∂yleyemem. √ñzellikle seven ashina spears mini boss'unun beni √ßoƒüu ana boss'tan daha √ßok zorladƒ±ƒüƒ±nƒ± s√∂ylemeliyim. En √ßok zorlandƒ±ƒüƒ±m boss'lar ise isshin sword saint ve guardian ape oldu. Son boss'u elbet keseceƒüim belliydi, sonu√ßta oraya kadar gelmi≈üim bƒ±rakmak olmaz ama guardian ape'te bir ara rage quit attƒ±m ve hile a√ßmayƒ± d√º≈ü√ºnd√ºm. Bari etrafƒ± gezeyim dedim ve mortal blade'i buldum. Ger√ßekten onurumu ****. √ñlmek ve onun cezalandƒ±rƒ±lmasƒ±nda da farklƒ±lƒ±klar var. Bir kere tekrar doƒüabiliyorsunuz. Bunun yanƒ±nda can iksirleriniz kendiliƒüinden yenileniyor. Bu da Bloodborne'daki gibi tekrar tekrar √∂ld√ºƒü√ºn√ºz boss sava≈ülarƒ±na ara verip can iksiri satƒ±n almaya yetecek para biriktirmek i√ßin grind yapmanƒ±zƒ± engelliyor. Ancak Sekiro'da √∂lmek paranƒ±zƒ±n ve tecr√ºbe puanƒ±nƒ±zƒ±n bir kƒ±smƒ±nƒ±n temelli gitmesi anlamƒ±na geliyor. Bir de √∂ld√ºk√ße hastalƒ±k yayƒ±lƒ±yor ve hastalanan npc'lerle konu≈üamƒ±yorsunuz. Sekiro, Bloodborne'a g√∂re bir tƒ±k daha fazla hikaye anlatƒ±yor. Kim kimdir, amacƒ± nedir biraz daha anlƒ±yorsunuz ama normal oyunlardaki gibi apa√ßƒ±klƒ±k yine yok. Sekiro en zoruydu dedim ama o kadar da emin deƒüilim. Ne olursa olsun bu oyunda kendini korumanƒ±n birden √ßok y√∂ntemi var. Hi√ßbir ≈üey yapamasan block'luyorsun. Bir de bu oyuna alƒ±≈ümak Bloodborne'dan daha kolay geldi bana. ƒ∞kinci souls oyunum olduƒüundan ya da parry mantƒ±ƒüƒ± √ßok benzer olan Ghost of Tsushima'yƒ± yeni oynadƒ±ƒüƒ±mdan olabilir. Neyse sonu√ßta bir zamanlar hayatta oynayamam dediƒüim iki oyunu bitirdim. Keyifliydi. Bloodborne'da eksikliƒüini √ßok hissettiƒüim √∂ld√ºrd√ºƒü√ºn boss'larla tekrar kapƒ±≈üma √∂zelliƒüi Sekiro'da var ama tekrar d√∂v√º≈ümek istediƒüim bir boss (biri hari√ß) olmadƒ±.

Combat was different, hard in another way but looked amazing, japanese setting, amazing, graphics just awsome, japanese voices? Holy **** i'm in.... How hard is it?

If you're willing to take on the challenge of this souls game, you'll be met with an exciting array of bosses and enemies in-between, where the action will force you to become acquainted with its dance-like duels.

Jabbawockee,"I've yet to play all From Soft titles, but out of the ones I have had a chance to play, Sekiro is my favorite. Its gameplay is sufficiently different from the Souls games through its emphasis on parrying that it forced me to ""git gud"" all over again, even after just coming off Dark Souls III. I find the setting, story and word design more appealing in Sekiro than the normal lack of color found in the other Souls games. While some found the more linear design of Sekiro to be a detriment, I found it easier to engage with than the overly-complex RPG elements of the other titles, making it seem, at least to me, that the bosses and encounters were more approachable and curated - which significantly cut down on the grind game that was somewhat prominent other titles.",9,2022-05-06,PC,user

Tux89,"Absolute masterpiece. I bought Sekiro after playing Elden Ring, wondering if their other games are possibly as good as Elden Ring. It was quite a shock when I realised Elden Ring is the ""bad game"". Not in general, but in this context for sure. Sekiro beats Elden Ring in nearly every regard (that matters to me personally), with better controls, fast, but skillful combat, unique interesting bosses and refined difficulty - no, in this game you don't get to overlevel and cheese your way to the ending, this is actual ""git gud"" game :D. And this is not meant to be punishment to the player, this is actually what makes the game rewarding. The feeling after beating last boss in Sekiro and beating last boss in Elden Ring is incomparable. Even outside of this scope, where I mostly compare Sekiro to the latest From Software game, Sekiro still dominates. I played UNHEALTHY amount of games in my life and few I'd rate as high as this one.",10,2022-03-24,PC,user

Somy,"Sekiro is legitimately one of the most unique and breathtaking experiences I have ever had in gaming, full stop. The setting of Sengoku-era Japan is quite uniquely-presented, and it almost felt like this was FromSoft's ode to their home country with how much love they put into the design of the areas. The atmosphere is simply amazing. The combat is the most unique that I've seen, and it differs dramatically from other FromSoft games as well as most games on the market. Instead of whittling down a massive health bar, Sekiro demands precise aggression to break the opponent's poise. Fights feel extremely skill-based, and bosses that feel impossible at first try can be a breeze once you figure out how to defeat them. The combat is very focused on human enemies, however, and while the game attempts to deviate from them with certain beast-like enemies, I felt that they didn't quite fit into the combat system. Overall, everything about Sekiro is absolutely stunning; its setting, its music, its atmosphere, and its combat. The story may be somewhat cryptic but there's a sense of sheer awe that's difficult to describe that holds true throughout the entire game. It's personally one of my top games of all time, and I think everybody who has the ability to experience it has to do it in their lifetime.",10,2022-03-04,PC,user

GizMoIgor,"Sekiro: Shadows Die twice is a great game. The game is almost perfect, and although it may have a few flaws I enjoyed my full 43 hours of experience in this game. First of all the story and the theme of the Sengoku era is absolutely amazing. Although this may not be souls-like game in 100%, this game is definitely a challenge, and if you are a Dark Souls player, you will need to completely change your instincts and attidute towards some enemies. The game is based on parring and blocking instead of dodging, and in my opinion it's a great change. The game may seem like it has very little mechanics and options in it at the start. But there are a lot of skills, techniques and gadgets which make it so that you can experiment in a lot of ways. As I mentioned before the game is not so easy, but it's also not notoriously difficult. The play time is well balanced, so that it is not too short nor too long with average time to beat the game about 30 hours. If you are a player that likes challenges as well as swordsman fights with the dodge mechanic excluded, making it a whole new experience then this is the game for you.",9,2022-02-11,PC,user
namelessrequiem,"8/10, it is a very fun but the over reliance on deflecting turns me off a bit",8,2022-02-08,PC,user
hhac,"My first written review **** so this will be horrible The gameplay was really fun, I love high octane, fast-paced gameplay and this certainly did deliver. Although I only figured out the combat system, on the 25% mark and after that, everything was smooth sailing, I barely struggled on bosses or mini-bosses. the only thing I was really bad at was beast bosses/mini-bosses, especially the demon of hatred. That boss was the hardest thing I have ever done in a video game, though that might change. I didn't struggle with the final boss that much like everyone else did, I was at 19 vitality, and I believe 13 attack power. I'm confident in saying that I am GOOD at deflecting. Part is thanks to the Genichiro fight, I struggled with it probably the most at first just cause it was so early in the game and after I became more aggressive with my deflects and didn't step dodge everything like in the other soul's games I pretty much immediately won the fight. And also, the gameplay is different from soulsborne games, different enough to not be a soulsborne game but a souls-like, it has different mechanics like prosthetics and ninjutsu, special moves, and other stuff and I really liked every one of the mechanic Really solid gameplay this game has to offer. Top-notch The story, ah yes the story. This will contain spoilers so beware if you at all care about them. I enjoyed the story, the story wasn't deep and ""edgy"" as dark souls story, and you didn't have to search that deep to get the gist of it but none the less it was really enjoyable. I love storytelling where you have to find it yourself, on your own time. But the surface-level story was also really good. I really love how midgame and endgame the main area Ashina outskirts and Ashina castle get changed from a city to a brunt down battlefield There is a total of 4 endings, on my first playthrough, I chose the immortal severance ending, the ending where you break the iron code, kill your father and sever the ties of immorality by killing Kuro, which was really moving and sad, cause im a big dunce and didn't catch on that I will have to kill Kuro, if I knew, I still would've followed the ending cause I thought it was the right thing to do. Before I completed the game I thought there would be two endings, maybe one secret one but I was too committed to the ending I aimed for. I have played this game only once, and I don't know what happens in the other ending but I heard that the return ending is the ""good"" ending or more accurately the best ending. I have a dilemma with fighting/killing human opponents. For example, I really didn't want to kill the owl, I was hoping there was a mercy option but after I had to kill him he said something along the lines of, ""well-done son/wolf"" and that was very moving to me, same goes for Lady butterfly, I didn't know she was wolfs mentor while fighting her but when she said ""you've grown wolf"" in the last moments of her life I felt like **** A really solid story. What else, oh yeah the visuals. I don't have a good pc, but since sekiro and every fromsoftware game is well optimized ""despite having so many areas rendered"". I could run it on medium-high settings, and despite not playing on max setting, the game looks **** incredible, probably because I have never played a 2019 triple a game. I was watching a gameplay video of sekiro and they played on I believe max settings it looked incredible, like so good, especially the lighting. And now, my final point the difficulty, the main marketing of souls-like games. And sekiro is hard, really hard just like any other soul like, but most of it is fair difficulty and also fun challenges. There is one mini-boss that I absolutely despise and cannot refight him ever and that's headless, I don't think the fight is fun it's cheap mechanics and overall the terror abnormality is a pain in the ass, just like the other variants of it in the souls borne franchise. Almost every single move your opponent makes is perfectly telegraphed and you know what to do, but sometimes if you panic you button mash and get gravely injured. I don't really know how to end this review but I have to say, this game is good, really good. Not my favorite but up there in my top 10. id give it an 85/100.",9,2022-02-05,PC,user

Can be pretty difficult at times as expected from a fromsoftware's game, but most bosses have a weakness you can use to make you gameplay easier even with average mechanics, for example fire crackers can make the warrior on a horse boss pretty easy, and the game gives a hint about it as well. Some people say that they would not recommend it to someone new to soulsborn games, but think it might be the perfect first game.

Dodging is almost useless and the only option to defend seems to be parrying... I mean the game is already difficult, why would you limit the combat mechanics to make it even more difficult? I wish the game had some customizing options for armor, swords and etc. Therefore, in my opinion, although Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice absolutely deserved the GOTY award, but I think it could be way better than this, if some features were added.

NfeKteD,"In Sekiro, if you go with your head thinking that you are playing DarkSouls or BloodBorne, you will be very angry. Unlike the company's games, this one is not based on dodging attacks, but defending and reflecting the blows. However, the essence still remains the same, be patient until you find a loophole for 1 or 2 attacks every 30 seconds to a few minutes. The most different thing is not choosing your stats, like strength and etc because everything is done automatically, so if you don't want to keep thinking about these build things it's great. The setting, and bosses, are extremely striking too. Only complaint is the huge delay to get experience at the end of the game, if you want to get all skills you will probably find yourself farming experience in the same place for hours and hours. The game at first seems much more difficult than it seems, however, when you understand how the game works (towards the end, or in an NG+) it ends up becoming a ""walk in the park with grandma"" once you understand all mechanics.",9,2021-11-22,PC,user

jarvitom,"Its hard but this game needs to be conquered and mastered. I could do all the achievements and felt a great joy, the best feeling is when you kill that hard end boss with just your last life and feel that euphoric feeling. - level design and world is 10/10 - the storyline could have been a bit more deeper - bit annoying that you have to fight bosses multiple times, could have just come up with like 3 new ones - gameplay, combat, being a ninja simulator is fantastic - some prosthetics are never used, some goes for combat arts, could have been better if they are balanced a bit more - opened a completely new sub-genre within soulslike games",9,2021-11-15,PC,user

SilverOrlov,"I love and hate this game at the same time)) Nice and interesting story. Deep atmosphere. The concept with immortality, the consequences of resurrection, different types of immortality - generally delighted. I've seen stories like this in the books, but I haven't played one myself. The combat system makes you suffer wildly at the beginning. To sweat in the middle, even on simple enemies. And to fight like a real warrior with a katana in the end... but with bosses and mini-bosses, it's a little more difficult. They are all interesting and varied, but after Nioh, there is a deeper variety missing, not just different two samurai with different move-sets for example. Therefore, I was happy to fight the dead and monsters in this game. This is a very unconventional game in terms of gameplay. We can say that this is some kind of experiment, or ""test of the pen"" in new mechanics. The fighting in this game is a real test of reaction and attentiveness. You can pick the enemy for a long time and persistently. Most likely he will kill you, but it can be that you can win too. However, the main feature of battles here allows you to parry attacks, knocking down concentration and killing him by inflicting only one hit in health - a fatal hit(or two on bosses). ... And now what annoyed me or pissed me off: 1) Oscars for the most bugged bosses of all time(After so much time, many bosses can be beaten to death by corny revealing weaknesses of... developers and testers, and not the bosses themselves). Some of them were repaired, but the most - still can be used. 2) I do not know if this is a bug or such an idea, but a couple of times I have come across a wildly illogical thing, like, for example, a Shichimen in a palace hits with his beam through a mountain!!! to the other side of the water stream. 3) Periodically, the fixing on the enemy/target flies cancel. It's not f***g cool when, in the middle of a fight, you simply lose a fixed target and instead of going around him in a big arc, you suddenly start running towards his strong attack. 4) Very often the enemy ignores the **** when starting his attack. And no, it's not an enemy with resist to ****, because they work more often on that enemy, but this often happened. 5) A mini-boss ninja the sewers(where game started) - It's just disgusting spitting at the players to make a dexterous and fast mini-boss in an extremely meager room with almost opaque walls, which many players complained about in the Internet. 6) In a game with enemies as fast as diarrhea - the player swings with his attacks extremely slowly. In my subjective opinion, this done on purpose, because why the hell does a character run at the enemy to strike with a sword, and instead, pompously and slowly turns around himself, swings and only then strikes with a katana?! 7) ALWAYS! gets up after ""stealth action"". ALWAYS! And this is very dumb... every time you have to squat again. Constantly hit on the sit button if there are more then 2-3 enemies near you. 8) The game is full of rifles and arrows, but the player has no f***g one of them. I understand that the cornerstone of the game is swordsmanship and parrying, but it looks corny stupid. The character is a ninja, and they have always used everything that can be used to kill. Ok, let's not touch the noisy rifles, but the bows! ...No! ... just almost useless shurikens. 9) About useless things: among the consumables, there are also a lot of useless ones. For example, I used ceramic pieces only twice in the game, because they either fly somewhere to the side, or even close to the enemy do not give any reaction... I will call candies useless not because of their effects, but because for a short time, having only three pieces for a boss fight is not having them at all. 10) There is not enough variety in weapons, items, some talismans, and so on. Some of the skills and prostheses are almost useless in comparison with others, which makes the game even more ""narrow"" in this regard. 11) I liked the graphics in general, but I understand the criticism from people that it looks a little outdated for the year the game was released. 12) Curved hit-boxes. This does not happen often, but periodically and always makes the character a strong trip because this game is hard - the enemy can strike into the void next to you and you will receive damage.

You have to be aware that this is a niche game, in the same way that simulators are designed to be realistic, this game is specifically designed to be difficult.

If you really want to play the game you can just use an easy mod, it would be a weird experience because the game was not designed to be like that, but you can still enjoy the game and the rich lore, and who knows, maybe after that you can play the game for real.",10,2021-08-14,PC,user

OberiousLocke,"TLDR - Bloodborne, but they took out everything that made Bloodborne work, and set it in Japan, and also modelled it around the most finicky combat tactics from the Soulsborne series (namely parrying, which for some bizarre reason the fanboys try to argue is not actually a core, essential part of the gameplay loop despite being exactly that) FromSoft has continued their degeneration from tough-but-fair (Demon's Souls, mostly. Dark Souls 1, 95%) to Tough-and-****-the-player. The game plays nicely when it works, but unless you're a major masochist with hyperactive reflexes, I can't recommend it. Full text - Sekiro just doesn't do enough right to reach that same point of enjoyment. Your health is too low to start with, to the point where the first non-tutorial boss (Chained Ogre) can very easily knock off 50-75% of your health, roughly, meaning that if you take a single hit from your average enemy prior, he will kill you in one hit. Even if you live, you have a high chance of being flung off the map, which gets rid of the last of your health, making your respawn token's worthless. This is exacerbated when you reach Shinobi Hunter Eshin of Misen, who can take you from full health to dead faster than you can blink, you are given the opprotunity to pick up the Mikiri Counter combat skill, however it is damn near impossible to get it to work in the moment. This is both made worse by the fact that any attacks that result in a synced animation (grab attacks for instance) have some serious phantom range, to the point where you can dodge directly behind the Chained Ogre's lunging grab attack, and still get grabbed as the ogre yeets himself 180 degrees and grabs you anyway, the same thing can happen with Enshin. In no particular order I personally experienced multiple instances of being knocked out of the air by attacks that very clearly did not hit me and being grabbed out of the air by attacks that very clearly did not connect. I could go on about other things, about how the game can't tell if it's trying to be a fast paced action game or a stealth game, how the combat just doesn't match the game and it's difficulty in conjunction with your pitiful amounts of help, the game itself being generally misleading out or outright deceitful, like how it makes it clear early one that dodging is key, yet with most even basic enemies in the game, dodging is no guarentee that the enemy won't just spin in place like a top and hit you anyway. I could go on about how fighting more than one enemy at a time, which will happen very early on in the Hirata estate becausethe fact that enemies can see for miles is an absolute train wreck, or about how everything happens so quickly in a game that demands caution and precision making the game a miserable experience for those without the reflexes of a coked-up squirrel. In short, like Dark Souls 3, it suffers from Bloodborne syndrome, albeit to an outrageously higher degree. Fast paced combat that has no place in the game, lacking all the systems that made it work such as the Rally system. There IS an upgrade in the first technique scroll that allows to recover health on a deathblow, but that isn't going to help you because you generally don't get that many deathblows when it would be the most useful (i.e boss fights), and knowing the pitiful amount of health you get at the start, it probably would be uselss anyway. Hopefully by the time Elden Ring comes around, Miyazaki and co. will finally be over the hyper actively difficult game play that plagued Sekiro and Dark Souls 3 to a drastically lesser extent, and realize that it's just not fun having your skull caved in by relentless, artificial difficulty of homing attacks, low health at the start, and dying in 2-3 hits, and parry centered combat despite the fanboys screeching otherwise. If you're a horrendous Sadomasochist, I can see you getting mileage out of this. Otherwise, I really cannot bring myself to recommend this like I would FromSoft's previous work.",1,2021-08-09,PC,user

Smallchungus167,"Sekiro adds the posture system and making the constant attacking and pinpoint deflecting a must in every encounter - steel clashes on steel in a rhythmic, mesmerizing, and almost hypnotic manner. Another crucial element that makes this game such an enthralling experience to play is the inclusion of perilous attacks. When the enemy flashes a red kanji symbol, you have a second to determine what they're doing and how you're supposed to react accordingly: will they thrust you? Step on their weapon the moment it launches. Will they perform a sweep? Jump over the sweep and counter them with an overhead attack. Will they attempt to grab you? Dodge towards their back to give yourself a big opening. This system feels daunting at first, but I guarantee it will click with you at some point in the game, and it will feel fantastic to counter perilous attacks, something no other video game has ever done yet.",10,2021-08-07,PC,user

Skouyter21,"This is one of the best games I've played in a while. Yes it's difficult to play but the feeling of reward I got from beating bosses who I've been battling for hours(sometimes days) is so satisfying. You have to literally go into this game with the mindset of a professional boxer. There is going to be a lot of rounds to fight(expect to die a LOT)and you'll need to get good at studying your opponents, looking for weaknesses, and exploiting those weaknesses in a careful and timely manner. This game is chess not checkers. You also have to be a glutton for punishment in playing this as well. This isn't one of those games that will ask you if you want to decrease the difficulty because you keep getting manhandled by a boss or mini boss. You died? Too bad. Go back and try again. This game is THAT much of a savage. Those who gave this a 1 star review either thought it would be like something else entirely or just aren't built to tackle a truly challenging game experience. They want their hands held like childern and be able to beat a game easily.

Knindish46,Amazing game one of my favorites. Combat it beautiful and simple yet never gets tired. Prosthetics are an amazing tool and it seems like every enemy and boss has a specific counter. There are multiple skill trees and each ability you get changes your character a significant amount. Each skill changes the way you play or approach a fight. The environments in the world are amazing and really immerse you in the fantasy world. The enemy variety is very diverse and there are tons of unique enemies and the same applies to bosses. The game is very hard and there is no way to change it. But you can cheese a number of bosses if you want the game to be a little easier and I chose to do that with a couple.,10,2021-08-05,PC,user

Second time I actually played the game after having some experience, it's challenging: until you get the hang of the bosses moves and counter often. 3rd play through is easy: you'll have mastered countering and see how repetitive the bosses are. 4th play through was a spreed run for me. 5th run I got bored of being OP. Doesn't play like dark souls but is definitely worth buying on sale: I'd say it's just as hard as DS for first time players.",10,2021-08-05,PC,user
Makejames188,"This game has Tenchu lineage in it's blood and that's a good thing. The combat, while a very challenging and fluid affair is not the only means to take out the enemies presented to you in this huge yet dense action adventure/stealth game. THIS IS NOT DARK SOULS. Just because you have played that series or Bloodborne doesn't not mean the same mechanics and principles apply. This is a stealth action game where running away and finding ambush and vantage point to whittle down the enemies numbers rewards you more than swinging your sword till things die. This game rewards patience alot more than brazen fighting ability. As a lover of the stealth genre it's painful tio watch players stand on the top of a building with a huge vantage point that allows you to scope out the area and plan you attack just jump into the middle of four to five enemies yelling that the game is too hard. There's more than one way to play this game. I'd definitely recommend it to stealth action players and fans , not to casual Souls fans.",10,2021-08-05,PC,user

Solid gameplay, fluid mechanics and fairness. That's right, above anything else Sekiro is fair. Above all else what makes Sekiro so great is the gradual improvement you make. You keep grinding, keep getting hit, keep losing and dying until you figure out all the patterns, all moves and you can see how much better you become. The first playthrough I died well over 1000 times. Second plythrough I died maybe 500 times.

Jahuui6148,"Having played all dark souls games as well as Bloodborne I thought I was well prepared for Sekiro. I soon realized i was not. A lot of the mechanics seem similar yet so different. The combat system is stunning. As I never used shields in any souls game, always just grabbing the biggest weapon I could get my hands on I had a hard time getting used to deflecting. Majority of combat is deflecting attacks and boy it is satisfying to get a streak of perfect deflects. Most boss fights are so incredible that I did not mind at all getting my ass smacked over and over. Especially Owl (father), I died to him at least a dozen times yet I enjoyed every single fight. Most bosses have unique movesets and are very challenging yet beatable. Story is very engaging and despite wanting to go for the Shura ending I chose the Purification mostly because of the want to be the ""good guy"". Character dialogues hide a lot of secrets and similarly as in other FromSoft games most of the story is hidden. Most characters, including mini-bosses, have an interesting backstory worth exploring through eavesdrops, item collection and easter eggs. Death is arguably more punishing than in souls. Upon death Sekiro loses half his Sen (money) and a lot of experience. Neither is anyhow possible to regain other than gaining new. The skill system is very intricate however I found only a select few of the skills to be useful. On the other hand the prosthetic tool upgrades were one of my favourite features, however difficult it is to fully upgrade all of the **** best part about Sekiro are the bosses. Never being a fan of big bosses I was very sceptical of the Guardian Ape. I was pleasantly surprised how well done the boss is and I enjoyed it as much as all the swordfights, which are absolutely spectacular. The only bossfights I did not like were the Divine Dragon and The Folding Monkeys. Other that those two, all bosses are a masterpiece.",10,2021-06-30,PC,user

But Sekrio is so much harder than any Souls game i've played i was genuinely surprised. This game is so hard, it will bring out a fiery rage in even the calmest gamer amongst us.

Jamie2683,"After doing the game 100% and unlocking every single achievement, i feel like i can finally make a review of it. I will list my pros and cons and then make a small comentary about it: Pros: + Game is very polished, and i did not feel like i was getting BS killed as it happened sometimes with the Dark Souls games. + Combat is more dynamic than any of the Dark Souls, and also more than bloodborne. + It has a story you can follow without reading 400 item descriptions. + ""Bonfires"" at bosses door makes it far more entertaining, as it allows you to fight them full HP and items, so you can play more agro, and it's also a LOT less infuriating when you die. + Graphics are really beautiful. I wish i had a monitor over 1080p to play this. + Defeating some bosses for the first time feels like a real achievement, not crappy ""ez mechanics"" like Storm Ruler on DS3. + Customizable controls! +Had way less "" it im leaving it here"" with this game than with any other fromsoftware title. Cons: - Once you get the parry system, it's more of a walk than anything else to be honest.Combining NG+ and NG++ i only died to bosses 3 times, doing the two longest endings, and one of them was because i ran out of battery on my controller. - It only took me 42 hours to unlock every single achievement and complete 4 runs (from ng to ng+++). - Although you have a lot of prosthetic tools and upgrades, and habilities at your disposal, if you learn to parry almost every single one of them is rendered useless.",10,2021-06-30,PC,user

The soundtracks were cool. 30 Hours of gameplay well-spent for me.",10,2021-06-29,PC,user

Zenitsu44,One word : Masterpiece .For me this game is one of the best From Software Games. Even as a seasoned Dark Souls Veteran i had some trouble with bosses but once u learn the combat of this game it feels satisfying to play. When i went into this game i had the mindset that it was a similar game to Dark Souls. But the Combat is completely different. The Focus is not on dodging but rather on parry. I will continue to play this game for some time and i can recommend this game to anyone who seeks a challenge.,10,2021-06-27,PC,user

5Naelok,"Playing Sekiro is this bizarre dance between feeling utterly helpless and completely invulnerable. You first encounter a boss and the mops the floor with you. You struggle to stay ahead of his attacks, guzzling potions and cursing as you barely manage to shave off even 25% of a health bar in there before dying. You get smashed down and murdered by the **** again and again. Then it clicks, and you've got it. You know to jump right after the fury attack, back up and then counter when he raises his blade over his left shoulder and that he's wide open if you get behind him after the sword combo. All of a sudden you're blowing through the boss' first form (or maybe two) without taking a hit. I like that feeling. It's damn hard, but I'm not getting better at fights because I leveled up my sword power, I am getting better because I have mastered these immensely complicated patterns and am weaving between them to attain victory. For it is in that gap between helplessness and invulnerability where true beauty is to be found.",10,2021-06-27,PC,user
