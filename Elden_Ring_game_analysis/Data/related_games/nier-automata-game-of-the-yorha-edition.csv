Adreil044,Now I am thinking about how foolish I was when I was about to decide whether to drop the game or complete other endings. The game become surprisingly deep and significantly better after the first playthrough. The only thing I regret is choosing ending C over ending E; I can confirm that it was so much better. Anyway the game deserve a 10/10 for sure.,10,2025-03-13,PLAYSTATION 4,user

RandomBolt,"This game is a remarkable experience from start to some 2/3 of the game. Music, animation, storyline, combat, it goes on and on. *Spoilers about game lenght* Even what people would expect to be worse part of the game execution I enjoyed a lot, even more than the first part of the game. I won't delve too much into it because spoilers. What I felt is towards the later part of the game, it fell apart somewhat, preventing this from being a resounding 10. Yoko Taro seems to mention a time crunch in interviews and I think it shows. At this point one is probably 25-30h into the game. I feel it would have been better to not stick to wanting a 35h+ game, as there would have been times the game could have ended well and passed on to a sequel. So there was some amount of ""one more thing"" and with lack of time the execution suffered. I hope this particular stage of the game is remade some time later, so we can enjoy what the creator intended for this remarkable game. As someone wisely said on a review, I wish I could forget this just to play it again.",9,2025-01-23,PLAYSTATION 4,user

whynothacked,"NiER: Automata стала моей любимой игрой Давно слышал об этом тайтле, но решил попробовать только сейчас и ни капли не пожалел - Великолепный сюжет - Красивая графика - Прекрасные анимации - Отличная оптимизация - Подробный лор с динамическим развитием событий - Огромное, даже ОГРОМНОЕ количество механик и возможностей Игра наполнена прекрасным сюжетом, динамическими боями, системой прокачки и великолепной историей 2B и 9S, которая, признаюсь, вывела на слезы. Никогда не думал что можно настолько тесно совместить бои и заботу друг о друге, желание быть рядом и защищать друг друга, при этом выполняя долг воинаОднозначно рекомендую это произведение искусства",10,2025-01-03,PLAYSTATION 4,user

A caverna que o Emil mora, foi uma das explorações mais únicas que eu já fiz em toda a minha vida. A vibe daquele lugar, com aquela música, puta que pariu. A história é muito boa.

spott904,"NieR:Automata is a game I absolutely love. The story is captivating, and the music is beautiful, adding a lot to the overall experience.

palaceguard,"If i could give decimal point scores NieR:Automata would be a 9.5 so i am just going to round it to 10 . The reason its not a 10 is cause of the gameplay, its really bland but NieR isn't meant to wow you with stellar gameplay thats just how Yoko Taro makes his games which you can see in drakengard and the original nier. Although its fun and flashy and extremely satisfying to dodge,everybody whos played knows that its repetitive and the weapons do the same animations depending on the type. Other than that little inconvenience which is easily looked over everything else is a high 9 and 10. The story is phenomenal,an easy 10, the amount of detail and quality writing in this game is something to really appreciate. The music is heavenly, NieR has easily the top 3 best soundtracks oat. The characters are great and their development is done really well. The open world is decent but not really big, but it is really interesting. Graphics aren't the greatest but this game was made in 2017 for the last generation of consoles and PCs, they're good enough but if they remaster this game with modern final fantasy level graphics it would easily be goty nominee. The amount of subtle differences in every new playthrough that really emphasise the references to philosophy is done perfectly. The ending is one the greatest endings ive ever witnessed. And the amount of nostalgia from the previous NieR in this one is just really nice. Overall this game is a must play,most will never even touch this game because of how different it is to the typical AAA title but thats what makes this game a masterpiece.",10,2024-08-01,PLAYSTATION 4,user
FrancisWoodly,"Yoko Taro delivered an creative masterpiece here, no doubt about it.2B and 9S are also great charackters and iconic videogame charackters for sure. But the graphic and gameplay alone is for 2024 not really great tbh. You also have to be in the right mood to play this game because of its really depressing and melancholic theme.",8,2024-07-03,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Kiarika121,I love the characters and the world building. The story is fantastic and emotional too and has a deeper meaning behind it. Combat system is fun. The only problem I have is the fact I have to play it 3 times fo get the real ending of the game and 2 times the exact same thingfrom the sight of 2B and then of 9S. There are some tiny differences like the hacking thing but it's the same story and kinda is annoying to have to go through it again. It gets a bot better by the fact that this story is playable in around 12 hours. But I would have liked a longer main story in one playthrough instead!,9,2024-06-06,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Viktorr_Odinson,"Jogo espetacular, um dos melhores RPG que eu já joguei, o universo de Nier é complexo e vasto, os personagens possuem profundas camadas que aos poucos a história nos mostra. A Gameplay também é muito fluída, ótimo combate, as Boss Fights são emocionantes. O jogo visualmente também é muito belo e impressiona pela fantástica direção artística. É um jogo quase perfeito se não fosse por alguns problemas. Nier Automata se vende como um jogo Mundo Aberto mas é extremamente linear e com pouquíssimas opções de exploração ou de missões secundárias. O jogo no PS4 tem alguns problemas de desempenho também, principalmente com quedas bruscas de Frame Rate e travamentos. O que me causou um pouco de desconforto e me impediu de ter uma experiência perfeita. Por isso não vou dar nota máxima, mas as qualidades do jogo se destacam muito mais que os defeitos, ainda é um grande jogo e recomendo demais, excelente RPG com uma história muito envolvente e personagens carismáticos. Um adendo: A trilha sonora é muito boa e tem no Spotify. Recomendo ouvir o álbum inteiro.",9,2024-05-15,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Sr_Bue_Bue,"Hacía mucho tiempo que no jugaba a un juego japonés, lo mismo con un RPJ. Decidí jugar por su diseño artístico, que me llamaba mucho la atención, y por su jugabilidad, que me recordaba mucho a otro juego que me gusta mucho, Bayonetta. Al principio estaba muy perdido, ya que muchas cosas me resultaban raras o crípticas, sobretodo la forma de mejorar al personaje protagonista. Pero no dejé de jugar, algo hacía que quisiera continuar. La música, la historia, lo dinámica que es la jugabilidad, el universo del juego, todo me encantaba. Sí que es verdad que cuando me pasé el juego por primera vez, y vi lo que hay a continuación, al principio se me hizo cuesta arriba, pero conforme pasan las horas, ves que cada vez vale más la pena continuar, especialmente cuando comienzas la tercera partida. Ahí fue donde el juego me atrapó por completo. No es un juego perfecto, no tiene los mejores gráficos, muchas misiones secundarias no importan mucho, te hacen caminar de un lado a otro más de la cuenta... pero aun con todo eso, me lo pasé muy bien. Tiene momentos e historias que me parecieron brillantes. Únicas. No esperaba que me fuera a gustar tanto. Me declaro fan de Yoko Taro.",9,2024-02-06,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Gallium,"Truly a great game. There are one or two parts of this game that when I think about them, my heart THROBS in pain. This is how much this game naisl being emotional with success. This could have been a 10/10 but I remove 1 point for the robot protag to be dressed as a robot maid. Why? This is truly unfait to the character,a thirst trap that removes from the rest of the game. I also remove another 1 point for having to chain the game content so many time. It's genius in most part, except when you just need to redo entire parts of the game you already did with no change at all. This parts were boring. Story is good. Characters, revelations, plot reveals, these are great. Then you finish the game, and it propose to you an interesting New Game+. With some original content. This is nice. Then you finish again, and this time you have another New Game+ with only original content that is incredibly painful in an emotional way. God this game made cry.

Big_S_Online,"This is one of the greatest - if not the best - games ever created. The story is intriguing and immersive; the combat is incredibly smooth and challenging to an accurate level of the difficulties; the characters and world is terrifically developed and I have replayed it many times (which is a must), but also come back to it at numerous occasions.

Haannss,"The story is very original, interesting and captivating, and the various endings make it even better. The graphics are ok without surprising, while the OST does surprise due to its excellence. The gameplay offers alternatives, it might not be the most memorable but at least the characters add various strategies. The great downside comes with the game not autosaving, nor offering the possibility to save in a whole mission. Add that to the possibility of crash (happened 3 times and had to restart, playing in 2023) and you have the killer combo to waste your time. And it wasn't necessary for this game. A true pity. It really needs to be fixed.",5,2023-11-06,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Nyeoni,"Nier: Automata has sort of a messy narrative style, comparable to that of Quentin Tarantino. On my first play through, I felt like I had a vague understanding of the plot but nothing more. It isn’t until you play through the final route of the game that the tangled web of plot points start to connect in quite a profound way and you realize the message was right under your nose the whole time. This game draws influence from real-life existential philosophy, and this might fly under the radar if most of the characters weren’t directly named after the famous philosophers who proposed those questions. It is the type of game that relies on the immersive and interactive nature of its medium to properly convey its message. In other words, if Nier: Automata were a film, book, or tv show instead ****, the story’s impact would be lost. I encourage everyone to play this game and go in completely blind like I did.",10,2023-10-02,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Alex_Pilgrim008,"Nier Automata was one of 2017's best action games. Developed by Platinum (Bayonetta, Vanquish), it's a blend of hack 'n slash and bullet hell gameplay. Featuring an involving story, a desolate world and evocative music, it's comparable to Shadow of the Colossus. You play as 2B, an android warrior tasked with neutralizing rebellious machines. If there was ever a Final Fantasy game directed by Hideo Kojima, then it be like this. The Game of the Yorha Edition includes extra skins, avatars, a theme and DLC. ""Automata"" has plenty of action, but isn't perfect. It has stuttering issues, only a few tutorials and unhelpful map. To finish the story, you need beat the game three times!. Overall, this is a terrific game. I would rate it with a 9 out of 10.",9,2023-07-27,PLAYSTATION 4,user

martinho_99,"+ astonishing 3D level design and camera angles + nice voice actors in original japanese audio + feels like playing an anime, especially combat + cool retro style arcade shooting parts + interesting mixture of different genres and fighting systems (3D vs 2D) + impressivly deep story with lots of philosophic backround + no bugs or graphic errors + amazing very long fighting sequences + outstandingly creative ideas and gimmicks (like in menu, settings, the joke endings, Ending E) + great art style and animations in most moments - sexist design of 2B and A2 in contrast to their well written strong female characters - combat often reduces to dodging and button smashing, learning the moveset of enemies is mostly not necessary as well as choosing a particular move of your character, the moveset of enemies is too repetative and easy to foresee - the music is nice but too intense after a while - sometimes lazy or bad animations like water surface or climbing stairs - route B is a bit too much like a boss rush of the same bosses you fought just a few hours before (when not doing sidequests) Overall a very unique gaming experience with lots of love for little details.

The art design is pretty good, but the technical part is pretty badly executed. This is due to the small development budget. If you are ready to put up with and turn a blind eye to certain roughness of technical performance, then this video game will definitely give you emotions and make you think about some things.

TediPik,"The music was literally the only reason I finished the game, as the story in route C (which was supposed to be ""godlike"") turned out to ****. The philosophy was supposed to be ""out of this world"", in truth the philosophical motives discussed during the game were high-school level, aside from the fact that they were investigated into at a very superficial level. Is this game mostly played by kids who are only now being introduced to the thoughts and works of Nietzsche and the like? Because it sure as hell looks like it. The game may give you a feeling of emptiness and depression after beating it, but that’s about it. I was hoping for a “transcendental journey” and “deep reflection on the condition of modern humanity”, but I didn’t get to experience anything which would even remotely resemble the ubiquitous praise and high esteem perpetuated by a number of players. Pushing yourself to finish the game if you don’t feel like playing it is a mistake. Believing players that you should force yourself to finish route B, which has some major faults in game design, only to proceed with the story, is a mistake. Don’t get me started on combat mechanics, graphics, etc., as the game falls short in this department as well. In my particular case, it’s over 20 hours down the drain.",1,2022-01-13,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Haughtman,"This game is a must play for anyone who loves a meaningful, thought provoking, and emotional story in a video game with great gameplay. Nier: Automata deconstructs existentialism and nihilism in more effective ways than even the Blade Runner films. Not only do you constantly learn more vital information to the story’s themes throughout the playthrough of endings A-E, but the emotional impact of this information only grows stronger. The more you play the happier the lighter moments are and the sadder the heavy moments are, as nothing grows stale throughout its long playtime (around 30 hours to complete endings A-E). Even the side quests add so much meaning that I’m surprised some aren’t mandatory. The design of each element of the game feels purposeful, like the upgrade chips you install into your android protagonists, the legitimacy of fast travel using new bodies, and the different types of gameplay that ranges from third person hack-and-slash to retro shoot ‘em up. On top of all this, the game's soundtrack is without a doubt the best I’ve ever heard. Even if you don’t like the gameplay for whatever reason or the heavily philosophical story doesn’t resonate with you, the soundtrack is one you’ll want to listen to on repeat. This game jumped into my top 10 favorite games of all time and I have no doubt in that decision.",10,2021-09-29,PLAYSTATION 4,user

djdizzy,"This is a fantastic game, I’ve never played anything quite like it. It’s predominantly a hack & slash but it changes into a 2.5D shooter, 2D fighter, twin-stick shooter and a couple variations of bullet hell shmup. The gameplay is tight and lots of fun for all of the genres that it becomes. That tight gameplay comes with RPG elements (upgrades) as it progresses. The music is outstanding and some of the best I’ve heard in a game. All of these elements are wrapped in an outstanding, deep story. I’ve never come across a game that incorporates these styles of gameplay with strong story-driven elements. In fact, I’ve never played a game with a story like this. While this game isn’t for everyone (nothing ever is); nobody can deny that this is a standout title. The graphics aren’t the best but they’re not bad. There is some texture pop-in at times and the world is barren. But the barren world is fitting to the plot as well as the vibe of the game. I can’t recommend this game enough. Now for the negative about the DLC (Game of the Yorha Edition): The first issue is that the DLC doesn’t come in the actual game. It comes with a download code that you must then register and download the DLC for free. The second issue is that I’m not sure how to unlock the extra outfits. However you do that in the game, I haven’t figured it out yet. So unfortunately, this edition is crap.",9,2021-04-25,PLAYSTATION 4,user

LunaresArienal,"Long story short, I might have missed what most people seem to really love in that game. The music is fantastic (the one in the desert or in the parc are demented). The atmosphere is really breathtaking. Narration is very complex and brings tons of different angles as the story unfolds. Combats are really dynamic and generally fun. The gameplay changes several times during the game and really add to the fun. There also are some great easter eggs I loved finding. And, that's it to me. The game suffers a lot of really serious issues to me that kind of ruin the fun and don't really compel me to come back to it. Some of them would be * Really boring, fedex side quests. Most of the side quests are just ""go fetch that on the other side of the map and come back to me"". Although they have a strong narrative content as well, the actual quest is just roaming through the map, again and again and again. * That map. Let's talk about it. It's huge and really impractical. There are tons of roadblocks, complicated paths to take. I can't even guess how many hours I spent just trying to run from point A to point B on that map. * The UI is generally bad. Although there are some brilliant features to the UI when you - as a machine - are in a dire state, when you are playing normally, the mini-map is absolutely unreadable. The points of interest and quests are very hard to find. You can't turn on and off the quest locations. The games feels very old in that way. * Combat. I know I said it was fun and dynamic. But at the end of the day, I've done most of the game using the same weapon, pod, build and special. I would have loved to have the game incentivize the variety of playstyles, with foes resisting a type of weapon or ... i don't know, prizes ? Finally I would have to say that the story itself it kind of unsettling. I know that's part of what Square Enix did. And they did it fantastically well, which is a strong suit of the game.

It's difficult to explain exactly what I mean by that sentence without ruining the experience, so if you have the chance to try the game out, I strongly suggest you do so. If you go in with an open mind, you may come away from Nier: Automata with a new and interesting perspective on things.

Zeph93,"This is a sprawling open world game, packed with places to explore and secrets of the past to unravel. The story is stark, and compelling enough (though not as 'deep' as some reviews here would lead you believe) to make you want to see the game to its conclusion. The score is also fantastic for the most part, which helps draw your attention from the bleak settings. However, therein lies the main problem. To get to the 'true' ending, you have to play this game 3 times from different character perspectives. What's different between these characters? Not a whole lot, to be honest. This would be more forgiving if the areas you have to trawl through repeatedly aren't so bland and devoid of life - literally. In this apocalyptic setting, you fight robot organisms with very little in the way of variety. Bosses are standout moments from a design point, but typically devolve into an odd combination of bullet hell, and bullet sponge. If you are a completionist, expect to spend a lot of time farming the same roomful of enemies ad infinitum for the hopes rare materials will drop for upgrades. This game would have benefited greatly from more unique story paths, or greater variation in play styles of the characters. Instead, expect to feel burn out around the halfway mark from the sheer repetition and the question; while the future may be bleak, must it be so boring?",6,2020-07-30,PLAYSTATION 4,user

SplitMind,"Let's get the first thing out of the way - it is a complete con to sell a new version **** with the additional content on a voucher and not the disc, especially when this additional content is paltry at best. This game is unique and will forever be etched into my mind, however I think there were a few missteps where they tried too hard. The combat is generally good, however when multiple enemies are on the screen at once it gets very chaotic and I found it hard to dodge due to there being so much going on. It makes for a wonderful visual display but isn't always practical. The story is a highlight of the game which needs to be played to be properly enjoyed. There's nothing as memorable as robots having existential crises and identity issues. However the whole multiple endings concept wasn't very well executed and became tedious towards the (fifth?) ending. They tried to be a bit too meta here. On your first playthrough there is enough mystery to pique curiosity but after another few attempt it gets a bit muddled. I'd say I found the ending fairly unsatisfying really. The soundtrack is very memorable and haunting; definitely a highlight that I'd want to download to listen again later. The graphics are also something to behold simply due to the framerate. I've not seen many games on the PS4 achieve such a high framerate that is consistent. It causes my PS4Pro to sound like a jet engine at times but this didn't concern me. Overall, this game is well worth it. I actually didn't enjoy this when I first played it but reading up on it showed me just how much I missed out on. One further criticism I'd have is that I had to read up on a bit too much for this game, from story analysis to consequences of choices offered in game. I found this more annoying than interesting. Still well worth the price tag these days.",8,2020-06-10,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Nielivarez,"* TLDR and my suggestion: Nier Automata is a decent game that left me with mixed feelings. It's unique. But it also has its frustrating moments. If you are out of good games then give this one a go. I suggest you don't touch the side-quests and just progress the main story. You'll have a way better time. * I originally had written a much longer review of this game but to MetaCritic's 5K letter limit I had to cut in half and forgo the positives. There are many of those reviews out there. * What keeps this game from being a masterpiece? As great as Nier Automata is, it has it's annoying moments. And unless these moments are addressed with fair and constructive critisicm, they will be included Yoko Taro's next games or any aspiring developer who wants to learn from this game. That's the main reason I am writing thise piece, and that's why I am surprised as to how many reviews, even those who sporadically mention these flaws, ingnore them in their ratings. - Flawed pacing: The pacing of Nier Automata reminded me of MGS5. When a quest becomes available, I, the cosumer, take it as a sign that the game wants me to do it. However these side-quests have almost nothing to do with your main quest and doing them actually hurts the pacing of the game. So basically, no story development while you are doing unrelated side-missions and when a story development does happen you know that a snooze-fest is awaiting you further ahead until the next development happens. Keep in mind, these side-missions are designed to be a part of the game; if you delete them, you're omitting a big chunk of the game. - Sinful side-quests: These side-quests are not only causing pacing issues for the main mission but they themselves are to put it mildly 'unispired'. All the old sins of the 90s are here. 'Fetch quests' are the best you can hope for. 'Escorting helpless NPCs' are here as well. And the one side-mission where you 'walk aimlessly in a huge barren desert, hoping to chance upon hidden items' just takes the cake. They're the prime examples of 'filler content'. The 'existential crisis' these quest convey isn't due to the story but your IRL time-waste. - Main story momentum killers: For some reason, the cool moments in the game are immediately followed by some event that intentionally kills the flow. It's like the cow that produces a lot of milk but as the bucket starts to fill, poops a hard dung in it and spoils it all. For example, after a cool event, you are forced to stumble for about 4-5 minutes across the map unable to use any abilities. You also can't jump. This clearly intends to frustrate the player. But why? I'd calmly put down the controller and play another game. - Unnecessary multiple playthroughs: The multiple playthroughs turned out to be more of a marketing strategy. [PARAGRAPH BELOW TALKS ABOUT NUMBER OF PLAYTHROUGHS. SKIP IF YOU CONSIDER IT A SPOILER] The game has 5 meaningful endings. To get those endings you have to play '3 routes'. However the 2nd route 80% matches your 1st playthrough, and the rest are bits of new info sprinkled in. The 3rd playthrough is basically a new segment of the story locked behind those 2. Keep this in mind as we go on. [END OF DISCUSSION ABOUT NUMBER OF PLAYTHROUGHS] Here's the problem. Halfway through your first playthrough, you unlock the fast-travel. However, when you start your 2nd route this fast-travel mechanic is taken away until you unlock it again in the middle of your current playthrough. So you have to do all the boring trekking once more, doing the same missions again. I personally find it this decision very hard to swallow. So, given how much new content exists in these multiple playthroughs, you are basically dealing with a single normal-length campagn which is stretched through muliple playthoughs to artificially inflate its length and value. I don't know whether this was an executive decision by Yoko Taro or an artistic one, but what it leaves me with, is the sense that the game doesn't respect my time, at all. - Under-utilized combat: This is a Platinum game. You except to see cool fights and skill based slashing. But unfortunately the JRPG nature of the game overtakes and leaves the combat under-utilized. Combat is more about your level that it's about your skill. You slash and then you dodge. The system of combat is very simplified. If the enemy is +10 levels higher than you, the fight is gonna drag on until you give up or finish it and not gain anything for your hard effort. The lackluster nature of combat extends to your weapons too. There are many weapons in the game but the weapons of the same class all share the same movesets. A greatsword has the same animation and moveset as a halberd! This is a huge disappointing and limiting factor for a game that wants to encourage exploring and finding those weapons. Summary: Nier Automata is a good game but you will have to practice patience, especially if you are a completionist.",7,2020-06-06,PLAYSTATION 4,user
TheGoodGoat,"I have a habit of explaining to my mother the stories of games that I enjoy. This is the only game I have explained to her where she agreed that the point the game made was incredible and she did not say ""You're 32, stop playing videogames."" The one flaw of this game is that unless you get all the endings, the game will not seem that good. I know this sounds like a cop out but it is the truth. The beauty of the game is exactly that. It vets the uncurious and simple players who just want to smash robots and win and leaves the rest of the game to be enjoyed by the ones who care about the story and are intrigued by the existentialist crises that occur through the game's many characters. I forced myself to play a second time around after getting the first ending and I was not really looking forward to it but the good game play made me enjoy it quite a lot. By the end of all the five main endings, I saw what the game was doing and I had the greatest gaming moment of my life. I will not spoil it and you should not look to see what it is but it is an incredible moment that is anti-nihilistic and explains the value of life, love, perseverance and helping each other.",10,2020-05-27,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Its quirky, addictive, and has a good story with some interesting twists. My only criticism is that the second play through (there are 5 main endings, requiring 3 play throughs) is a little too similar to the first and the character is no where near as fun to control as the one you start out with. I was finding myself doing less of the side quests on that one.

LordOMO,"There is a lot of stuff to like about this game. For example the smooth movement and combat, the veritcality of the open world, a solid soundtrack, the way the camera adjusts to the situation (top down during bullet hell sequences, sidescrolling for platforming, free floating during sword combat etc.). However many people have pointed these things out already so i'm going to leave it at that and move on to the negatives. - load times feel to long - i don't find any of the main characters in this game particularly interesting or likable (however they are not obnoxious either) - after I saw the credits rolling for the first time I was a little disappointed. The ending felt unsatisying and rushed, especially since I found many themes in the story to be quite promising. It also took me only 12 hours to get to the credits. Not a great first impression. New game plus added some interesting gameplay and story content. However the story content only added more to my confusion. A lot of stuff was added but it didn't explain the ""Why"" for me. At the end of the game i feel like i still don't know anything about YorHa or the robots on earth. And the main characters and their motivations only become less tangible throughout the game - graphics. I'm playing on a base PS4 and quite frankly was shocked by how ugly the game looks. Resolution is sub 1080p with heavy aliasing and despite targeting 60fps the game drops frames heavily quite often. Also texture quality is quite low. The art style doesn't help either, making for a bleak and overall rough looking image. It's laughable when you consider that games like Horizon which are similar in scope and released around the same time just look generations ahead. If you leave this game on the menu screen for a while a trailer will start playing and I feel like the trailer is how the game should have looked: it's a much smoother and clearer image with more vibrant colours. I don't know how the PS4 Pro image compares but on base PS4 graphics are a massive disappointment. All of this being said i think that Nier Automata is an overall good game. I would recommend it to people who want a ""hard scifi"" game mixed with fluent combat and are willing to look past the games superficial ""ugliness"". Otherwise there are a bunch better looking games to play. The game, especially the story is really overhyped in my opinion so i'd also recommend drastically lowering your expectations for the story and the music",8,2019-06-29,PLAYSTATION 4,user

mistwalker14,"I was pretty excited to finally play this game after hearing all the praise it has, not only from fans, but a lot of gaming outlets as well, almost all the time I tend to agree with them, but this is just one of those times where I just don't quite get it.... This game is a combination of an Action game, with an open world and some RPG elements, also there are some shoot'em up elements (the second playable character will have a lot of sections of this) and the game can't even execute one of those single genres well.... The combat, which is similar to Bayonetta if you are familiar with that series, 2 attack buttons: 1 heavy and 1 light attack, but in this case, the combo variety options this game offers are pretty limited and considering the poor enemy ai design, their paterns are very predictable and honestly, most of them feel the same while fighting them, you'll just end up using the same moves over and over again, there's really not a real challenge, unless higher the difficulty settings which only makes the game harder in an artificial way (enemies do more damage). None of the bosses feel memorable, at least in a gameplay-wise pov. Now into the open-world and RPG aspect.... I don't really understand what was the point of making this game open-world, none of the side-quests are interesting in any way, most of them consist of the same thing (go here, kill enemy, collect item, return to quest giver) and the fact that the game purposely (""lore"") avoids a auto-save feature so you'll have to save every single time, because in most cases, the game doesn't offer check-points (although in my experience, some boss fights did have them... for some reason). It is worth mentioning that, at least for me, for an open world game to be good it most have a world where you can forget about the main missions for a bit, and this game just doesn't have that kind of world.... most of the areas are empty, and since it is using gameplay elements from an action game... you really don't have anything to do in it.... I really feel this should be a linear game separated by chapters, like every other action game in the market, at least if this game is supposed to be ""all about the story bro"" like their fans are claiming it to be. The leveling system doesn't feel as rewarding like other RPGs, because it doesn't really serve a purpose in the game... except for some side-quest that won't adjust to your level, and since you have to buy your abilities with in-game currency, I don't see why it was implemented. The graphics are really not that good for what this generations is capable of, these are on the same level as a PS3/360 game, for the looks of it, they used the same engine Platinum used for Bayo 1, MGS Rising. I do admit some areas, like the castle in the woods, do look pretty. My favorite aspect of this game is the music, I think it is one of the few things the game nails to achieve. The story is... interesting, but I'll have to admit I don't really get the praise it receives, but the fact that you have to deal with all the boring gameplay aspects made it kinda difficult for me to really enjoy the trip, and the fact that you have to beat the game 2 TIMES (the second one is way worse than the first one, since you won't be having a 2nd button attack here, but a ""hacking"" button that triggers a shoot'em up minigame... meaning that you'll have to play it hundreds of times) to get to the second part of the main story just made it worse. I particulary like the english dub, I think the voices of the 3 main characters nailed it in their roles, and I say this as someone who likes to play/watch things in their original language. I guess I'll admit that 2B's character model.... is quite something, but sex appeal won't make me higher my final score for this game lol. I do know that Yoko Taro games are known for having pretty bad gameplay and a lot of technical issues, and since this game was developed by Platinum Games, this is one of the better ones in those aspects, and I really don't have an issue if the guy has an audience that likes his games, but for gaming outlets and other professional reviewers completely ignoring this game's issues and going as far as nominating it for GOTY alongside games that actually are well crafted GAMES (Breath of the Wild, Persona 5) is something I can't respect.",6,2019-05-15,PLAYSTATION 4,user

It just felt kind of empty to me, combat was good, animation was nice, but the settings were hideously ugly and dull, most of the sets looked worse then the original game, I just couldn't click with it, never got to finish the first play through as my interest just kept trailing off, no idea how you could play it multiple times, there must be a good game here, but I've just struggled to connect with it so not a recommendation from me.",5,2019-04-08,PLAYSTATION 4,user
Lestatman,I had not played the previous games so went in without any prior bias. Was enjoying it till I got to the ending and then another ending and then another ending by which point I had gotten tired of it and wished it just had one ending and thats it.,6,2019-03-28,PLAYSTATION 4,user

hello_world,"Gameplay wise, there is nothing special about Nier: Automata. If you like Platinum games, you can enjoy the combat, though it is not as good as the Bayonetta series, it's not as bad as the Korra game. Where the game truely shines is its narrative. The game uses the works of philosophers like Nietzsche to tell the story and serve as a backbone for its core themes. While they don't provide any interesting commentary on the works they reference, very few games even attempts on tackling this subject matter and they actually do some quite clever things to its narrative and gameplay to invoke the works they reference. The game ends with the most interesting moral choice in video games ever. I won't spoil it here, but I will say that unlike other games where a moral choice usually means you see one of two endings, this is a moral choice with actual consequence on the player making the choice. One main gripe I have with the game is the character design of 2B. I'm no prude, but I was disappointed that with everything else about the narrative of the game being so well thought out and deliberate, that the only justification the creator had for 2B's sexualised design was that he likes looking at hot girls. This is a rather shallow design choice as it sacrifices both realism and characterisation. On the realism front, there is no reason to send a battle android into battle in a dress. It offers no protection and later on you see that they could have put her in amour the entire time, they just chose not to. On the characterisation front, 2B is portrayed as a cold, aloof character that is actually emotionally vulnerable and caring on the inside. Again this is not reflected in her character design as nothing about a skirt suggests cold on the outside, caring on the inside. Again a suit of amour would have fit in better as it alludes to the fact that her cold exterior is just a defence mechanism to help her not get too close to those she cares about, but if you get past her emotional amour, she is vulnerable. With everything else being so well thought out, the decision to put 2B in a skimpy outfit seems like a missed opportunity.",8,2019-03-09,PLAYSTATION 4,user

VioleGreis,"So we all already known that Nier:Automata was the nice game and has some performance issues, but Yorha edition just do nothing for original Nier, it doesn't fix bugs or improve performance, not give us new game-play features, just a few avatars ( who care about them? ) and pod skins ( the same as avatars ). So i really don't understand why you give to this game 8-9 score. That score should be on Nier:Automata but not Yorha edition.",2,2019-03-01,PLAYSTATION 4,user

Tongafa,"Este es sin lugar a dudas un videojuego ante todo muy divertido. Nunca te deja de sorprender, e inclusive hasta en los últimos compases es capaz de traer algo nuevo al tablero de juego. Gracias a ello prácticamente nunca se vuelve monótono o aburrido. Nuevas mecánicas, cambios de perspectiva, mini juegos muy entretenidos, todo sirve para divertir, además de que todo se hace muy bien. Pero no solo es algo frenético y lleno de acción como cabría esperar dicho lo dicho. Estamos ante un videojuego que también tiene una faceta muy profunda y compleja. Inclusive llegado el final del mismo, este se las arregla para seguir sorprendiéndote si uno como jugador se atreve a adentrarse más en el mundo de NieR Autómata. Hay muchísimas referencias en todas partes, desde referencias filosóficas que las hay hay montones, hasta visuales o de diseño de arte. Y eso es algo que siempre me gusta de una obra de ficción, que sea reverenciable desde muchos puntos de vista. Una obra muy cuidada. Otro aspecto que me encanta en una obra de este estilo es que el mundo en el que transcurre se sienta realmente vivo y suficientemente real. En este videojuego hay muchísimo lore del cual tirar (esto, obvio, gracias a otras obras de este universo), y eso ayuda mucho a este propósito. Pero no solo eso, el mundo está hecho de tal forma que se siente suficientemente complejo. Pero logra eso sin generar distracciones de lo que nos quiere contar. Sí que encontraremos misiones secundarias y diversos ""coleccionables"", pero cada uno de ellos cuenta algo que sirve para ampliar más nuestro contacto y entendimiento con el universo de los personajes. Por otro lado, creo que nunca jugué un título con una estructura más original. Básicamente todo está dividido en tres partes principales, donde vemos la historia desde varios puntos de vista. Todo para en los compases finales, una vez conozcamos a estos personajes tan entrañables y queribles, llegar al cierre de la misma en un clímax muy épico y emocional. Hay muchísimas rutas para completar este juego (tiene truco eso), lo cual también ayuda a generar complejidad en este título. La historia esta realmente bien llevada y contada. Tiene un gran ritmo, uno que nunca de teda despegarte de la pantalla. Además de momentos realmente emocionales y giros muy interesantes. Y hablando de los personajes, cada uno de ellos se encuentra realmente bien construido. Son muy complejos y todos cargan con un peso en sus espaldas. A nivel jugable son todos muy diferentes entre sí (sumado a que podemos personalizar un poco esa jugabilidad). Finalmente decir que es un título que realmente disfruté mucho en sus casi 40hs que tengo jugadas (solo con la trama principal y algunas secundarias, pero muy pocas). No soy usualmente de títulos tan largo, pero este, así como la saga Mass Effect, entre otros, sin lugar a dudas se merecieron ese tiempo. Deseo probar más de este universo en el futuro.",10,2024-12-16,PC,user

I also didn't liked the pacing of the story the complete bit with 9s was unnecessary and boring and the cutscenes they added in that part didn't justified the longer play time.

aitorsibo,"Cool and mysterious concept, but it just didn't click with me and got unbearable to play. Gameplay is mostly about smashing buttons and I really don't like the combos. I just evade and hit and maintain shooting continuously and that does it. Initially, I liked the sequences mimicking other old genres like side-scrollers with the flying unit, but these genere and camera changes are a bit abused and I got bored quickly. I hate running around the map with no fast travel in sight (i checked and it is given mid game, but I just don't have it in me to make it there). Characters feel repetitive and a bit bland, and so does the game per se. If you check online, you'll see that it is based on multiple playthroughs with you repeating a lot of stuff and doing some new things. No way I would go through that when I'm already feeling it repetitive 3 hours **** thing I have to praise is the score. I'll remember getting to the machine village with everyone waving a white flag while that cute music is playing. I feel like it would take me too much time to maybe get to a point in which I actually enjoy playing, so I'm leaving it early.",6,2024-02-24,PC,user

Gallium,"Truly a great game.There are one or two parts of this game that when I think about them, my heart THROBS in pain. This is how much this game naisl being emotional with success.This could have been a 10/10 but I remove 1 point for the robot protag to be dressed as a robot maid. Why? This is truly unfait to the character,a thirst trap that removes from the rest of the game.I also remove another 1 point for having to chain the game content so many time. It's genius in most part, except when you just need to redo entire parts of the game you already did with no change at all. This parts were boring.Story is good.Characters, revelations, plot reveals, these are great. Then you finish the game, and it propose to you an interesting New Game+. With some original content. This is nice.Then you finish again, and this time you have another New Game+ with only original content that is incredibly painful in an emotional way.

pawq,"First off, urgent advice: before attempting to play NieR:Automata on mouse and keyboard, install the Input Overhaul (NAIOM) - the game is NOT playable without it, and I mean it - in some parts of the game it's impossible to do what's needed because of ridiculous controller>mouse mapping. Some other quality of life mods are recommended too - look up the definitive mod guide on Nexus. Second urgent advice: do not stop playing once you see the end titles for the first time, this is only about half of the story. It's more than worth it to continue until you've obtained endings A-E; it's not just other perspectives later on, it's also literally a continuation of the story. ------------------------------- On one hand, NieR:Automata really deserves a 9/10, but on the other it deserves at most a 7/10. In the end, I'm giving it an 8/10, and below I'll explain why. It deserves a 9/10 because in many ways it's an utterly brilliant game. The concept of the world is fascinating, the few main characters are very authentic, and the story (once you get to the >actual< end!) is so powerful that it left me emotional for days. The world design is charming and memorable, despite sub-par graphics in the vanilla version, voice acting is amazing (the Japanese voice-over is hugely recommended), and the soundtrack is otherworldly - even though there aren't too many tracks there, they're SO GOOOD that I didn't want to stop playing the game just because of the music. Combat is fun and well-balanced too, with a satisfying progression curve. Maybe the strongest suit though is that the game is original and surprising in so many ways. I won't give examples here because it's amazing and you have to see it for yourself! But let's just say that there are at least 6 different modes of gameplay, with virtually seamless transitions. And then we get to the second part - why it deserves a 7/10 at most. It's really down to the fact that I felt compelled to give two pieces of advice at the beginning of the review - part of it is due to it being a terrible port, and part due to questionable design decisions. The game is literally unplayable on mouse & keyboard, which is just unacceptable. Some examples: negative mouse acceleration in 3rd person mode (the faster you move the mouse the slower the camera movement), and broken aiming in side-scrolling mode (mouse movements cause the crosshairs to jump up or down, but it jumps back to horizontal after each increment). Luckily modders sorted this out (in say 98% - there are still minor issues at some stages). And by far the most questionable design decision in my view is the decision to split the game into three playthroughs, forcing the player to essentially replay the game with only minor changes and additions after ""finishing"" the story, in order to get to the actual second part of it, which let's just say is CRUCIAL. Even though at the end of the first playthrough the game tells you ""please continue"" I wasn't sure if I wanted to or if it was worth it - I looked online and saw some people saying it was worth it, so I did, but also saw plenty of people saying they gave up because of the repetitiveness, which is SUCH A SHAME. After playing through the whole thing and thinking and reading about it a lot, I remain unconvinced that this was necessary - I think the different perspectives and elements of the second playthrough could be integrated into the first, just like different perspectives were integrated at the beginning of the 3rd playthrough. It would avoid alienating many players, and make for a more cohesive and less grindy experience. After all the experience was so amazing that I couldn't give less than an 8, but I wish I could give more.",8,2023-04-22,PC,user
MikComposer,"it is a decent game. In terms of gameplay and story it's a mix of old school snes action adventure jrpg's with new more open style design. It has its exciting moments but ultimately it doesn't reach hights it is set out to deliver. At least half of the game feels like a slog, but even so, there was enough fun gameplay in it to reach end of route A, but not enough to continue with other characters. Story style is like other anime; But want point out that anime is heavily influenced by classic Italian Cinema ( movies like warriors of the wasteland 2020) and classic Italian Opera. And that's what it is. Soundtrack is on the other hand stellar. Can hear many composition style influences, from Polish and Bulgarian, to German. And it drives the game. I've listened to this soundtrack more then I've played. All in all it's worth getting at a discount. I'm waiting for the third game and meanwhile maybe I'll check out Replicant.",6,2023-01-11,PC,user
