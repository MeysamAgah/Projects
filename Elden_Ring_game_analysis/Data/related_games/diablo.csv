Motichoor420,"Having played Diablo 2 before this atrocious mess, I had savoured just how many improvements had been made since the original Diablo was made. Not only were the graphics vastly improved, but the gameplay too, plus more. Let me annhilate Diablo 1 to explain myself. Graphics...good, fro a 1996 game, no doubt about that. Music...dull and pointless; are we playing a horror rpg or dungeon crawler? WHATS WITH ALL THAT LOOPED SCREAM!?!? The menu setup is horrendous, you have to click here and there just to choose one item, and there's not enough room. Also, whilst you may power up and beat the hell (pun intended) out of the demonic hordes, when it comes to the main boss per area, boy, does he knock seven bells out of you (your so -called improved armour not only disintegrates per boss blow, but your health gets zapped too, and yes, the flimsy menu does not help either, when u need health, mana, etc). Also, the storyline would have been fab if the game play etc would have been implemented correctly. The monotonous slashing/arrowing flinging, coupled with spells that cant faze the bosses, is just so annoying and repetitive. I gave Dungeon Siege 1 a bad score, but after suffering the repeated humiliation after hours and minutes of leveling up, really made me grind my teeth. Needless to say, I gave it to my local charity shop so someone else could suffer its bizarre shenanigans. And people say this is a world-renowned eye-opener...pfffffffff!!!!!!",2,2024-01-03,PC,user

BFG-1337,"In rating this game as if its 1996, but ill tell you how it holds up now. The atmosphere is the main thing and the village music is stuck in my head with the walking patter sound. You can still enjoy this game if you just forget that its 2021 and imagine you are in 1996.",9,2021-03-28,PC,user
Kai82,"Hard to rate today. Back then I would give a 9/10 and would praise the dark atmosphere, good gameplay and mechanics that keep you going on to improve your character. My negatives would be that it could be longer as I finished the game quite fast and that the conclusion is not that satisfying (but a great set up for Diablo 2). Today it is not that good anymore as newer games have set the bars higher and Diablo 2 is better in all regards. So today I am more in the 6/10 range but must say I am under the influence of nostalgia and it could be worse for those who have not played it before. It is an action RPG and for many a primary example for hack and slash. A mayor aspect is getting better equipment from loot or merchants to steadily improve your character (There is the newer term “Loot porn” for this kind of games;-). The game is set in the town Tristram which was build on / near the ruins of an old monastery. There strange things happen as people vanish and live in a state of fear as there are rumors about the things that lurk in the underground of the ruins. Your character is an adventurer that wants to solve the mystery and explore the ruins. Good set up and atmosphere. Story wise it does a bit more than is needed and I appreciate this especially in its genre. For the gameplay: You chose between 3 characters: Warrior who focuses on melee, rouge who focuses on ranged combat and sorcerer who is specialized in magic. Each one has a unique ability and different limits for the attributes. I used all characters and favor the rogue for ranged attacks as they made the game easier. You get experience by killing monsters and side quests. For each level up you get 5 ability points that can be put into the 4 stats strength, magic, vitality and dexterity. These are connected to lifepoints, mana, hit% etc. There are of cause also items that raise these stats and you are always on the hunt for better loot / equipment. There are ability point restrictions for items and spells. For clarification: You can in theory learn all spells and use all items for all characters. However a warrior has a much lower limit for magic than the sorcerer so that higher level spells are not possible to learn (Don't remember if you can outmaneuver this with equipment that raises the stats). Also it would be a waste to nullify the class advantage but you are free to develop your characters as you want. You explore the underground of the ruins and go deeper and deeper while fighting stronger and stronger enemies. If you do not get better items and level up you will be at a huge disadvantage. The items have rarity levels and the rarer the better as by genre standards. Remark: Uncommon items must be identified and there is a degradation system in place. You can of cause repair these in the town. I already point out the negatives that the game is too short for me and the conclusion can be a disappointment (But is fully justified by lore and story). The graphics were good for its time but did not age that well. Maybe a bit to dark in some places but that is the set up for a dark scary dungeon so I cant complain here to be fair. Overall this was an excellent game for its time and started a successful franchise. I have fond memories of it (“Fresh **** has one of the most loyal fan bases and is well know. I can not recommend it today for new players as I am too biased by nostalgia and newer games make this look inferior. However I can recommend it for those who want to experience the basic of franchises and it gives a clear example how a game series can evolve. I give an 8/10 with a nostalgia bias warning.",8,2021-03-28,PC,user

Kotofon,"Diablo – игра в стиле тактической РПГ, где ты будешь постоянно сталкиваться с различного рода испытаниями, сложность которых постепенно будет возрастать. Возьми на себя исполнение роли отважного бойца и отправляйся на сражение со всеми, кто посмел встать на сторону зла",7,2021-02-26,PC,user
GrimalkinFel,"Now *this* is a true timeless classic ****. As much as I enjoy D2, this first entrance into the franchise is what does it for me. It is likely due in some part to nostalgia bias speaking, as I grew up watching my mum playing this when I was little, then playing it myself. But I will do my best to speak from an objective point of view. tl;dr: 9/10 only because there is of course that retro game clunkiness present in a couple of features. I'm trying to be objective here but for the record my nostalgia would give it a 100/10 :P Pros: > Replayability. I've played and re-played this game countless times. Its replayability is off the charts. Fully randomised maps, randomised enemies from a pool, randomised quests from a pool of I think 4 for each section. So many ways to make each and every play-through unique. I've never had the same run experience twice. > Art style. Hoo boy, that dark and gritty gothic style lends itself so well to the subject and the setting, and complements the graphic capabilities of the time. Even today in 2021 I would say that graphically it holds up decently. It's not perfect by any means, but it looks almost like something faux-retro that an indie team might put out today. But it IS actually retro, and back when it was released, it was ground-breaking in its detail and variety. > Music. Holy christ on a biscuit the score in this game is SO. FREAKING. GOOD. Atmospheric, chillingly eerie and dripping with creep factor. The orchestral choir vocals of the dungeon theme. That little guitar riff in the catacombs. The deep, booming drums in the caves. The distorted baby cries in the hells. And we must not forget those iconic opening strums of the Tristram theme, which creates such a safe harbourage in tone from the chaos of the descent below the cathedral. I cannot express enough how much I adore the score, I listen to it casually on the regular. > Horror. Just go look at the butcher's room. For real though, the game can get downright suspenseful when you're waiting for the next enemy to come running toward you out of the shadows or from around a corner. Sure, it's not P.T. or anything, but it achieves what I think is an impressive amount of thrill and suspense for such a simple top-down dungeon crawler. > Gameplay. Gameplay is in the middle for me. On one hand, I love the way each class is characterised and has its own strengths and weaknesses. There's a little bit of overlap, but not too much, e.g. every class can theoretically learn spells or use every type of armour/weapon, it just depends on how difficult you want to make the game for yourself. :P But, that being said, it is still a click-fest. Careful not to get carpal tunnel here. The generalised stats also leave something to be desired, but I'll give them a little leeway as it's just a dungeon-crawler, not an open-world RPG. We need to be careful not to get too carried away with comparing a game from 1996 to games from 20+ years later. Cons: > Clunkiness. Yeah, the game can be a little clunky. I personally find it charming and am used to it, but I can understand that someone trying to play it for the first time today may struggle a little with slow movement speed, lack of scrolling for vendor item lists, negligible inventory space (which is probably due to monitor sizes at the time), and in the lowest levels often pretty disproportionate enemy spawns that can all but halt your run if they catch you off guard. There's also the distances of Adria and Wurt from the town centre that can grow tiring. Oh and the fun of loading and reloading your game to get the right stuff in the vendors' lists. I recommend muting or you'll have ""well, what can I do for ya?"" and ""I sense a soul in search of answers"" burned into your subconscious lol All-in-all I think that Diablo 1 is a fantastic example **** classic title. It plays well to this day and is short enough to enjoy casually over a few sessions, or even one if you want to and have lucky drops and quest/map pulls. I thoroughly recommend it to anyone wanting to experience something truly atmospheric, timeless and made with love. Go forth and slay those demons!",9,2021-02-20,PC,user

Joewashere,"A lone hero arrives to a dismal village and receives the quest to explore a dreadful dungeon reaching from the accursed damp catacombs of a desecrated church down to the flaming depths of hell. This isn’t about raising numbers, it’s about going down all alone. The strong sense of place and momentum, a remarkably simple yet effective combat system and a prodigious soundtrack which cannot be complimented enough push the player into descending through walls of wailing demonic flesh until reaching Diablo himself -this is a horror tale with nightmarish sounds, grim visuals and a bare-bones RPG system fueling an aggressive gameplay more akin to id’s shooters than to anything else. Everything works like a clock, even that which taken by itself seems unfitting -such as the limited inventory and speed of the playable character- forces the player into constantly making relevant choices with both delayed and instant consequences (i.e. life or death), which account for the rather slim character building. As a proper masterpiece, Diablo is the father **** characterized by a brutal immediacy, set apart from the hordes of clones it spawned -a classic.",10,2019-08-08,PC,user

The thick atmosphere made my young imagination venture to places it had deep yearnings to shape and explore, and the poetry, the tales and books slingshot me into halls from which I had previously been blind...Experiencing Diablo was an honing of my soul, it was testing me on so many levels.

rich_pl,"Now very dated, and 'in comparison' to modern titles seems like a laughable attempt at making a game. BUT - I think this game is among three that I will always hold to be 'top-level' games I still remember the nights poured into this game, I still remember the moments of tension and relief at achieving the various milestones of game play, killing certain bosses or surviving certain levels. And knowing now that this spawned a sequel which in my mind is still unsurpassed in the Action RPG genre - Diablo 2, that fact alone means that this game has to be recognised as part of the pinnacle of PC gaming. Even now I occasionally like to have a little nostalgia and install Diablo 1 just so I can take a big old dose of happy memories. I can't honestly say that anyone should go out and get this game now, but just want everyone to understand that even before today's vast game budgets, before the dedicated teams of artists and environment designers, before all of the impressiveness of modern gaming there were games like this that shone out because they provided fantastic experiences and enticing game play.

DeyvsonCaliman,"No doubt one of games I played the must in my life, incredibly replayable, I could never get bored. This game was so revolutionary that up to this day we say ""Diablo style game"". It's a classic that a player from today world may not enjoy because of it's outdated graphics and a character growth system that is too simple. Even so, at the time, I couldn't believe such master piece. It's one of those addictive games, kill tons of sprites to develop the character until we are strong enough to kill the last boss. And them we are ready to do everything again, because dungeons are aleatory, different characters offer different game-plays and hack n' slash is so fun. Not to mention nice background story, go underground and kill the devil in that gothic environment, I felt medieval.

jrh23,"By 1996, everyone was tired of the dying, cliche, turn-based RPG formula. Diablo saved the genre by bringing it into real-time. Another triumph by Blizzard",10,2015-12-25,PC,user
friendlynerd,"Diablo 1 is still very much fun to play, also in multiplayer mode, 20 years after it was released. From today's perspective, it's basically simplified World of Warcraft, because Blizzard honed their concept of character and gear progression from Diablo 1 to Diablo 2 to World of Warcraft. The strongest feature of Diablo 1 is (and was at the time) its randomly generated dungeons.",10,2015-12-14,PC,user
GolovA,"Wow! What a game! Back then it was like ""Dude, you know Diablo?"" ""As if! It's like the best game EVVVA!"" :) Yeah, those were the times - the times when ""replayability"" actually meant playing the game a gazillion of times, until the CD became razor thin from constant reinstalls, until you could, like, run circles around bosses at character level 1 with your eyes closed, and still enjoy the game! THAT'S REPLAYABILITY. And that was Diablo.",9,2015-12-06,PC,user
Lotian,"Best in the series, in my opinion. Had that dark, grim 'n grity feel. I lost interest in Diablo series since then. It just went arcade, caroonish. Not my preference.",9,2015-10-20,PC,user
retkimuna,this is very fun arpg. graphics has aged well and gameplay is ok. It has some problems but it's no't bad like some kids in reviews say. Diablo 1 is fun nostalgic game.,8,2015-06-12,PC,user
mcfry,"There may be a little nostalghia to my maximum rating, but I also believe this is a perfect casual game. - a simple, smooth and motivating gameplay - different playing styles through items and magic - enormous replay value - involving sound and story If you need to whack some time, this is it. Is it mobile already?",10,2015-02-02,PC,user
Floing,This is the most atmospheric game ever made. Even Diablo 2 pales in comparison with this masterpiece. There is always a sense of dread and some of the monsters can actually become dangerous and feel like a real fight (something Diablo 3 completely lacks). There are some flaws like black deaths permanently screwing you up and wizard being totally overpowered but there are mods to fix that.,10,2014-11-12,PC,user
Kaprawiec,"I remember when I first played demo of first DIABLO. It was just amazing. Music was just perfect. Its way better than those in all new instalments. Dark, heavy atmosphere - again perfect. Innovative loot system. Even story was quite interresting. in 1996 gameplay was really perfect for me. For couple of years to come this was really one of my favourite titles. When I come back to this game now it seems almost like some indie game, its so slow compared to D3. But it still is one of the most important game in gaming history.",10,2014-10-23,PC,user
urieaal,I can still re-install and play this game. That should really say something saying that my only real re-playable games are ff7 and xenogears other then that its truly hard for me to pick up and replay games. In its time it was great and frankly i still like to dupe (dupelicate items) and hax the hell out of it. its just good old fashion fun. Hell if a **** server was going id be on it once in a while.,8,2014-09-27,PC,user
koval321,"This is best Diablo in series. This is how it should look like, exploring dungeon and not running on desert, because open area always look the same even if its random. Torchlight1 was also good game because it keep that style and atmosphere, where am just say best clone, not better game. D1 is best in own style.",10,2014-08-14,PC,user
DeusXCom,"When first Diablo was released in 1996 it blew everyone's mind with it's beautiful visuals, fantastic music, dark atmosphere and incredibly fun and addictive gameplay. I loved and still love every bit of it. It still plays and holds up well until this day and it's by far the best from the trilogy imo. Just listening to the soundtrack and that music is just pure classic. 10/10",10,2014-08-05,PC,user
Zarniwooop,"One of the most important games ever made. It is STILL scary if you play now. The butcher doesn't make me wet my pants like he did the first time anymore, but knowing that if you die, you're going to have to get all your stuff back is just nerve-racking. Possibly the most atmospheric RPG ever made. Or if that's going too far, then easily the best music. The only thing that makes it an adjustment to play today is the lack of run/walk. I play this at least once a year and have since it came out.",10,2014-07-28,PC,user

Nickkix37,It's a good game to most. In my opinion I never like the game play. I don't like point to move nor button mashing. Its very suspenseful with a fantastic story line. The music fits well into the game. Voice acting also was a great feature for the game.,6,2013-05-19,PC,user

Mittsies,My favorite PC game of all time. Truly the most monumental and inspirational action dungeon crawler ever created. It was the game that paved the way for its genre to grow and one of the major reasons why Blizzard became among the greatest game developers of all time.,10,2013-03-09,PC,user
Rox22,"I really love the people who judge this game a decade or more after it's release and hold it up to ""current"" standards and rank it badly. Yes it's a really old game today (or whenever you're reading this) but in its day it was legendary. That's not nostalgia talking, it's fact. While I do have fond memories of the game myself I do remember exactly what I thought of it at the time. A great unique game that was extremely fun to play, but also a tad repetitive and without too much depth. Diablo 1 did change the scene and really gave birth to the modern Hack-n-Slash genre. Overall: While I dod have great respect for this game I also must look at it objectively and not just with nostalgia. A great game of it's age, but also a bit limited and rough around the edges.",7,2013-02-06,PC,user
OmriPC,"This game is a masterpiece. Best graphics for his time period. Story is superb and the sound is **** game includes a fantastic gameplay. This game changed the video games world- from RPG to action. This game is one of the best games ever, if not the best, this is absolutely the finest work of Blizzard Entertainment.",10,2012-12-15,PC,user
Jangle,"If you like this dungeon runner style, you will like Diablo. Aside from the lack of deep story, the action is fun. Playing a melee character, I found difficult as it seems you spend more time chasing enemies than actually attacking them. Once you switch to mage, it is a walk in the park. I ended up using one spell through the whole game, which shows how repetitive it can get. One strong element in the game is the limited but fantastic music. There aren't many tracks, but they are very well done. Very similar to the recent Torchlight I game.",8,2012-12-01,PC,user
MrWESS,"When Blizzard made this game, they made a revolution to RPG world. Everything a real RPG gamer wants is in this game. Let's face it, RPG's were never about graphics, but how invested in your character, in your game, in your mission can game make you. And this game was, and still is one of the BEST games I've ever played. Sadly, Diablo franchise started to deteriorate after this game. Neither of the sequel lived up to this game. Diablo had a real story, and it was like a movie, a novel. Diablo 2 was here and there good, but had some flaws, such as no classic save game in singleplayer, but multiplayer solution to it, and Diablo 3 was a massive failure, Everything that was wrong with Diablo 2, they exaggareted it about 1000 times. Diablo 1 had both simplicity of gaming, and complexitiy of storytelling and questing. That's why Diablo, especiallly with Hellfire expansion is the game, that i play till this day...",10,2012-08-25,PC,user
GREW50ME,"I should really just sum this review up in two words: ""Diablo Clone."" Wait, where did that come from? Oh yeah, it came from this game. If you have never heard of a Diablo clone, then you are pretty much a newb. Diablo copied the action sequences of some popular ASCII games, added in some stellar graphics and sound (for their time), and made a story that would make Lucifer himself cringe. The game was simple, but also had some complexity. The level layouts were completely random. The item drops combined random item properties in a prefix-base-suffix setup in which each randomly generated section had a massive number of possibilities. Skills were not tied to classes, but were instead tied to books that you found on the way! You could be a warrior with fireballs or a wizard in Gothic Plate! Experiment all you wish! There was some great single player, multiplayer via LAN and ****, and most importantly, wide open PKing to add layers of challenge to the game. This game revolutionized the ARPG genre, or perhaps even created it! For what it was in its day, there were very few games to challenge, let alone top it. For this reason, Diablo 1 gets my highest recommendations!",10,2012-07-15,PC,user

wrongpassword,"A revolutionary game for its time in all respects. Yes it had its share of bugs. The words town killed still engenders feelings of deep resentment among old time fans. Yes it does not compare to the richness of current gaming. Though its graphics are aged and outdated, the sound, voice acting and atmosphere are a morosely compelling as it ever was. Few will ever forget their first meeting with the butcher or their battle with the Skeleton King. For many, myself included, it was their first foray into online multiplayer and it was good. It was not the saccharine world of nintendo, the slow turn based strategy games that dominated the PC scene then or the increasingly arcane 2d fighter. It was a dark and accessible world where anyone could enter but few would ever leave. We miss you Blizzard North and we will never forget this game.",10,2012-05-19,PC,user

Randomly generated dungeon levels, dynamic ai, a plethora of weapons armor and items and 3 classes to choose from. This is a one of a kind and practically the first of its kind. A priceless gem of all ages!",10,2012-03-08,PC,user
whitespider999,"While diablo is a weaker 'game' than diablo 2. I think it has a superior atmosphere. However since most of what you do in this game is kill monsters, collect loot, sell loot, return to monsters - the atmospheric bleakness only shows it's stunning head on occasion. For it's time, this game blew my mind. Loot was presented so well, everything was so attractive, what the next floor would bring was a mystery of **** online implementation was second-to-none. I sincerely miss the darkness and gothic morbid feeling of diablo 1. That said, diablo 2 did everything significantly better, and still retained enough of the atmosphere to make the entire package grander. And diablo 2 has a hell of a lot more lasting power due to the massive depth improvements over it's prequel.",7,2012-02-21,PC,user
Kirase,"Released in 96 this game was the first of its kind and generally just as good as it gets. Enjoyed it for countless hours, even more with the hellfire addon and mods like varahya/khans.

Crimsonking58,"Somehow, this game still holds up. Easily one of the most addictive games I've ever played (besides Diablo 2), it's also one of the most mindless (at least if you play as a fighter). Pure point and click, hack and slash simplicity that somehow manages to stay fun throughout. I ended up wishing for a bit more depth near the end of the game, but that's where Diablo 2 comes in. On it's own, this is still great fun.",7,2011-12-26,PC,user

TexasGamer,"When Diablo was released, it was the best RPG of its time. Even though there are only 3 characters does not take away from the gameplay.

If you dont like hack&slash game dont bother to even play it let alone to review it why because its lame and false to give false information about the game. Diablo was back in the days 1997 the hit simpel cd and you are good to go on your 4/86 with 33mhz and 4mb ram (dont forget the turbo mode) yah simple as that new people dont try this because so outdated style you will not like this horribly graphics for this age.

badkarma,"Okay, fans will kill me, but Diablo wasn't that great. I don't know how to explain this game. It's somewhat of a point-and-click-adventure without the adventure-typical riddles and storyline. Some sort of a Last Ninja clone in a fantasy-setting for a more casual audience. A low cost rpg without characters and variety (other than different styles of slaying). This is actually not the worst thing, **** tries to be simple - however Diablo didn't want to be that simple. Cinematics, advertisement and pricing claim to be much more. The procedurally generated levels did not offer as much variety as expected.",6,2011-08-28,PC,user
Apollo,"A great game for its time, sure people complain about how the levels all look the same but truely the are not, they are randomly generated dungeons which give you some of the best replayability. It was a ten for its day and age, and I have a feeling it's comming back with Diablo 3, all for what Ghast said, 96-98 if they remade it with new models, textures, and more customizable classes",10,2011-07-25,PC,user
davenbettridge,"In reviewing Diablo you have remember that video games have developed A LOT over the years, games didnt just spontaneously become as functional and as complex as they are today and Diablo has contributed a step in the progress and evolution of its genre. Diablo 1 was a great game for its time and still holds up very well, its only our impatient side of being over spoilt modern gamers that makes Diablo outdated, but when you stripe impatience aside Diablo becomes one of the timeless greats of the 90s. The design and service of Battle net is perhaps the most important and influence contribution that Diablo brought, the simple and addictive real time gameplay, the item/ loot system, stat character customisation are fantastic. The atmosphere is great (better than Diablo 2 and 3!), the simplicity and charm of the monster and environment design, the gothic story, the dark tones of despair, the random level generator all were original at its time and have since been copied and recopied in the industry today. Diablo is one of my favourites and a great and important game of its time.",9,2011-07-19,PC,user

davengo,"The original Diablo not only ushered in an era of clickfest action-RPGs for the PC, it probably also helped revive interest in computer roleplaying games in general, though ironically action-RPGs eventually killed off hardcore RPGs five year later, with Arcanum being the final game of that era (that said, Diablo is not actually that far from the hardcore dungeon crawling RPGs like the Icewind Dale and Might & Magic series). Diablo may not be as refined as later action-RPGs, nor as deep as the hardcore RPGs, but the gameplay still enjoyable, rewarding, and addictve, with a unique gothic fantasy setting, well-emphasized by the dark, heavy and genuinely creepy atmosphere permeates through the game, an atmosphere that was sadly and sorely lacking in Diablo II (which I consider to be an inferior game, for this reason). I'd go as far to say that the original Diablo is one of the most atmospheric roleplaying games ever released - and atmosphere is very important for roleplaying games.",9,2011-05-26,PC,user
